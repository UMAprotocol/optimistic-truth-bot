Prompt creation utilities for the UMA Large Language Oracle project.

This module provides functions to:
- Generate system prompts for the Perplexity API that guide LLM responses
- Create formatted message structures for API calls
- Include timestamp information to ensure responses consider temporal context
- Support multiple prompt versions with easy selection

        "IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). "

        "Do not assume that statements made in related discussions necessarily apply unless explicitly included in the scope of the market."
        "When multiple sources provide conflicting, incomplete, or unclear information, return p4."
        "Only return p1 or p2 if the evidence is unambiguous, direct, and fully meets the markets resolution criteria with no room for doubt."
