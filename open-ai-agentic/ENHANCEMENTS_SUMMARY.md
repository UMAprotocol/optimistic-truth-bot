# ðŸš€ Enhanced PolyMarket Oracle Agentic System

## âœ… Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **Code Runner with Sample Function Templates**

**Enhanced the Code Runner agent with proven function templates from the original system:**

- **Binance Price Queries**: Complete template with timezone handling, fallback endpoints, and error recovery
- **MLB Sports Data**: Team mapping, game result fetching with date range checking
- **Comprehensive API Support**: Templates for NBA, NFL, NHL, CFB, CBB with proper error handling

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Proven code patterns that work with real APIs
- âœ… Proper timezone conversion for crypto queries
- âœ… Robust error handling with fallback endpoints
- âœ… Correct resolution mapping (p1/p2/p3/p4)

### 2. **Web Search Capabilities for Perplexity Solver**

**Replaced simple Perplexity API wrapper with OpenAI's WebSearchTool:**

- **Strategic Search Approach**: Multi-stage search strategy for comprehensive information gathering
- **Source Verification**: Prioritizes official sources and cross-validates information
- **Temporal Awareness**: Distinguishes between past events (verifiable) and future events (uncertain)
- **Conservative Evaluation**: Defaults to p3 when information is contradictory or unclear

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Real-time web search capabilities
- âœ… Access to current information and breaking news
- âœ… Better source quality and verification
- âœ… More sophisticated analysis and reasoning

### 3. **Enhanced Configuration Integration**

**Deep integration with `api_keys_config.json`:**

- **Router Enhancement**: API sources inform routing decisions
- **Code Runner Context**: Detailed API configuration passed to code generation
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: System adapts to available data sources

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Smarter routing based on available APIs
- âœ… Better code generation with API-specific details
- âœ… Flexible configuration without code changes

### 4. **Comprehensive Retry and Exclusion Logic**

**Multi-level retry system with intelligent solver exclusion:**

- **Routing Phase Tracking**: Multiple routing attempts with different solver combinations
- **Market Alignment Checks**: Exclude solvers that consistently contradict strong market signals
- **Journey Documentation**: Complete tracking of all attempts and decisions

**Benefits:**
- âœ… More resilient to individual solver failures
- âœ… Learns from market feedback to improve routing
- âœ… Complete audit trail for debugging and analysis

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Code Runner Templates Integration

The Code Runner agent now includes proven templates directly in its instructions:

```python
# Binance Template (embedded)
def get_close_price_at_specific_time(date_str, hour=12, minute=0, timezone_str="US/Eastern", symbol="BTCUSDT"):
    # Timezone conversion with pytz
    # Primary + fallback endpoint handling
    # Proper error handling and logging
    
# MLB Template (embedded)  
def get_mlb_game_result(date_str, team1, team2):
    # Team name mapping and normalization
    # Multi-date range checking
    # Game status handling (Postponed, Canceled, Final)
```

### Web Search Strategy

The enhanced Perplexity solver uses a systematic search approach:

1. **Broad Topic Search**: Initial search for main subject
2. **Specific Detail Search**: Targeted searches for dates, people, events
3. **Official Source Search**: Look for primary sources and announcements
4. **Cross-Validation Search**: Verify information across multiple sources
5. **Update Search**: Check for latest developments or corrections

### Enhanced Prompts

Both agents now have significantly enhanced instruction sets:

- **Code Runner**: Detailed templates, error handling patterns, resolution mapping guidance
- **Web Search**: Strategic search methodology, source evaluation criteria, conservative decision making

## ðŸ“Š Expected Performance Improvements

### Code Runner Accuracy
- **Before**: Generic code generation, frequent API errors
- **After**: Proven templates with robust error handling and fallbacks

### Web Search Quality  
- **Before**: Single API call to Perplexity
- **After**: Multi-stage web search with source verification and cross-validation

### System Resilience
- **Before**: Single point of failure per solver
- **After**: Multi-level retry with intelligent exclusion and re-routing

### Market Alignment
- **Before**: Basic overseer evaluation
- **After**: Market sentiment integration with solver exclusion based on performance

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Production

The enhanced system maintains full compatibility with the original multi-operator system while providing:

1. **Better Code Execution**: Proven templates reduce API failures
2. **Superior Research**: Web search provides current, verified information
3. **Smarter Routing**: API-aware routing with market feedback integration
4. **Complete Tracking**: Full journey documentation for analysis and debugging

The system is now ready for production testing with proper API credentials and should demonstrate significantly improved accuracy and reliability compared to both the original multi-operator system and the initial agentic implementation.
