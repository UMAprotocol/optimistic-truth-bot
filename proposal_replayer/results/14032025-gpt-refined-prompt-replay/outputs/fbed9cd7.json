If the area is not shaded red by June 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOnce Russia captures the railroad station, any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.\n\nTrain Station Location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sudzha+train+station.png\n\nSudzha Location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sudzha+location.jpeg\n\nLocation on Google maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/s7MXZ3FSQBaVkAMk9\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the query. The user wants to know if Russia will recapture Sudzha by June 30, 2025, based on the ISW map's depiction of the Sudzha railroad station. The resolution depends on whether the station is shaded red (Russian control) by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of Sudzha. The search results mention that Russia recaptured Sudzha in March 2025. Sources [2], [6], [8], [9], and [11] all confirm that Russian forces took control of Sudzha around March 12-13, 2025. The ISW reports (sources [3], [6], [8], [13], [15]) also note that Russian forces have been advancing and consolidating their positions in the area, including the Sudzha railroad station. \n\nSince the current date in the scenario is March 14, 2025, and the resolution date is June 30, 2025, the key point is whether Russia has already captured the station by now. The ISW's March 12 report (source [6]) states that Russian forces seized Sudzha, and subsequent reports mention clearing operations and further advances. The DeepState map (source [4]) also shows Sudzha as no longer under Ukrainian control. \n\nThe railroad station's capture is part of controlling Sudzha. Given that Russia has already taken the town and the station is within it, the condition for \"Yes\" is met. Even if there were temporary glitches or later losses, the resolution criteria state that once captured, subsequent losses don't affect the outcome. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) because the station was captured before the deadline.\n</think>\n\nRussia recaptured Sudzha, a strategically vital town in Kursk Oblast, by March 13, 2025, according to multiple verified reports. The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed the liberation of Sudzha along with neighboring settlements like Melovoy and Podol, with geolocated footage showing Russian troops raising their flag in the town center[2][6][9][11]. This operation involved coordinated assaults by Russian airborne (VDV) units, naval infantry, and Spetsnaz forces, including a surprise infiltration through a disused gas pipeline[10][12].\n\nThe Sudzha railroad station, located at coordinates 51\u00b011'29\"N 35\u00b016'14\"E, fell under Russian control during this offensive. Satellite imagery and frontline maps from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) showed Russian advances into Sudzha's industrial zone and central districts by March 12[3][6][8]. Ukraine's DeepState monitoring project updated its map on March 12 to reflect the loss of Ukrainian control over Sudzha, with only western areas remaining contested[4].\n\nGiven that:\n1. Russia already controls Sudzha as of March 2025  \n2. The railroad station is within the town's administrative boundaries  \n3. ISW's March 12 assessment explicitly confirms Russian seizure of Sudzha[6]  \n4. No credible reports suggest Ukrainian forces regained control after March 13  \n\nThe condition for a \"Yes\" resolution (p2) has been met. Subsequent battlefield developments before June 30, 2025, do not affect this determination under the market's rules, which state that initial capture suffices regardless of later reversals. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
