  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how a specific market should resolve based on the outcome of the 76ers vs. Raptors game on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Raptors, p2 for 76ers, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game was on March 12, 2025. Sources [4], [5], [9], [10], [11], and [12] all confirm the game took place. The YouTube video from March 12, 2025, titled \"Raptors vs 76ers Game 66\" and others like the CBS News article [9] report the Raptors won 118-105. \n\nNext, I need to verify the final score and outcome. Multiple sources, including the box score from Fox Sports [10] and the game recap from CBS [9], state the Raptors won. The final score was 118-105 in favor of Toronto. \n\nI should also check if there were any postponements or cancellations. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. No mentions of delays or cancellations. \n\nSince the game was completed and the Raptors won, the market should resolve to p1. The 76ers didn't win, so p2 isn't applicable. There's no indication of a cancellation, so p3 isn't needed. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers vs. Toronto Raptors game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET was played as planned. The Toronto Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers with a final score of **118-105**[9][11][12]. Key performances included AJ Lawson (28 points), Jared Rhoden (25 points, 12 rebounds), and Orlando Robinson (25 points, 12 rebounds) for Toronto, while Philadelphia's Quentin Grimes scored 29 points[9][12]. Both teams fielded heavily depleted rosters due to injuries and rest decisions[9][12].\n\nSince the game was completed without postponement or cancellation, the market resolves to **p1 (Raptors)** based on the outcome. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
