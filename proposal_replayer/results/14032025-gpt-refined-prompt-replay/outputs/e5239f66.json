  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Clippers vs. Heat game on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Heat, p2 for Clippers, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after March 12. So the game should have already taken place. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game occurred. Sources [1], [6], and [7] all mention the game on March 12, with the Clippers winning 119-104. \n\nSource [1] from CBS News states the Clippers beat the Heat 119-104. ESPN's recap [6] also reports the same score. YouTube highlights [2] and [7] back this up, showing the game happened. The betting prediction in source [3] was for the Clippers to win, which aligns with the actual result. \n\nSince the game was played and the Clippers won, the market should resolve to p2 (Clippers). There's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game being completed as scheduled with a Clippers victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Miami Heat 119-104 on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][6][7]. Key contributors included Bogdan Bogdanovic (30 points) and Ivica Zubac (26 points, 14 rebounds), while James Harden added 24 points and 11 assists[1][6]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the search results.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
