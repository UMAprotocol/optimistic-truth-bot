  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Timberwolves vs. Nuggets game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Nuggets, p2 for Timberwolves, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, so the game date (March 12) has already passed. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources [1][2][5][7] report that the game took place on March 12, 2025. The Timberwolves won 115-95. The sources are from reputable sports sites like CBS Sports, SI.com, and Fox Sports, which adds credibility.\n\nNext, I need to confirm there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All the search results discuss the game's outcome, indicating it was played as scheduled. There's no information suggesting a cancellation or postponement. \n\nSince the game occurred and the Timberwolves won, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Timberwolves\"). The user's personalization rules state that if the event has occurred and is verified, we use the correct resolution. Also, since the event date is in the past relative to the current date, there's no issue with it being a future event. \n\nI should also check if any sources contradict this, but all point to a Timberwolves victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Denver Nuggets 115-95 in their March 12, 2025 NBA game. Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 29 points, supported by Julius Randle's 25 points, while Nikola Jokic scored 34 points for the Nuggets in a losing effort. Minnesota never trailed in the game and extended their winning streak to six games[1][2][5][7].  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- Final score: Timberwolves 115, Nuggets 95  \n- Minnesota improved to 3-0 against Denver this season  \n- The game concluded without postponement or cancellation[1][5]  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
