  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296117 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:08:37 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Timberwolves vs. Nuggets game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Timberwolves win, it's p2; if the Nuggets win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually happened on that date. Looking at the search results, there's a recap from ESPN (source [1]) dated March 13, 2025, which is the day after the game. The recap states that the Timberwolves defeated the Nuggets 115-95 on March 12. This directly answers the outcome. \n\nAdditionally, source [5] from Fox Sports confirms the same result, mentioning the Timberwolves never trailed and won 115-95. The spread and total bets are discussed, but the key point is the Timberwolves' victory. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Source [4] and [8] discuss game cancellations due to weather, but those are from January 2025 and involve different teams (Hawks vs. Rockets, Lakers, Clippers). The March 12 game between Timberwolves and Nuggets isn't mentioned as postponed or canceled in any of the provided sources. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and the Timberwolves won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no conflicting information in the search results, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Denver Nuggets 115-95 in their March 12, 2025, NBA game[1][5]. Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 29 points, while Julius Randle added 25 points, extending Minnesota's winning streak to six games[1]. The Nuggets never led in the contest, with Nikola Jokic's 34-point effort proving insufficient for Denver[1][5]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation[1][5], meeting all scheduled conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
