  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296395 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:13:15 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Charlotte vs. Rice college basketball game played on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Charlotte wins, it resolves to \"Charlotte\" (p2), if Rice wins, to \"Rice\" (p1), and if canceled, 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query mentions March 12 at 1:00 PM ET. The current date provided is March 18, 2025, so the game is in the past. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources report the outcome. Source [1] is the Charlotte 49ers' official site, stating they defeated Rice 64-61. Source [4] from Rice's official site confirms the loss, and source [6] also details Rice's defeat. Additionally, source [8] from the American Athletic Conference's site corroborates the result. All these are reliable, primary sources. \n\nThe score is consistent across these sources: Charlotte 64, Rice 61. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all reports discuss the game's details and outcome. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2, corresponding to Charlotte's victory. No conflicting information exists in the search results, so the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Charlotte 49ers defeated the Rice Owls 64-61 in the first round of the 2025 AAC Men's Basketball Tournament on March 12, 2025[1][4][8]. Trailing by 11 points at halftime, Charlotte staged a second-half comeback fueled by strong performances from Giancarlo Rosado and Nik Graves (18 points each) and Kylan Blackmon's 12 second-half points[1][4]. The game was decided in the final seconds when Rosado made two clutch free throws with 6.4 seconds remaining, followed by a Rice turnover on the ensuing inbound play[1][8].\n\nKey factors in the outcome:\n- **Second-half turnaround**: Charlotte shot 52.2% from the field after halftime compared to Rice's 34.6%[1][4]\n- **Free throw disparity**: Charlotte made 26/34 free throws (76.5%) vs Rice's 14/22 (63.6%)[4][6]\n- **Three-point struggles**: Rice went 1-13 (7.7%) from beyond the arc[1][4]\n\nThe game concluded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation[1][4][8]. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market should resolve to **Charlotte** as the winner.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
