  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296414 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:13:34 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for a basketball game between North Carolina Central and MD Eastern Shore scheduled for February 22, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve based on the game's outcome. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled or if it was postponed or canceled. Looking at the search results, there's mention of multiple postponements due to weather. For instance, result [13] states that the game was originally scheduled for February 22 but was postponed to February 26. Another result [7] mentions a postponement from January 5 to January 7 due to weather, but that's a different date. The key here is the February 22 game. \n\nResult [13] explicitly says the men's game against Maryland Eastern Shore was moved to February 26. Then, looking at the game recap in results [1], [2], [5], [6], [11], [12], and [14], the game on February 26, 2025, ended with Maryland Eastern Shore winning 68-59. \n\nSince the original date was February 22 but it was postponed to February 26, the market should remain open until the game is completed. However, the game was indeed played on the rescheduled date, and MD Eastern Shore won. According to the resolution conditions, if MD Eastern Shore wins, the market resolves to p1. \n\nI need to confirm that the game in question is the same one that was postponed. The ancillary data refers to the February 22 game, which was moved to February 26. The rescheduled game was completed, so the outcome is known. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (MD Eastern Shore). \n\nNo conflicting information in the search results suggests the game was canceled or resulted in a 50-50 split. All sources agree on the outcome of the February 26 game. Thus, the correct recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe game between North Carolina Central and Maryland Eastern Shore originally scheduled for February 22, 2025, was **postponed due to inclement weather** and rescheduled to February 26, 2025[13]. The rescheduled game was played on February 26, with **Maryland Eastern Shore winning 68-59**[1][2][5][12][14]. \n\nKey details:\n- **Final score**: UMES 68, NCCU 59  \n- **Key performers**: UMES\u2019 Evan Johnson (19 points) and Ketron Shaw (16 points, 12 rebounds) led the Hawks[14], while NCCU\u2019s Perry Smith Jr. scored 18 points[2].  \n- **Impact**: This marked UMES\u2019 first MEAC win of the season[5] and snapped an 11-game losing streak[14].  \n\nSince the game was completed on the rescheduled date and Maryland Eastern Shore won, the market resolves to **p1** (MD Eastern Shore).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
