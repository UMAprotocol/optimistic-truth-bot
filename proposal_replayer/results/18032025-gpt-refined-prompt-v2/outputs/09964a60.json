  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296103 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:08:23 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know whether Club Brugge or Aston Villa advanced in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16, based on the provided search results. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Aston Villa, p2 is Club Brugge, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is postponed or canceled beyond December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the dates of the matches. The first leg was on March 4, 2025, and the second leg on March 12, 2025, as per sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [8], [13], [14], [15]. Both legs have already been played, so there's no postponement or cancellation here. That rules out p3.\n\nNext, looking at the aggregate scores. The first leg at Club Brugge ended 1-3 in favor of Aston Villa (sources [2], [3], [6], [14]). The second leg at Aston Villa's home, Villa Park, ended 3-0 for Aston Villa (sources [1], [10], [13], [14], [15]). Adding both legs, the aggregate is 6-1 to Aston Villa. \n\nMultiple sources confirm that Aston Villa advanced to the quarter-finals. For example, source [1] states they \"marched into the Champions League quarterfinals,\" and source [15] explicitly mentions the aggregate score. There's no conflicting information in the search results; all point to Villa's victory. \n\nThe resolution conditions require official UEFA sources. Source [6] is from UEFA.com, which is the official site, and it mentions Villa's 3-1 first-leg advantage leading to their quarter-final entry. Additionally, the second-leg result is covered in UEFA's preview and other reliable sports outlets like ESPN and Eurosport. \n\nNo sources indicate that Club Brugge advanced or that the match was unresolved. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 (Aston Villa).\n</think>\n\nAston Villa advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals after defeating Club Brugge 6-1 on aggregate in their Round of 16 tie. The first leg on March 4, 2025, ended 3-1 in favor of Aston Villa[2][3][6], with goals from Leon Bailey, an own goal by Brandon Mechele, and a penalty by Marco Asensio[2][3]. The second leg on March 12, 2025, saw Villa secure a 3-0 victory at Villa Park, with Asensio scoring twice and Ian Maatsen adding another[1][13][14]. Club Brugge\u2019s chances diminished after Kyriani Sabbe\u2019s 16th-minute red card in the second leg[1][14]. \n\nThe aggregate result (6-1) confirms Aston Villa\u2019s progression to face Paris Saint-Germain in the quarterfinals[1][11][15]. Official UEFA sources and multiple match reports corroborate this outcome[1][6][15]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
