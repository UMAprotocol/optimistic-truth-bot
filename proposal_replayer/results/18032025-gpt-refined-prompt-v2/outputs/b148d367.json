  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742296612 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:16:52 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market question about whether the price of eggs went up in Trump's first month in office, specifically comparing February 2025 to January 2025. The ancillary data defines the resolution conditions: \"Yes\" (p2) if February's price is higher than January's, \"No\" (p1) otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current timestamp is March 18, 2025, so February 2025 is in the past. That means the event has already occurred, and the data should be available. The resolution source is the BLS CPI report for February 2025, which was scheduled for release on March 12, 2025. Since today is March 18, that report should be out.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention egg prices in January and February 2025. Source [1] states that the average price increased from $2.52 in January 2024 to $4.95 in January 2025, but that's a year-over-year comparison. However, source [9] provides a table showing January 2025 at $4.953 per dozen and February 2025 at $5.897. That's a clear month-over-month increase. Source [10] also mentions the CPI for eggs was up 13.8% from December 2024 to January 2025, and source [4] notes an 18% increase since Trump's inauguration, which was in January 2025. \n\nWait, source [4] says the average price was $7.74 as of February 18, 2025, which is higher than January's $4.95. However, source [9] reports February's average as $5.897. There's a discrepancy here. Need to check which source is more reliable. Source [9] is from priceofgoods.com, which might be aggregating data, while source [4] is from truthout.org. However, the BLS data (resolution source) is the authoritative one. \n\nLooking at source [2], the market question's own description, the resolution is based on the BLS data. Source [9] cites the St. Louis Fed's data, which aligns with the BLS. The key figure is the February price compared to January. According to source [9], January was $4.953 and February $5.897, which is a 19.1% increase. That's a clear \"Yes\" for the market resolution. \n\nAdditionally, source [10] mentions that by March 4, 2025, the daily price was $8.15, indicating a continued rise. Even though some sources might have varying numbers, the BLS data from the resolution source would be definitive. Since the ancillary data specifies using the BLS report, and the search results from [9] and [10] align with that, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether the price of eggs (Grade A, Large, Cost per Dozen) increased from January 2025 to February 2025, using BLS CPI data as the resolution source.  \n\nAccording to the BLS-aligned data from the St. Louis Fed ([APU0000708111](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000708111)), the average price rose from **$4.953 per dozen in January 2025** to **$5.897 per dozen in February 2025**, a **19.1% month-over-month increase**[9]. This upward trend is corroborated by multiple sources:  \n- Retail egg prices jumped **18%** between Trump\u2019s January 2025 inauguration and mid-February 2025[4].  \n- The CPI for eggs increased **13.8%** from December 2024 to January 2025, with further spikes in February[10].  \n\nThe primary driver of this surge was the ongoing Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak, which reduced egg-laying chicken populations by over 35 million birds in early 2025 alone[10]. Supply constraints and inflationary pressures solidified the price increase.  \n\nSince the February 2025 CPI data confirms a higher egg price than January 2025, the market resolves to **Yes**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
