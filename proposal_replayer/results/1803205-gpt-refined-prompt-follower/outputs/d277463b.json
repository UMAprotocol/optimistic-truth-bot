  "user_prompt": "system: You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for a college basketball game between Saint Louis and Arkansas State. The event date is March 18, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The current timestamp provided is March 19, 2025, 02:58:27 UTC, which is the next day. So first, I need to check if the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, especially result [16] from ESPN PH, it shows the final score as Arkansas State 101, Saint Louis 75. The game was part of the NIT - 1st Round. The detailed stats confirm that Arkansas State won. Another source, [17] from ESPN, also lists the game with Arkansas State as the winner, 101-75. These are reliable sources, and the scores are specific, so the event did occur, and Arkansas State won. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Arkansas State wins, the market resolves to p1. Since the game happened and the result is verified, the recommendation should be p1. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't needed. All conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Saint Louis Billikens vs. Arkansas State Red Wolves NIT first-round game occurred on March 18, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. Verified results from ESPN's live score tracking show **Arkansas State defeated Saint Louis 101-75**[16][17]. The game concluded with a decisive victory for Arkansas State, meeting the resolution condition for \"Arkansas State win\" as defined in the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
