  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether a specific market should resolve to \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether Donald Trump declassified JFK files by April 29, 2025. The current date given is March 18, 2025, which is before the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event's timeframe. The deadline is April 29, 2025, and today is March 18, 2025. Since the current date is before the deadline, the event hasn't occurred yet. According to the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4. \n\nNext, I should verify if there's any information about Trump declassifying the files before the deadline. However, since the current date is March 2025 and the deadline is April 2025, any actions taken after March 18 wouldn't be known yet. The sources provided don't mention any declassification events up to March 18, 2025. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that p2 is for \"Yes\" and p4 is for unresolved future events. Since the event's outcome can't be determined yet, the correct recommendation is p4. I need to ensure that I'm not considering any information beyond the current timestamp. \n\nTherefore, the answer should clearly state that the event is still in the future and recommend p4.\n</think>\n\nThe market resolution depends on whether Donald Trump declassified any JFK assassination files by April 29, 2025 (11:59 PM ET). As of the current timestamp (March 18, 2025), this deadline has not yet passed. The resolution criteria explicitly state that announcements without implementation within the timeframe don't count, and no verified declassification actions have occurred as of March 18, 2025[1].\n\nSince the event window remains open until April 29, 2025, and no conclusive outcome can be determined before that date, this request cannot be resolved at the current time. \n\nrecommendation: p4",
