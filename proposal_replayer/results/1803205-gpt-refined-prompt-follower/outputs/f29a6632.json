  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for an NHL game between the Seattle Kraken and Chicago Blackhawks scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kraken win, the market resolves to \"Kraken\" (p2), if the Blackhawks win, it's \"Blackhawks\" (p1), and other conditions for postponement or cancellation.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time provided: March 19, 2025, 03:01:13 UTC. The game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, 8:30 PM ET, which is March 19, 2025, 00:30 UTC. Since the current time is 03:01 UTC on March 19, the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [10] from Plain Text Sports shows the final score as Kraken 6, Blackhawks 2. This is a direct report of the game result, indicating a Kraken victory.\n- Other sources like ESPN [7] and Fox Sports [5] also list the game as having taken place, with the Kraken winning. The detailed box score in [10] confirms the score breakdown by period and goals scored.\n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game having been played as scheduled with the Kraken winning. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Kraken).\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Seattle Kraken and Chicago Blackhawks scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET (March 19, 2025, 00:30 UTC) has concluded. Verified sources confirm the **Seattle Kraken defeated the Chicago Blackhawks with a final score of 6-2**[10]. The game was played as scheduled without postponement or cancellation[7][10]. \n\nAccording to the ancillary data, a Kraken victory corresponds to resolution **p2**. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
