  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741815149\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 22:32:29",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this query. The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"Biden\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. Wait, no, the query actually mentions Donald Trump and Miche\u00e1l Martin. Let me check again. Oh right, the query is about whether Trump says \"Biden\" during his press conference with Martin. The user provided search results related to that event.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the event details. The press conference is part of the St. Patrick's Day reception scheduled for 5 PM ET on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether Trump utters the word \"Biden\" during that specific press conference. The search results mention that Trump and Martin held meetings, including a press conference in the Oval Office and a reception in the East Room.\n\nLooking at the sources, especially the Washington Times article [1], it describes their meeting, including a press conference in the Oval Office before their closed-door meeting. Another source [15] mentions remarks made by Trump during the press conference, where he discussed tariffs and Ukraine. The CBS News report [16] also covers the event but doesn't mention Trump saying \"Biden.\" \n\nNone of the search results indicate that Trump mentioned \"Biden\" during the press conference. The discussions focused on trade, Ukraine, and EU relations. Since there's no evidence of Trump using the term \"Biden\" in the provided context, the resolution should be \"No.\" Also, the event took place as scheduled, so the cancellation clause doesn't apply. Therefore, the answer should resolve to p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
