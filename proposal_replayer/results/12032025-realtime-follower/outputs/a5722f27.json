  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741827483\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 01:58:03",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a prediction market question about the outcome of a college basketball game between Air Force and UNLV scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins the game. If UNLV wins, it's p1; if Air Force wins, p2; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current timestamp given is March 13, 2025, 01:56:02, which is after the scheduled game time. So the game should have happened. But the search results provided are all previews and predictions from before the game. There are no actual results or post-game reports. The latest article is from March 12, 2025, but it's a preview. The game was supposed to happen on March 12 at 7 PM ET, which would be March 13 in UTC if the location is Las Vegas (PT time zone). Wait, Las Vegas is PT, which is UTC-8. So 7 PM PT on March 12 would be 03:00 UTC on March 13. The current time given is March 13, 01:56:02 UTC, which is before the game would have started. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me double-check time zones.\n\nThe game is scheduled for 7 PM ET on March 12. ET is UTC-5. So 7 PM ET is 00:00 UTC on March 13. The current timestamp is March 13, 01:56:02 UTC, which is 1 hour and 56 minutes after the game was supposed to start. So the game should have concluded by now. However, none of the search results provide the actual outcome. All the sources are previews, predictions, or historical data up to March 12 but before the game. The latest article from March 12 is still a preview, not a result. \n\nSince there's no post-game information in the provided search results, I can't confirm the actual outcome. The user's instructions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, resolve to p4. But according to the timestamp, the current time is after the game's scheduled start. However, without any post-game data, I can't verify the result. The system must rely solely on the provided search results. Since all sources are predictions and there's no actual result reported, the resolution can't be determined from the given data. But according to the rules, if the event is in the past, we should resolve based on verified facts. However, the absence of result data here complicates things. \n\nWait, the current time in the personalization is March 13, 2025, 01:56:02 (UTC). The game was scheduled for March 12, 7 PM ET, which is March 13, 00:00 UTC. So the game would have just started an hour and 56 minutes ago. Depending on the duration, the game might still be ongoing or just finished. But without any results in the search context, I can't confirm the outcome. The user's instruction says to resolve based strictly on verified facts. If there's no verified result available in the sources, and the event time is past, but no data, maybe it's considered unresolved. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But here, the event time was in the past (current time is after the scheduled start). But without results, perhaps the market remains open. Wait, the resolution conditions say if the game is postponed, it remains open. If canceled, resolves to p3. But if the game was played and the result isn't available in the sources, how to proceed?\n\nThe user's instructions state that the AI must base the resolution on verified facts from the provided search results. Since all the search results are pre-game, there's no verified outcome. Therefore, according to the rules, if the event hasn't occurred yet (but the timestamp is after the scheduled time), but there's no result available, it's unclear. However, the personalization says to check if the event is scheduled for a future date or time. Since the current time is after the scheduled start, but no result is present, perhaps the system should default to p4 (cannot be resolved now) if the event is in the future. Wait, but the event's scheduled time has passed. The conflict here is between the timestamp being after the event's start but no results available. \n\nIn this case, the correct approach is to check if the event has occurred. Since the current time is after the event's scheduled time, but the provided context doesn't include the result, the AI can't confirm the outcome. The user's instructions say to answer based on the provided search results. Since there's no post-game data, the AI can't verify the result, so it's as if the event hasn't occurred yet. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the event is considered to have occurred, but without data, the resolution would be p3 (canceled). However, the user's conditions state that p3 is only if the game is canceled entirely. There's no indication of cancellation in the sources. All sources refer to the game happening as scheduled. Therefore, the absence of result data might mean the market remains open, but the resolution rules don't account for that. The user's instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. Since the current time is after the scheduled start time, but the AI has no information on the outcome, perhaps it's considered unresolved and returns p4. However, the event is in the past, so p4 is for future events. This is a tricky edge case. \n\nAlternatively, the AI might infer that since all sources predict a UNLV win, but without confirmation, it's still unresolved. However, the instructions strictly require verified facts. Predictions aren't facts. Therefore, without verified results, the AI can't confirm the outcome and must return p4 if the event is in the future. Wait, but the event's scheduled time is in the past relative to the current timestamp. Therefore, it's not a future event. So p4 doesn't apply. The AI is supposed to resolve based on whether the event occurred. Since the event time has passed, but no result is available, the correct response would be to check if the game was played. If it was played, but no data, perhaps the market remains open. However, according to the resolution conditions, if the game is postponed, it remains open. If canceled, resolves to p3. But there's no info on postponement or cancellation. All sources indicate the game was scheduled and expected to proceed. Therefore, the absence of result data might be an oversight, but according to the rules, the AI must answer based on available information. Since there's no result, the AI can't confirm the outcome and thus can't resolve to p1 or p2. However, the instructions say if the event is in the future, use p4. Since the event's scheduled time has passed, it's not a future event. Therefore, the AI might have to default to p3 (canceled), but there's no evidence of cancellation. Alternatively, the market remains open, but the resolution options don't include that. \n\nThis is a complex scenario. The correct approach here, following the user's instructions, is to check if the event is in the future. The event was scheduled for March 12, 7 PM ET, which is March 13, 00:00 UTC. The current timestamp is March 13, 01:56:02 UTC, which is 1 hour and 56 minutes after the scheduled start. Therefore, the event is in the past. However, without any post-game data, the AI can't verify the result. The user's instructions say to base the resolution strictly on verified facts. Since there are no verified facts (i.e., actual game results) in the provided search results, the AI can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, according to the rules, if the event has occurred but the outcome isn't verifiable, perhaps it's considered unknown, leading to p3. But the resolution conditions state p3 is for canceled games. Since there's no info on cancellation, this might not apply. The instructions are a bit ambiguous here. \n\nGiven the strictness of the rules, the AI must only use the provided search results. Since all results are pre-game, there's no actual result. Therefore, the AI can't confirm the outcome and must treat it as if the event hasn't occurred yet, which contradicts the timestamp. Alternatively, the AI might have to conclude that since the event is past but no result is available, it's unresolved and defaults to p4. However, p4 is for future events. This is a conflict. \n\nIn such cases, the safest approach according to the user's instructions is: if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the current timestamp is after the event's scheduled time, it's not a future event. Therefore, the AI should look for verified results. Since none are available, it can't resolve to p1 or p2. However, the instructions don't cover this exact scenario. The closest is if the event is canceled, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the AI must return p4 only if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past, but no result is available, perhaps the AI has to answer based on the latest available data, which are predictions. However, the user's instructions prohibit predicting and require verified facts. Therefore, the AI can't use predictions. \n\nThis is a corner case not fully covered by the instructions. Given the strictness, the AI should respond with p4 if the event is in the future. But the event is in the past. Therefore, the AI must check if the event occurred. Since the event time has passed, but there's no result, the AI can't confirm the outcome and thus can't resolve the market. However, the resolution conditions don't have an option for unresolved due to lack of information. The options are p1, p2, p3, or p4. Since the event is in the past, p4 (future event) doesn't apply. The AI is stuck. \n\nIn this case, the correct answer is p4 because the provided context doesn't include the result, and the AI can't verify the outcome. But according to the timestamp, the event is in the past. However, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is scheduled for a future date or time. Since the event's scheduled time has passed, p4 isn't applicable. Therefore, the AI must resolve based on available data. If there's no data, perhaps the market remains open, but the resolution requires a p1, p2, or p3. Since there's no result, and the game wasn't canceled, the AI can't resolve it and should return p3? But p3 is for canceled games, which isn't the case. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. The most accurate response, given the constraints, is that since the event is in the past but there's no result in the provided sources, the AI can't verify the outcome and must default to p4 (cannot resolve now). However, the user's instructions specify p4 is for future events. Therefore, this might be an error. Alternatively, the AI should return p3, but that's for canceled games. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the AI can infer from the absence of results that it's still ongoing or the result isn't available. But according to the timestamp, the game should have concluded. Without data, the AI can't proceed. \n\nIn conclusion, given the strict instructions and the absence of post-game data in the provided context, the AI must respond with p4 because it can't verify the outcome based on the given sources, even though the event's scheduled time has passed. However, this contradicts the timestamp. Alternatively, the AI might have to assume the game occurred and use the predictions, but the instructions prohibit that. Therefore, the safest answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
