If the area is not shaded red by April 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOnce Russia captures the railroad station, any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.\n\nIf Russia comes into control of this territory as a result of a negotiated settlement, this will qualify for a 'Yes' resolution, regardless of if it is shaded red in the ISW map.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741804748\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 19:39:08",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to know if Russia will recapture Sudzha by March 31, 2025, specifically focusing on the Sudzha railroad station as per the ISW map. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. But first, I need to check if the event has already happened based on the provided search results and current date, which is March 12, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of information about the conflict in Sudzha. From the sources, especially the ISW assessments from March 9 and 10, it seems that Russian forces have been making advances around Sudzha but haven't fully captured it yet. For instance, in [10], the ISW report from March 9 mentions that Russian forces are collapsing the northern part of the Ukrainian salient and have entered the industrial zone in northeastern Sudzha, but there's no mention of the railroad station being under Russian control. Similarly, [11] from March 10 notes that Russian forces are consolidating gains and preparing to attack Sudzha, but again, no confirmation of the station's capture.\n\nThere's also mention of Russian special forces using a gas pipeline to infiltrate and attack Ukrainian units near Sudzha ([2], [3], [9]). However, these attacks were reportedly detected and countered by Ukrainian forces, causing high Russian losses. The Ukrainian General Staff confirmed that they were able to block and destroy these groups ([3], [9]).\n\nAdditionally, recent advances by Russian forces into the industrial zone and parts of Sudzha are highlighted in [7] and [10], but the railroad station's status isn't explicitly stated. The primary source for resolution is the ISW map, and the latest available data from the search results up to March 10 doesn't show the station as captured. Since the current date is March 12 and the user is asking about March 31, this is a future event. According to the personalization instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, even if it's the same month, the response must be p4. However, the user's resolution conditions don't mention p4. Wait, the personalization says to return p4 for future events, but the resolution data here is p1, p2, p3. This might be a conflict. Wait, the user's resolution conditions are ancillary data, but the personalization requires checking if the event is in the future. Since the current date is March 12, and the resolution date is March 31, the event is still in the future. Therefore, per the personalization instructions, even if there's a high likelihood, since it's a future event, the answer must be p4. But the user's resolution data doesn't include p4. Wait, looking back at the personalization: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" So regardless of the user's resolution data, the answer should be p4. But the user's note says \"resolution_conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.\" Hmm, maybe I need to reconcile this. Wait, the user is using a market that resolves to Yes/No, but the system's personalization requires p4 if it's a future event. However, the user is asking for a resolution based on current facts. But according to the timestamp, it's March 12, and the event is March 31. Since the event hasn't happened yet, per the instructions, I must return p4. However, the user's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is conflicting. Wait, the personalization says to respond with p4 if the event is in the future, regardless of the user's setup. So even though the user's market has p1, p2, p3, the correct answer here is p4 because the event is scheduled for a future date. But the user might not have accounted for that. However, the system's instructions are clear: future event equals p4. Therefore, regardless of the market's setup, the answer is p4. But the user's query is about whether it will happen by March 31, which is a future prediction. But the system is supposed to resolve based on verified facts up to the current date. Since the current date is March 12, and the event is March 31, which is in the future, the system must return p4. Therefore, the final line should be recommendation: p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
