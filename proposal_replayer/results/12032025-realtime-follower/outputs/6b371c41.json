  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741830949\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 02:55:49",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how the UMA optimistic oracle should resolve a market based on the outcome of the Philadelphia 76ers vs. Toronto Raptors game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The key points here are verifying if the event occurred as scheduled and determining the winner to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time provided in the personalization section. The current timestamp is 1741830881, which converts to March 13, 2025, at 2:54:41 AM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 12 at 7:30 PM ET. Since ET is UTC-5 during March (assuming daylight saving time), 7:30 PM ET would be 12:30 AM UTC on March 13. The current time is 2:54 AM UTC on March 13, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the game should have already taken place.\n\nNext, I need to look at the search results provided to find out the outcome of the game. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Search Result [1]**: From ESPN, the game preview mentions the teams' records and some stats but doesn't provide the final score. However, at the bottom, there's a section that lists scores like \"76ers107\", \"Raptors115\", etc. This might be a typo or formatting issue, but it suggests the Raptors won 115-107. Also, the box score table shows Toronto at 22-43 and Philadelphia at 22-42, which aligns with the Raptors having one more loss, implying they won the game.\n\n2. **Search Result [3]**: Fox Sports' box score for March 12, 2025, game shows the Raptors as the home team. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the exact score isn't clear. However, the team stats might hint at the outcome based on performance.\n\n3. **Search Result [6]**: Covers.com's prediction article from March 12 mentions the Raptors' recent form and their chances against the 76ers, but doesn't state the result.\n\n4. **Search Result [7]**: Dimers.com's prediction from March 12 gives the Raptors a 65% chance to win, predicting a 112-108 victory. But this is a prediction, not the actual result.\n\n5. **Search Result [9]**: The Times of India preview mentions the game on March 12 but doesn't provide the result. However, it notes that the Raptors won their previous game against the Wizards, and the 76ers lost to the Hawks.\n\n6. **Search Result [10]**: Scores24.live's prediction from March 11 discusses the teams' motivations but doesn't have the actual result.\n\n7. **Search Result [11]**: Docsports.com's preview from March 12 also doesn't include the result, focusing on predictions and previous game stats.\n\n8. **Search Result [12]**: Action Network's page from March 12 lists the teams' records but doesn't show the score. The betting trends suggest the Raptors were favored.\n\nThe most concrete evidence comes from Search Result [1], which, despite being a preview, lists scores that imply the Raptors won 115-107. Additionally, the updated standings in the box score table show Toronto with 22 wins and 43 losses, while Philadelphia has 22 wins and 42 losses. Since a win would increase the Raptors' win count by one and the 76ers' loss count by one, this supports the Raptors having won the game.\n\nMoreover, the ancillary data in the query mentions that if the game happened, the market resolves based on the winner. Since the game was scheduled for a time before the current timestamp and the sources indicate the Raptors won, the resolution should be \"Raptors,\" corresponding to p1.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled, but none of the sources indicate that. All references are to the game occurring as planned. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Raptors).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
