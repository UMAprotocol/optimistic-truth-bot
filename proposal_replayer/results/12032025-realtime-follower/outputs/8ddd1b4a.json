  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741819912\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:51:52",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to resolve this query about the UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the La Salle vs. Massachusetts basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 4:30 PM ET. The current time is March 12, 2025, at 10:51:34 PM UTC. Wait, the game was supposed to be at 4:30 PM ET, which is 8:30 PM UTC. So the current time is about 2 hours and 20 minutes after the scheduled start. But I need to check if the game has already happened.\n\nLooking at the search results, the user provided several sources. Let me check each one. \n\nSearch result [1] is from January 19, 2025, about a previous game where UMass won. Not relevant to the current game.\n\nResult [2] is from March 11, 2025, announcing the upcoming A-10 tournament game between La Salle and UMass on March 12. It mentions the game will be nationally broadcast on USA Network and starts at 8:30 PM UTC (4:30 PM ET). The current time is after this, so the game should have already taken place. But the search results don't include any post-game articles. \n\nResults [3], [4], and [8] are about previous games between these teams in January and February 2025. Not relevant here.\n\nResult [6] is a prediction article from March 11, 2025, previewing the game on March 12. It mentions the game start time and odds but doesn't have the result.\n\nResults [11], [13], [14], and [15] are all prediction articles or betting odds pages for the March 12 game. They all predict the outcome but don't report the actual result. \n\nResult [12] also previews the game, noting that La Salle ended an eight-game losing streak in their last regular-season game. \n\nSince all the provided search results are from before the game's scheduled time and there's no post-game coverage, I have to conclude that the game is in the future relative to the user's current timestamp. Wait, the user's current time is March 12, 2025, 23:49:40 (UTC), which is 11:49 PM UTC. The game was at 4:30 PM ET (8:30 PM UTC). So the game should have occurred already. However, the absence of any post-game reports in the search results might mean that either the game hasn't been played yet, or the sources provided don't include the result. \n\nBut according to the user's instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. The current timestamp is March 12, 2025, 23:49:40 UTC. The game was scheduled for 8:30 PM UTC on the same day. Since the current time is after the scheduled start, the event has already passed. However, if there's no verifiable information about the outcome in the provided sources, can I confirm the result?\n\nThe user's personalization states that I must base the resolution strictly on verified facts from the sources provided. Since none of the search results include post-game information, I can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, even though the scheduled time has passed, without verified results, the event hasn't been resolved yet. \n\nWait, but the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is scheduled for a future date or time. But the event's scheduled time has passed. However, if the system doesn't have access to the result, it's considered unresolved. The instructions say to only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Since the sources don't include the result, even though the game was supposed to happen, the answer would be p4 because the result isn't verified. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was played but the sources provided don't reflect it, maybe due to a delay in reporting, but according to the rules, if there's no confirmation, it's still p4. The user's note says, \"If the search results are empty or unhelpful, answer the Query as well as you can with existing knowledge.\" But I can't use external knowledge, only the provided sources. Since all sources are pre-game, the event hasn't been resolved yet in the context of the provided data. Therefore, the correct response is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
