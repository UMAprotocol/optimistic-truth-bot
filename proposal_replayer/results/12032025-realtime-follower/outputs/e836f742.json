  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741810360\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 21:12:40",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Fordham vs. Rhode Island basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 2:00 PM ET. The market resolves to Fordham if they win, Rhode Island if they win, or 50-50 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current timestamp is March 12, 2025, 21:10:27 UTC, which is 8:10 PM Eastern Time. The game was scheduled for 2:00 PM ET the same day. So, the game should have already taken place. But wait, the user's current time is 8:12 PM UTC, which is 4:12 PM Eastern. Wait, no, UTC is 4 hours ahead of Eastern Time in March. So March 12, 21:10:27 UTC is 5:10 PM Eastern Time. The game was at 2 PM ET, so it should have occurred by now. But the search results include sources up to March 12, like [5] which mentions the final score of 86-67 from the regular season game on March 8, and [8] and [9] from ESPN showing a live score for the March 12 game with partial scores. However, [10] is a prediction article from March 11, and [12] is a preview from March 11. \n\nLooking at the search results, [4] is a box score from March 12, 2025, showing the game between Fordham and Rhode Island. The URI odds are listed, but the actual game data isn't fully shown. [8] and [9] are ESPN pages with live scores, but the scores shown are incomplete (e.g., in [8], the score is 16-16 in the first half, which doesn't make sense). [10] is a prediction article from March 11, so it's before the game. [12] is a preview article from March 11, mentioning the upcoming game. \n\nWait, there's a conflict here. The user's current time is March 12, 2025, 21:10:27 UTC (5:10 PM ET), and the game was at 2 PM ET. So the game should have concluded. However, the search results don't include a conclusive post-game report. The latest result is [5], which is from March 12, but it's about the regular-season game on March 8. [4] is a box score from March 12, but the data there seems to be from the previous game on March 8. The Fox Sports link [4] shows the previous games for both teams, with URI's last game being a win against Fordham on March 8. The ESPN links [8] and [9] might be live scores, but they don't show a final result. \n\nWait, looking at [5], the article titled \"Rams conclude regular season with wire-to-wire win\" is from March 12, but it's about the March 8 game. The article says both teams are set to rematch on Wednesday (March 12). So the actual tournament game on March 12 hasn't been reported in the provided search results. The only post-March 8 info is the previews and predictions. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no conclusive evidence that the March 12 game has been played and concluded. The current time is after the scheduled game time, but the available sources don't confirm the outcome. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But here, the event's scheduled time (2 PM ET on March 12) has passed, but the sources don't show the result. However, the user's system might not have access to real-time data beyond the provided search results. \n\nSince the search results don't include a final score for the March 12 game, and the latest info is from previews and predictions, the resolution can't be determined from the given data. The user's instructions say to resolve based on verified facts. If the game occurred but isn't reported in the sources, we can't assume the outcome. However, the timestamp is after the game, so perhaps the game was played, but the results aren't in the provided context. \n\nIn this case, since the provided search results don't include the outcome of the March 12 game, and the user's instructions require resolution based solely on verified facts from the sources, we can't confirm the result. Therefore, the market should resolve to p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). But wait, the user's current time is March 12, 2025, 21:10:27 UTC (5:10 PM ET), which is after the game's scheduled time. However, if the game was played but not reported in the sources, we can't assume it was canceled. The user's instructions state that if the event is in the future, return p4. But the event's time has passed. However, without verified results in the sources, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the answer should be p4 because the sources don't provide the result, even though the game's scheduled time has passed. The user's system might not have access to real-time data beyond the provided context.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
