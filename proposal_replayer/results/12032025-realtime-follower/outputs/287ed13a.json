  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741842897\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 06:14:57",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Montreal Canadiens vs. Seattle Kraken game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on which team wins. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 6:13 AM UTC, which is March 13 at 2:13 AM ET. So the game was supposed to happen on March 12 at 10:30 PM ET, which is March 13 at 3:30 AM UTC. The current time is 6:13 AM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already occurred. The user provided several search results. Let's look through them. \n\nSearch result [9] from Plain Text Sports shows the game ended in overtime with Seattle winning 5-4. The data was loaded at 1:13 AM ET, which is after the game's scheduled time. This seems like a live update or post-game report. \n\nSearch result [11] from ESPN's live score mentions the game with a live score, but the details show the Kraken leading 2-1 in the second period. However, the timestamp isn't clear here. \n\nSearch result [13] from CBS Sports has live updates from March 12, 2025, mentioning the Canadiens' recent win against Vancouver and the Kraken's loss to Washington. But this might be pre-game analysis. \n\nWait, looking at result [9] again, it clearly states the final score as 5-4 in overtime for the Kraken. The data was loaded at 1:13 AM ET on March 13, which is after the game's scheduled end time. This indicates the game was completed. \n\nAdditionally, search result [1] initially lists the game as March 12 at 7:30 PM, but another entry in the same result shows March 13, 2:30 AM KHN time, which might be a time zone discrepancy. However, the key is result [9] showing the final score. \n\nTherefore, the game did take place, and the Kraken won in overtime. According to the resolution conditions, if the Kraken won, the market resolves to \"Kraken\" (p1). Since the game was not postponed or canceled, and there's a clear result, the answer should be p1. \n\nI need to confirm that all sources are reliable. ESPN and Plain Text Sports are credible for game scores. The other sources like Dimers and Action Network have predictions, but [9] provides the actual outcome. \n\nSo, the resolution should be p1: Kraken.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
