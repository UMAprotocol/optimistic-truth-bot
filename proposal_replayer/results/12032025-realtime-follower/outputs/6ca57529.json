  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741833585\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 03:39:45",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for a CBB game between Coppin State and SC State scheduled for March 12 at 8:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for SC State, p2 for Coppin State, and p3 if the game is canceled. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, which is the day after the game was supposed to happen. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually occurred on March 12. Since the current date is March 13, the event's scheduled time has passed. Now, I need to verify the outcome. The user provided a URL, so I should check that source for the result. If the source confirms the game's result, I can resolve accordingly. If the source says the game was postponed or canceled, then I need to determine if it's rescheduled or canceled entirely.\n\nLooking at the ancillary data, the market resolves to Coppin State if they win, SC State if they win, 50-50 if canceled. The resolution_conditions map p1 to SC State, p2 to Coppin State, p3 to 50-50. The user's personalization instructs to use the provided URL heavily. Since the current time is after the event, if the game happened, check the result. If not, check if it's postponed or canceled.\n\nAssuming the provided URL (which I can't access directly) has the information, I need to base my answer on that. If the URL reports that the game was played and, say, Coppin State won, then the resolution is p2. If SC State won, p1. If the game was postponed, the market remains open. But if it's canceled without a makeup, then p3.\n\nBut since the current date is March 13, and the game was scheduled for March 12, if there's no report of a postponement or cancellation, and the game was played, then the result should be available. If the source shows the result, resolve accordingly. If the source indicates the game was canceled, then p3. If postponed, the market stays open, but according to the resolution conditions, if postponed, it remains open until completed. However, the user's current time is March 13, so if the game was postponed to a later date after March 13, but the market hasn't resolved yet, but the oracle's job is to resolve based on the current timestamp. Wait, the market rules say if postponed, it remains open until completed. But the oracle needs to resolve based on the current state. Since the current time is after the scheduled date, if the game was postponed but not yet played, the market is still open, so the oracle can't resolve it yet. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But in this case, the event was scheduled for March 12, which is in the past. So if the game was postponed to a future date (after March 13), then it's a future event, and the oracle should return p4. But according to the market's rules, if postponed, the market remains open. However, the oracle's instructions say to return p4 only if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since the original date was March 12, which has passed, but if the game was postponed to a later date, then the event is now scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp (March 13), so the oracle should return p4. If the game was canceled entirely, then p3. If the game was played and completed, then resolve based on the winner.\n\nSo, the key steps are: 1. Check the provided URL for the game's outcome. 2. Determine if the game was played, postponed, or canceled. 3. If played, resolve p1 or p2. If canceled, p3. If postponed (now a future event), p4.\n\nGiven that the user provided a URL, I must rely on that. Assuming the URL reports the game was played and SC State won, then the answer is p1. If Coppin State won, p2. If the URL says the game was canceled, p3. If postponed to a future date, p4. Since the current time is after the original schedule, but the resolution depends on the actual outcome as per the source.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
