  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741819352\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:42:32",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to resolve this UMA optimistic oracle request based on the user's query about the Texas vs. Vanderbilt game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET. Let me start by checking the current date and time given in the personalization section. The current timestamp is 1741819278, which translates to March 12, 2025, at 23:41:18 UTC. That's 10:42 PM UTC, which is 5:42 PM ET. So the game was scheduled for 3:30 PM ET on March 12, which has already passed by the current time. \n\nNext, I need to verify if the game actually took place and determine the outcome using the provided search results. Let's look through the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] is a live game thread from 247sports.com titled \"Texas MBB Live Game Thread: SEC Tournament First Round vs Vanderbilt\" dated March 12, 2025. The detailed account mentions that Texas won 79-72 against Vanderbilt. It describes the game's progression, key players, and stats, confirming the game occurred and Texas was victorious.\n\nSearch result [5] from CBS Sports also previews the game, stating it's a first-round SEC tournament matchup. However, the key info is in [1], which gives the final score. \n\nSearch result [6] from wtop.com provides pre-game details, but [8] from Fox Sports includes the box score and confirms Texas won. Additionally, search result [8] lists the final score and key player stats, aligning with [1]'s report.\n\nThe other search results [2], [3], [4], [7] don't pertain to the game's outcome. [2] discusses a previous A&M vs. Vanderbilt game, [3] is about a football game rumor, [4] and [7] are unrelated academic papers.\n\nSince all relevant sources confirm the game was played on March 12, 2025, and Texas won 79-72, the market should resolve to Texas. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p2 (Texas) is the correct resolution.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
