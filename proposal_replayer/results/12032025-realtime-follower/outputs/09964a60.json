  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741816342\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 22:52:22",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the query. The user wants to resolve a market asking whether Club Brugge or Aston Villa will advance to the next round of the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. The current date is March 12, 2025, and the second leg is scheduled for today. The first leg ended 3-1 in favor of Aston Villa. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The second leg is on March 12, which is today. The current timestamp is 22:51:04 (10:51 PM UTC), and the match is at 21:00 CET (which is 8 PM UTC). Since the current time is past 8 PM UTC, the match should have already taken place. However, looking at the search results provided, the latest information is from the first leg on March 4 and previews for the second leg. There are no search results indicating the outcome of the second leg. \n\nWait, the search results include URLs from March 11 and March 12, but they are previews or predictions. For example, result [4] is a preview from March 11, and [8] is from March 11, discussing the upcoming match. None of the search results provide the actual result of the second leg. Since the user's current time is March 12, 2025, 22:51:04, which is after the match's scheduled time, but there's no data here about the match result. \n\nAccording to the personalization instructions, if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, we should return p4. But here, the event's scheduled time has passed. However, the provided search results don't include the second leg's outcome. Since the resolution source must be official UEFA information, and the context provided doesn't include the actual result, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, even though the match was supposed to have happened, without verified results, we can't resolve it. Wait, but the user's timestamp is March 12, 2025, 22:51:04, which is after the match time. However, the provided search results don't include the second leg's result. Since we must base the answer strictly on verified facts from the provided sources, and the sources don't have the second leg result, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the event hasn't been resolved in the provided context. Hence, the answer should be p4 because the resolution data isn't available in the search results provided. But wait, the user's current time is after the match, but the sources don't show the result. Since the system can't access real-time data beyond what's provided, we have to rely on the given context. Since the context doesn't include the result of the March 12 match, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the event hasn't occurred yet in the context provided, so we return p4.\n\nAnother angle: The query is about whether Club Brugge or Aston Villa advance. The first leg was 3-1 to Aston Villa. The second leg is required to determine the aggregate. Since the second leg's result isn't in the search results, even though the current time is after the match, the lack of data means we can't verify the outcome. Therefore, we can't resolve it and must return p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
