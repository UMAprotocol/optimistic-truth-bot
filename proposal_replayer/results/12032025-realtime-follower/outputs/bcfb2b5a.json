  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741831376\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 03:02:56",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding what the user is asking. They want me to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Boston Celtics game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Celtics win, p2 for Thunder win, and p3 if the game is canceled. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 03:01:50, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as planned. The user provided several search results. Looking at result [6], which is from ESPN, the live score page shows that the game is labeled as \"LIVE\" with the Thunder leading. However, the current time is March 13, 2025, 03:01:50, which is past the game's scheduled time. This might mean the game was in progress when the page was last updated but hasn't concluded yet. Wait, but the user's current time is after the game should have ended. Let me check other sources.\n\nResult [1] mentions the game on March 12 was the second matchup, and the Thunder won the first. The detailed stats in [6] show player stats for the Celtics and Thunder, indicating the game was played. However, the ESPN page might not have the final score updated yet. Result [5] from April 2024 talks about a Celtics win, but that's from the previous season, so it's irrelevant here. \n\nResult [4] from Wikihoops has a detailed box score for the March 12, 2025 game. The Thunder's record is listed as 51-11, and the Celtics as 45-18. The comments section might have more info, but the content isn't fully visible. Result [7] provides championship odds updated on March 12, 2025, which might imply the game's outcome affects these odds, but it doesn't state the result directly.\n\nWait, result [6] shows the Thunder leading 98-92 with 5:23 left in the game. But the current time is after the game should have ended. Since the user's current time is March 13, 2025, 03:01:50, which is 3 AM UTC on the 13th, and the game was on March 12 at 7:30 PM ET (which is 00:30 UTC on the 13th), the game should have concluded. However, the ESPN live score hasn't been updated to a final result. This could be a delay in updating the page. \n\nLooking at result [1], the article from March 13, 2025, discusses the game on March 12 as the second matchup. It mentions that the Thunder won the first game 105-92. The second game's summary isn't fully provided, but the article's existence suggests the game took place. However, without explicit confirmation of the final result, I need to be cautious. \n\nResult [8] from CBS Sports mentions the game as part of a potential Finals preview and notes the Thunder's recent loss to Denver. But again, no final score. \n\nSince all sources either discuss the game as upcoming or in-progress but don't provide a conclusive result, and considering the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, I need to determine if there's any confirmation of the outcome. If the sources don't explicitly state the result, I can't assume it. However, result [6] shows live stats with the Thunder leading, but it's unclear if that's the final. \n\nGiven that the user's current time is after the game, but the search results don't provide a definitive conclusion, I should check if the event was postponed or canceled. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation in the provided results. All sources refer to the game as happening on March 12. Therefore, the game likely took place, but without a clear result in the provided context, I can't confirm the winner. However, the user's instructions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But here, the event's scheduled time is before the current timestamp. \n\nWait, the game was scheduled for March 12 at 7:30 PM ET, which is March 13, 00:30 UTC. The current timestamp is March 13, 03:01:50 UTC, so the game should have concluded. However, the search results don't have a final score. Result [6] shows live stats, but it's possible the data isn't updated. Without a confirmed result from the sources, I might have to consider that the information is unavailable, leading to p3. But according to the user's personalization, if the event has occurred but there's no verifiable information, perhaps it's p3. However, the user's instructions say to use p4 only if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past, but no result is found, maybe p3. But the user's instructions state to use p4 only for future events. If the event has passed but there's no data, it's unclear. However, the user's example says if the event is on the same day but later time, it's p4. Here, the event was scheduled for a time that has already passed. Therefore, if the game occurred but the result isn't verifiable through provided sources, perhaps it's p3. However, the user's instructions say if the event hasn't occurred yet, use p4. Since the event has occurred, but the result isn't found, the resolution should be based on available data. \n\nWait, in the search results, [6] shows the game in progress with 5:23 left, but the current time is after the game. If the sources don't provide the final result, but the game was played, perhaps it's resolved based on available data. However, without a final score, it's impossible to confirm. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if the event is in the past but no verifiable result exists, maybe it's p3. However, the user's personalization says to return p4 only for future events. Since the event is in the past, even if the result isn't found, it's not p4. The instructions state: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4\". Since the event has occurred, even if the result isn't found, it's not p4. Therefore, the resolution should be based on available info. \n\nBut the user's instructions also say: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it.\" The user provided URLs, but none of them conclusively show the final result. The ESPN page [6] is a live score but doesn't show the final. The other sources either preview the game or discuss past seasons. Therefore, the available data doesn't confirm the result. According to the resolution conditions, if the game is canceled, it's p3. Since there's no info on cancellation, but the game was played, but no result, perhaps it's unresolved. However, the user's instructions require using the provided sources. If the sources don't confirm the result, the answer should be p3. But I need to check again. \n\nWait, result [1] from sportskeeda.com mentions the game on March 12 as the second matchup. The first paragraph says \"The Boston Celtics vs OKC Thunder duel on March 12 was the second and final matchup...\" and later in the game summary, it mentions the Thunder leading at halftime. But the article doesn't provide the final score. Similarly, result [4] from wikihoops has a box score but the data seems to be pre-game stats (showing records before the game). Result [6] shows live stats but not the final. \n\nGiven that the user's current time is after the game, but none of the provided sources give the final result, I can't verify the outcome. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if the event has occurred but there's no verifiable information, it's p3. However, the user's personalization says to return p4 only if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past, but no result is found, it's p3. However, the user might have intended that if the result isn't found, but the event occurred, it's p3. But the instructions also say to check if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since it's not, but the result is unknown, perhaps resolve to p3. But the user's example says if the event is in the future, use p4. Here, the event is in the past, so p4 isn't applicable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the Thunder won based on [1] which says the Thunder won the first matchup and the second game's details are discussed but without a final score. However, that's speculative. Without explicit confirmation, I can't assume. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3 (unknown/50-50) because the result isn't verifiable through the provided sources. But the user's instructions say to use p4 only for future events. Since the event is past, and the result isn't found, perhaps p3. \n\nWait, but the user's current time is March 13, 2025, 03:01:50, which is after the game's scheduled time. The game should have concluded. If the sources don't provide the result, but the event occurred, the resolution should be based on available data. However, without any sources confirming the result, the answer is p3. However, the user's instructions state to answer based strictly on verified facts. If there's no verified result, then it's p3. But the user's example says to use p4 only for future events. Since this event is in the past, but no result is found, p3 is appropriate. However, the user might have intended that if the result is not found, but the event has occurred, it's p3. Therefore, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",
