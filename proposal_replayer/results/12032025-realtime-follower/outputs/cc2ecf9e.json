  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741819277\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:41:17",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. Wait, no, actually, the query says it's Donald Trump's press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin. The market resolves based on whether Trump uses those terms during the event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 1741819131, which translates to March 12, 2025, 23:38:51 UTC. The press conference in question is scheduled for 5 PM ET on the same day. Since 5 PM ET is 22:00 UTC, the event has already occurred by the current time (23:38 UTC). So the event is in the past, and I need to verify whether Trump said \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during that press conference.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, most of them relate to Trump's meeting with the Irish Prime Minister. Let's go through each relevant source.\n\nSearch result [1] mentions Trump's meeting with Martin, discussing trade and tariffs, but no mention of AI. Similarly, [3] is a YouTube video of Trump hosting Martin, but the transcript snippets don't include AI. \n\nResult [2] discusses Trump's executive order on AI from January 2025, but that's a different event. Result [10] is a transcript of Trump announcing the Stargate AI project in January 2025, but again, not the March 12 press conference. \n\nResult [5] and [15] mention discussions about Ukraine and Gaza, but not AI. Result [7] and [14] focus on trade issues and tariffs. \n\nResult [11] is a video of Trump and Martin's meeting. The transcript includes Trump talking about pharmaceutical companies, the EU, and tariffs. There's a mention of \"productivity\" and other topics but no \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence.\" \n\nResult [16] is about the St. Patrick's Day celebration, again no AI mentioned. \n\nThe key sources here are the actual transcripts or reports from the March 12 press conference. From the available data, none of the search results indicate that Trump used the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his press conference with Martin. All mentions of AI in the search results are from earlier events or unrelated contexts. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, Trump did not say \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during the specified press conference. The resolution should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1. However, the resolution conditions state p2 is Yes and p1 is No. Wait, the resolution_conditions are res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. So if the answer is No, it's p1. \n\nBut I need to make sure there's no mention in any of the sources. Checking all again: search result [6] mentions Vance talking about technology and AI, but that's during a breakfast meeting, which the query specifies the press conference. The query says preceding bilateral meetings don't count. Only the press conference itself. Since none of the press conference transcripts include AI, the answer is No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
