  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742297830 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:37:10 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jon Gruden will be announced as an NFL head coach for the 2025-26 season by March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on official announcements or credible reports by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's March 18, 2025, which is after the March 12 deadline. So any announcements after March 12 wouldn't count. But the search results don't mention any official announcements of Gruden being hired by an NFL team as head coach. \n\nLooking at the sources, there's a lot of speculation. Sources [1], [3], [4], [6], [9], and [14] mention that Gruden is considered a hot candidate, with teams doing homework on him. However, source [11] from January 12, 2025, states that his name hasn't emerged in the hiring cycle yet, and there are no reports linking him to any team. Source [13] argues against him being a fit for the Bears. \n\nThe key point is the deadline: March 12. Even if teams were interested, if there's no official announcement or credible reporting confirming his hiring by that date, the answer should be \"No\". The latest info from [11] suggests no connections had been made public by early January, and there's no mention of any hires by March 12. \n\nAdditionally, source [9] from January 8 predicts he'll join the Saints, but it's labeled as a prediction, not a report. Without official confirmation, that doesn't count. \n\nSince the deadline has passed and there's no evidence of an announcement or credible report by March 12, the resolution should be \"No\". Therefore, p1 corresponds to No.\n</think>\n\nJon Gruden has not been officially announced as an NFL head coach for the 2025-26 season as of the resolution deadline of March 12, 2025. While multiple reports indicated interest from teams like the Saints, Bears, and Jets during the 2025 hiring cycle ([1][3][4][6][14]), no credible confirmation of a hiring emerged by the cutoff date. NFL Network's Tom Pelissero noted Gruden\u2019s potential candidacy but emphasized that no formal interviews or connections materialized publicly ([11][13]). The absence of official announcements or consensus reporting by the deadline necessitates resolution to \"No.\"\n\nrecommendation: p1",
