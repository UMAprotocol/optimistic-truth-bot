  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742297086 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-18 11:24:46 UTC",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the South Carolina vs. Arkansas CBB game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if South Carolina wins, it resolves to p2; if Arkansas wins, p1; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, resolves 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date given is March 18, 2025, so the game was supposed to happen on March 12, which is in the past. Now, looking at the search results to determine the outcome. \n\nSearch result [1] is a prediction from Dimers.com, dated March 12, 2025, predicting Arkansas has a 52% chance. But predictions aren't outcomes. \n\nResult [2] is an article from March 1, 2025, detailing a previous game where Arkansas lost to South Carolina 72-53. But that's a different game, not the March 12 one. \n\nResult [4] is a preview for the March 12 game, mentioning South Carolina's record and their previous win over Arkansas. But again, it's a preview, not the result.\n\nResult [5] and [6] are betting previews for the March 12 game, with odds favoring Arkansas. Still, no outcome reported. \n\nResult [7] and [8] are previews and updates but don't mention the game's result. \n\nThe other results discuss prediction markets and betting rules but don't provide the game's outcome. \n\nSince all the provided sources are either previews, predictions, or unrelated, there's no verifiable information confirming the actual result of the March 12 game. The user's instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. The ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3, but there's no mention of cancellation. However, without any sources reporting the actual result, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4, as per the instructions when the outcome isn't verifiable.\n</think>\n\nThe South Carolina vs. Arkansas CBB game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET has a past date relative to the current timestamp (March 18, 2025). However, **no verifiable information about the game's outcome exists in the provided search results**. The sources include pre-game predictions, betting odds, and coverage of a previous March 1, 2025 matchup between these teams[1][2][4][5][6][7][8], but none confirm the March 12 game\u2019s result.  \n\nThe ancillary data specifies resolving to p1 (Arkansas), p2 (South Carolina), or p3 (50-50 for cancellation). Since the event date has passed but no outcome is documented, and the user prompt does not indicate postponement or cancellation, the resolution defaults to **p4** under the UMA oracle protocol.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",
