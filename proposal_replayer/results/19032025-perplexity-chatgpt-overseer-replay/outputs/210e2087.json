Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Wyoming vs. San Jos\u00e9 State CBB game on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if San Jos\u00e9 State wins, it's p1; Wyoming wins, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 12, 2025, which is the same day as the current timestamp provided (March 19, 2025). Wait, no, the current date in the personalization section is March 19, 2025, so the game date is in the past. That means the event has already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially [1], [6], and [8], they all report that San Jos\u00e9 State won the game 66-61. The detailed articles mention the score, key players, and how the game unfolded. For example, [1] states that Wyoming lost 66-61 in the Mountain West Tournament opener. [6] provides the box score with the final score of 66-61 in favor of San Jos\u00e9 State. [8] also confirms the win by San Jos\u00e9 State. \n\nI need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the outcome is clear: San Jos\u00e9 State won. According to the resolution conditions, a San Jos\u00e9 State victory corresponds to p1. \n\nNo conflicting information in the sources. All relevant results confirm the result. So the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Wyoming vs. San Jos\u00e9 State men's basketball game occurred on March 12, 2025, as scheduled. San Jos\u00e9 State defeated Wyoming 66-61 in the Mountain West Tournament First Round at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas[1][6][8]. The Spartans built a 22-point first-half lead and held off a late Wyoming comeback attempt, securing their third win over the Cowboys during the 2024-25 season[1][4][8].  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- Final score: San Jos\u00e9 State 66, Wyoming 61[1][6]  \n- San Jos\u00e9 State led wire-to-wire after starting with a 12-0 run[8]  \n- Wyoming shot 10.5% from three-point range (2/19)[1]  \n- This marked San Jos\u00e9 State's third victory over Wyoming in the season series[1][4]  \n\nSince the game concluded without postponement or cancellation, and San Jos\u00e9 State won decisively, the market resolves accordingly.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
