The resolution depends on credible reporting. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any announcements or credible reports about the invitation. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] from February 25, 2025, mentions Trump saying he will invite them and that the invitation was sent the same day. \n- Source [2] on March 10 confirms the Eagles accepted the invitation, and they're working on the date.\n- Source [3] from February 26 states Trump said the invitation is imminent and would be sent that day.\n- Source [4] also from February 26 reports Trump's announcement to invite them, with the team expected to accept.\n- Source [5] from February 26 again confirms Trump's statement about sending the invitation.\n- Source [6] on March 11 mentions a date set for April 28, indicating the invitation was sent and accepted.\n- Sources [7] to [13] all corroborate that the invitation was sent and accepted, with a confirmed visit date in April.\n\nAll credible sources agree that Trump extended the invitation before March 31. The Eagles accepted, and a date was set. There's no conflicting information suggesting the invitation wasn't sent by the deadline. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump extended an invitation to the Philadelphia Eagles to visit the White House following their Super Bowl LIX victory, with multiple credible sources confirming the invitation was issued by February 25, 2025[1][3][4][5][8]. The Eagles organization \"enthusiastically accepted\" the invitation[2][6][7][9][10][12], and a specific visit date was later confirmed for April 28, 2025[6][9][10][12]. This fulfills the market's resolution condition requiring an invitation by March 31, 2025. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
