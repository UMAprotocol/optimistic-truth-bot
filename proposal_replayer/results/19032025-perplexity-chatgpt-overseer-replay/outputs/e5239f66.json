The ancillary data specifies that if the Clippers win, it's p2 (Clippers), if the Heat win, p1 (Heat), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game on March 12, 2025. Source [1] is a recap of the game, clearly stating the Clippers won 119-104. That's a direct confirmation. \n\nLooking at other sources, [2] and [6] are predictions before the game, but [5] is a highlight video titled with the same date, showing the game occurred. Source [7] from January 13 mentions the Clippers resuming their schedule and hosting the Heat, but the game in question here is March 12, which isn't related to the fires mentioned in [3] and [7]. \n\nThe key point is the actual result. Source [1] provides detailed stats: James Harden with 24 points, Bogdanovic with 30, and the final score. The Heat's losing streak is noted, confirming the Clippers' victory. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to p2 (Clippers) as they won the game. All checks confirm the game was played, and the outcome is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Miami Heat 119-104 in their March 12, 2025 NBA regular season matchup[1][5]. Key contributors included James Harden (24 points, 11 assists), Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107 (30 points, 10 rebounds), and Ivica Zubac (26 points, 14 rebounds)[1]. The Clippers maintained control throughout the game, leading by 10 points after the first quarter and extending their advantage to 92-84 through three quarters before closing out the win[1][5].\n\nThis result occurred despite:\n- The Clippers missing Kawhi Leonard (rest) and coach Tyronn Lue (back pain)[1]\n- Miami suffering its fifth straight loss, a season-worst streak[1]\n- Pre-game predictions favoring Miami's home court advantage[2][6]\n\nThe game was played as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation mentioned in any verified sources[1][5][7]. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome:\n\nrecommendation: p2",
