        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Saint Patrick\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the exact term \"Saint Patrick\". The ancillary data specifies that the term must be spoken during the scheduled event, which was the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. \n\nLooking through the sources, several transcripts and articles mention Trump's remarks. In source [3], the transcript of the St. Patrick's Day Reception includes Trump saying, \"I want to be the first to wish each and every one of you a very happy St. Patrick's Day.\" Here, he uses \"St. Patrick's Day,\" which includes the term \"Saint Patrick\" in possessive form. The resolution conditions state that possessive forms count, so this should qualify. \n\nAdditionally, source [10] quotes Trump referring to \"Saint Patrick's Cathedral\" and mistakenly calling him the \"patriot saint,\" but this was during the same event. Even though he misspoke, the term \"Saint Patrick\" was used. \n\nHowever, the user's update specifies the resolution is based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception. The key point is whether \"Saint Patrick\" was uttered. The possessive \"St. Patrick's\" in \"St. Patrick's Day\" does count per the rules. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nDuring the St. Patrick's Day Reception with Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025, President Donald Trump explicitly referenced \"St. Patrick's Day\" multiple times in his remarks[3][10][12], using the possessive form of the term. The resolution conditions specify that possessive forms (e.g., \"Saint Patrick's\") qualify as valid instances[ancillary_data].\n\nA review of the event's transcript shows Trump stated:  \n*\"I want to be the first to wish each and every one of you a very happy **St. Patrick's Day**\"*[3][12], directly invoking the saint's name in the context of the celebration. While Trump later mistakenly referred to \"patriot saint\" in a separate remark about Saint Patrick's Cathedral[9][18], the possessive usage of \"St. Patrick's\" during the official reception meets the resolution criteria[ancillary_data].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment with the facts of the event.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception with the Taoiseach of Ireland on March 12, 2025. It correctly notes that the term \"Saint Patrick\" in any form, including possessive, counts towards the resolution of the market. The response uses sources that mention Donald Trump referring to \"St. Patrick's Day\" and \"Saint Patrick's Cathedral,\" which are in line with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the information from the sources, linking Trump's use of \"St. Patrick's\" directly to the resolution conditions that count possessive forms of the term. It provides a thorough explanation of how the terms used by Trump during the event meet the criteria for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and that the terms used by Trump during the event align with the resolution conditions. The recommendation of p2 (Yes) is based on concrete evidence from the event's transcript and is consistent with the ancillary data provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the terms used during the event and does not stray into irrelevant details or assumptions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It adheres closely to the user prompt and system prompt instructions, provides a logically sound analysis based on verified facts, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the use of the term 'Saint Patrick' in the possessive form during the event, aligning with the resolution conditions. It provides a well-reasoned and fact-based recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm the occurrence of the event and the terms used, adhering closely to the resolution conditions without any factual errors or logical inconsistencies.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742558223 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-21 11:57:03 UTC",
