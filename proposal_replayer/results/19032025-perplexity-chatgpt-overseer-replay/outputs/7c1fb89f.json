        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the St. Francis (PA) vs. Alabama State game. The ancillary data specifies that if Alabama State wins, it's p1; St. Francis, p2; postponed stays open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the game's date and time. The query says March 18 at 6:40 PM ET. The current timestamp given is March 19, 2025, 4:40 PM UTC. Wait, March 19 UTC is the same day as March 18 ET because of the time difference. But looking at the search results, all the articles are dated March 19, 2025, which might be after the game. Let me confirm. The game was played on March 18, as per the query, and the articles from March 19 report the result. So the game has already occurred.\n\nNext, check the outcome. All the search results mention Alabama State winning 70-68. For example, result [1] says Knox's last-second layup gave Alabama State the win. Results [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], and [8] all confirm the same score and outcome. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the game was played and Alabama State won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information in the sources. All sources agree on the result. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nAmarr Knox's last-second layup secured Alabama State's 70-68 victory over Saint Francis (PA) in the NCAA First Four game on March 18, 2025. The decisive play occurred with one second remaining when Micah Simpson threw a full-court pass that deflected to Knox for the game-winning basket[1][3][7]. This marked Alabama State's first NCAA Tournament win in program history[6][7], advancing them to face Auburn in the South Region[1][3].\n\nKey details:\n- **Final score**: Alabama State 70, Saint Francis 68  \n- **Game context**: Saint Francis led by nine in the first half and shot 59% before halftime[1][2], but committed 15 turnovers leading to 26 Alabama State points[4][5].  \n- **Clutch plays**: Chris Moncrief tied the game at 68 with a three-pointer at 0:40 remaining[1][3], setting up Knox's dramatic buzzer-beater[7][8].  \n\nThe game concluded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome:  \nrecommendation: p1",
