        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Seattle Kraken vs. Chicago Blackhawks game on March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kraken win, it's p2; if the Blackhawks win, p1; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET. The current timestamp given is March 19, 2025, 4:41 PM UTC, which is the same day in ET (UTC-4 or -5 depending on daylight saving). Wait, March 19 UTC would be March 18 in ET. Let me confirm time zones. March 19, 2025, 16:40 UTC is equivalent to March 19, 12:40 PM ET. But the game was on March 18 at 8:30 PM ET. So the game date is in the past relative to the current timestamp. That means the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome. Looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 3, 10, 12) report that the Seattle Kraken won 6-2 against the Chicago Blackhawks. For example, source [1] states, \"Shane Wright scores 2, Adam Larsson has goal and assist as Kraken beat Blackhawks 6-2.\" Similarly, source [12] mentions the Kraken scoring six unanswered goals. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources confirm the game took place as scheduled with a Kraken victory. The resolution conditions state a Kraken win resolves to p2. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Seattle Kraken defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 6-2 in their NHL game on March 18, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the Kraken overcame an early 2-0 deficit with six unanswered goals, including two from Shane Wright and contributions from Adam Larsson (1 goal, 2 assists) and Matty Beniers (1 goal, 1 assist)[1][2][10][12]. The outcome meets the resolution condition specifying a Kraken win. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
