        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"God\" two or more times during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes if he did, p1 for No if not, and p3 if uncertain. The updates mention the event is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Trump saying \"God\" during that specific event. Let's look through the sources provided.\n\nLooking at source [1], it's a transcript of Trump's meeting with the Irish PM. He talks about various topics like tariffs, Rosie O'Donnell, and Conor McGregor. No mention of \"God\" here.\n\nSource [2] discusses the same meeting, focusing on trade issues. Again, no reference to Trump using the word \"God.\"\n\nSource [4] is a video of Trump's St. Patrick's Day reception speech. The transcript snippet includes him talking about St. Patrick's Church and mentions \"faith in God\" when describing the parishioners defending the church. That's one instance.\n\nSource [16] is another transcript from the St. Patrick's Day reception. Trump mentions \"faith in God\" again in the same context as source [4]. That's a second instance.\n\nSource [17] is another video of the same reception. The transcript part shown includes Trump repeating the story about the church and \"faith in God,\" which would be the same two mentions.\n\nOther sources like [3], [5], [9], [10], [11], [12] discuss Trump's religious references in other contexts but not during the specific event in question.\n\nWait, in source [16], the transcript shows Trump saying: \"they had was faith in God they had a big faith in God.\" That's two mentions of \"God\" in the same sentence. So that's two instances right there.\n\nTherefore, during the St. Patrick's Day Reception, Trump used the word \"God\" at least twice. The resolution should be p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nPresident Trump mentioned \"God\" twice during the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Reception with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. In his remarks, he recounted the story of Irish parishioners defending St. Patrick\u2019s Church during a fire, stating they had \"faith in God\" and \"a big faith in God\" [4][16][17]. Both instances occurred within the same narrative about historical Irish resilience, meeting the threshold of two required uses.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The AI correctly notes that the resolution should be based on whether Donald Trump mentioned the word \"God\" two or more times during this specific event. The response identifies two instances where Trump used the word \"God\" in the context of discussing \"faith in God\" during the reception. This part of the analysis adheres to the user prompt's requirement for any usage of the term, regardless of context.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a thorough search through multiple sources to confirm the instances of the word \"God\" being mentioned. It correctly concludes that Trump mentioned \"God\" twice, which aligns with the resolution condition p2 for \"Yes.\" The logical flow from the evidence to the conclusion is clear and well-supported by the sources cited.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and that the term \"God\" was mentioned at least twice. This aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The critical oversight in the response is the confusion between the St. Patrick's Day Reception and the press conference with the Irish Prime Minister. The user prompt specifies that the market is about the press conference, not the reception. This distinction is crucial because the resolution conditions and the event's context differ. The response, therefore, resolves based on the wrong event, leading to a potentially incorrect resolution.\n\nGiven this analysis, the response needs improvement due to the misalignment of the event context (reception vs. press conference).

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"God\" two or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact event in question. The user mentioned a press conference, but there's an update that the resolution is based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. So I should focus on that event, not any preceding meetings or other appearances.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's speeches during the St. Patrick's Day events. Let's check each relevant source. \n\nSearch result [1] is a YouTube video of Trump speaking at the 'Friends of Ireland' lunch. He mentions St. Patrick's Cathedral as a \"monument not only to God\" and talks about faith in God during a historical anecdote. That's two mentions. But wait, this is a luncheon, not the reception. Need to check if this is part of the same event.\n\nResult [3] and [9] refer to the St. Patrick's Day Reception at the White House at 5 PM ET. Result [9] is a transcript of the Oval Office meeting, but it doesn't mention \"God.\" However, result [8] and [19] are videos of the reception. In [8], Trump talks about St. Patrick's Church being defended by people with \"faith in God\" and refers to the cathedral as a monument to God. That's two instances. \n\nResult [16] and [18] mention Trump's speech at the reception where he called St. Patrick's Cathedral a \"monument not only to God\" and again referenced \"faith in God\" when discussing the church's defense. That's two uses. \n\nAdditionally, result [20] includes a video where Trump mentions \"faith in God\" and \"monument to God,\" which aligns with the other sources. \n\nSo, during the St. Patrick's Day Reception, Trump used the word \"God\" at least twice. The press conference in question is this reception, so the market should resolve to \"Yes.\"\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump used the term \"God\" at least twice during the St. Patrick's Day Reception with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. In his remarks about St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, he called it \"a monument not only to God\" and later referenced parishioners' \"faith in God\" while recounting their defense of the church during the War of 1812[1][16][18]. These two explicit uses of the term meet the market's resolution criteria. \n\nThe event in question was specifically the 5 PM ET St. Patrick's Day Reception, not earlier bilateral meetings[3][9]. Video evidence from multiple sources confirms both instances occurred during this scheduled reception[8][19][20]. No other forms or compound variations of \"God\" were identified in the remarks. \n\n**Resolution**: This market resolves to **Yes** (p2).",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"God\" two or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are specific: it's based on the press conference, not preceding meetings, and any form of the word \"God\" counts except other forms like \"Gods\" or \"Godly.\" The answer needs to be precise, citing the sources provided.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the search results related to the March 12 event. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nSearch result [1] from Politico describes the meeting as a 45-minute monologue by Trump with Martin present. It mentions Trump criticizing past presidents and the EU but doesn't note any religious references. No mention of \"God\" here.\n\nResult [3] is a CBS News video summary. The transcript snippet talks about Trump discussing tariffs and the EU, but again, no mention of \"God.\"\n\nResult [5] is another CBS News video about the meeting, highlighting Trump's comments on EU tariffs. The description doesn't include any religious terms.\n\nResult [7] is a YouTube transcript of the meeting. The parts shown discuss trade deficits, pharmaceutical companies, and the EU. No instances of \"God\" are present in the provided excerpts.\n\nResult [9] from Hindustan Times mentions Trump's stumble over \"patron saint\" but refers to Saint Patrick as the \"patron saint of Ireland,\" not using the word \"God.\" The article notes he called Saint Patrick a \"patriot saint\" by mistake, but that's a different term.\n\nResult [10] is a KMPH Fox26 video. The transcript includes Trump talking about trade and the EU. No mention of \"God\" here either.\n\nResult [13] is a transcript from Rev.com of the meeting. The provided parts show discussions about trade, tariffs, and Ireland's economic policies. No use of \"God\" in these excerpts.\n\nResult [14] from Euronews covers the same meeting, focusing on Trump's accusations about Ireland \"cheating\" the US. Again, no religious references.\n\nResult [15] is a detailed transcript of the Oval Office meeting. The conversation revolves around trade, pharmaceuticals, and Ireland's economic strategies. No mention of \"God\" in the provided sections.\n\nResult [16] from Arab News discusses potential topics like Gaza and trade but doesn't note any religious language during the press conference.\n\nResult [17] is another video transcript from LiveNOW from FOX. The remarks include discussions on education, tariffs, and Rosie O'Donnell, but no \"God\" references.\n\nOther results like [2], [4], [6], [8], [11], [12] are from different dates or contexts. For example, result [4] is from September 2024 about Trump's assassination attempts, and [8] is from February 2025 about a prayer breakfast. These don't pertain to the March 12 press conference.\n\nThe key here is that the query specifically asks about the press conference on March 12. None of the sources covering that event mention Trump using the word \"God.\" The only religious reference is in result [9], where Trump refers to Saint Patrick as the \"patron saint,\" but that's not the word \"God.\" Additionally, the user's note mentions that the resolution should ignore the St. Patrick's Day Reception unless explicitly linked to the press conference. The updates mention the reception, but the market is about the press conference.\n\nTherefore, based on the available sources, there's no evidence Trump said \"God\" two or more times during the specified press conference. The answer should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did not use the term \"God\" during the March 12, 2025 press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, based on available transcripts and media coverage of the event. While the meeting included discussions about trade deficits, pharmaceutical companies, and EU relations[1][14][15], none of the verified transcripts or contemporaneous reports show Trump invoking religious terminology during this specific press interaction[3][5][13][15].\n\nKey contextual details:\n- The closest religious reference came when Trump inaccurately called St. Patrick the \"patriot saint\" of Ireland during a separate St. Patrick's Day reception[9], but this occurred outside the press conference window specified in the resolution conditions\n- Earlier bilateral discussions referenced Ireland's \"family ancestry\" and Trump's Doonbeg property[15], but avoided theological language\n- Trade-focused exchanges dominated the press conference agenda, with Trump emphasizing that \"Ireland was very smart\" in attracting U.S. pharmaceutical companies through tax policies[13][14]\n\nThis contrasts with Trump's frequent religious rhetoric at other events, including:\n- A February 2025 prayer breakfast where he urged Americans to \"bring God back into our lives\"[8]\n- A September 2024 statement claiming \"God spared my life\" after assassination attempts[4]\n- Religious references in his official 2025 St. Patrick's Day message[11]\n\nHowever, these occurred outside the scope of the March 12 press conference. The resolution criteria explicitly exclude preceding bilateral meetings and focus only on the press conference/Q&A period[16]. No evidence meets the threshold for \"Yes\" resolution under the specified conditions.",
