        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Kent State vs. St. Bonaventure NIT game on March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Kent State wins, the market resolves to p2 (\"Kent State\"), and if St. Bonaventure wins, it's p1 (\"St. Bonaventure\"). If postponed, it stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The current timestamp given is March 19, 2025, 4:17 PM UTC, which is the next day. So the event date is in the past. \n\nNext, I look at the search results to determine the outcome. Multiple sources ([7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]) report that Kent State defeated St. Bonaventure 75-56. For example, source [7] from CBS Sports states the final score and mentions key players from Kent State contributing to the win. Source [11] confirms it's an NIT first-round game and notes Kent State's victory. Additionally, source [12] quotes the St. Bonaventure coach acknowledging the loss. \n\nAll these sources are consistent in reporting Kent State's win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event occurred as scheduled and Kent State won, the market should resolve to p2 according to the ancillary data. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in the query matches the sources. The teams, date, and context (NIT first round) all align across the sources and the query. No conflicting information is present. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Kent State Golden Flashes defeated the St. Bonaventure Bonnies 75-56 in their NIT first-round matchup on March 18, 2025. Multiple verified sources confirm the game occurred as scheduled with Kent State securing a decisive victory[7][8][9][10][11]. Key factors included:\n\n**Game Highlights**  \n- Kent State overcame an early 12-2 deficit with a 15-2 run to lead 29-28 at halftime[8][13]  \n- The Golden Flashes dominated the second half, shooting 56% from the field and 50% from three-point range[11][12]  \n- Four Kent State players scored double digits, led by VonCameron Davis (14 points) and Delrecco Gillespie (12 points, 10 rebounds)[7][9]  \n\n**Defining Metrics**  \n- Rebounding advantage: 47-29 in favor of Kent State[11][12]  \n- Second-chance points: 16-0 Kent State edge[12]  \n- St. Bonaventure shot just 34.4% overall and 30% in the second half[11][13]  \n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, meeting all specified resolution conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Kent State vs. St. Bonaventure NIT game on March 18, 2025) and verifies that it occurred as scheduled without postponement or cancellation. The outcome of the game is confirmed with multiple sources, which state that Kent State won. This aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Kent State win resolves to p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the event date against the current timestamp to confirm that the event is in the past. It then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The response also correctly matches the event details (teams, date, context) with the user prompt, ensuring that the resolution is for the correct event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome, ensuring that the information is not based on a single source and reducing the risk of inaccuracies. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 is based on verified facts that Kent State won the game.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question, uses verified sources, and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 is based on concrete evidence and established facts, which is the primary function of the AI in this context.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple sources and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and adheres to the guidelines for verifying past events and providing a resolution based on concrete evidence.\"\n}\n```",
