The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Washington Capitals vs. Detroit Red Wings game scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Capitals win, it's p1; if the Red Wings win, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the game date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources ([5], [7], [10], [13], [16]) report that the game took place on March 18, 2025. Specifically, the Capitals won 4-1. For example, result [5] states, \"Dylan Strome had a goal and an assist and the Washington Capitals beat the Detroit Red Wings 4-1 on Tuesday night.\" Tuesday, March 18, matches the scheduled date. \n\nI should verify that there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All relevant search results discuss the game as having been played, with detailed stats and player performances. There's no indication of any postponement or cancellation. \n\nNext, confirm the final score. Multiple sources ([5], [7], [10], [13], [16]) consistently report a 4-1 victory for the Capitals. For instance, result [13] says, \"Tom Wilson scored his 30th goal of the season in the Washington Capitals' 4-1 win against the Detroit Red Wings.\" This confirms the Capitals won.\n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and the Capitals won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Capitals). There's no ambiguity here. The sources are reliable and multiple, so the outcome is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Capitals defeated the Detroit Red Wings 4-1 in their NHL game on March 18, 2025, as verified by multiple sources[5][7][10][13][16]. The Capitals scored three third-period goals to secure the victory, with Tom Wilson reaching a career milestone of 30 goals and goaltender Logan Thompson earning his fifth straight win[5][13]. Since the game was completed as scheduled and Washington won decisively, the market resolves unambiguously to the Capitals' outcome. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
