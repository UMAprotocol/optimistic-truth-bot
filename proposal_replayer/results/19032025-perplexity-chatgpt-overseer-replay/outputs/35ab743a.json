        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chattanooga vs. Middle Tennessee basketball game. The ancillary data specifies that if Chattanooga wins, the market resolves to p2; if Middle Tennessee wins, it's p1. If the game is postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date given is March 19, 2025, and the game was scheduled for March 18 at 8:00 PM ET. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [7], [8]) report that the game took place on March 18 and ended with Chattanooga winning 109-103 in triple overtime. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the event wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources mention the game occurred as scheduled, so there's no indication of postponement or cancellation. The detailed recaps from the teams' official sites and ESPN confirm the game was played to completion. \n\nNow, verifying the winner. Source [1] states Chattanooga won 109-103, advancing to the next NIT round. Source [2] from ESPN also confirms the final score and Chattanooga's victory. Source [3], the Chattanooga athletics site, provides a detailed recap of their triple-overtime win. The YouTube highlights in [7] and the live score in [8] further corroborate the result. \n\nSince the game was played, and Chattanooga won, the market should resolve to p2 as per the ancillary data. The pre-game predictions in [4] and [6] had Middle Tennessee as slight favorites, but the actual outcome overrides those predictions. No sources suggest the game was incomplete or disputed. \n\nTherefore, based on verified results, the resolution is p2 (Chattanooga).\n</think>\n\nThe Chattanooga Mocs defeated the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders 109-103 in a triple-overtime thriller during the NIT first-round game played on March 18, 2025, at Murphy Center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee[1][2][3][7][8]. The game concluded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with Chattanooga outscoring Middle Tennessee 10-4 in the third overtime period to secure the victory[1][3]. Key performances included Bash Wieland (31 points) and Trey Bonham (27 points, 10 rebounds) for Chattanooga, while Middle Tennessee\u2019s Camryn Weston (31 points) and Essam Mostafa (30 points, 16 rebounds) set program records[1][2][3].\n\n**recommendation: p2**",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Chattanooga vs. Middle Tennessee basketball game) and its scheduled date (March 18, 2025). It verifies that the game occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. The outcome of the game is confirmed with multiple sources, stating that Chattanooga won. This aligns perfectly with the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for the game's occurrence, its completion, and the winner, which is Chattanooga. It uses multiple sources to confirm these details, ensuring the reliability of the information. The response also correctly ignores any pre-game predictions, focusing solely on the actual outcome, which is a critical requirement of the system prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and confirms the winner as Chattanooga. This verification is aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which dictates that a Chattanooga win should resolve to p2. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is therefore perfectly aligned with the facts and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any unnecessary bias towards either team and strictly adheres to verifying the factual outcome of the event.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Chattanooga) is based on verified and reliable sources, making it a confident and accurate resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence, its outcome, and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions without any errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event details and outcome, adhering strictly to the system prompt requirements and providing a logical and well-supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
