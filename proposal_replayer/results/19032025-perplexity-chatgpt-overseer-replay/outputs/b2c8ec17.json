        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Hell\" three or more times during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the videos and articles from the event. Let's look through each relevant result.\n\nSearch result [3] from Daily Motion mentions Trump accusing Ireland of cheating the US and includes a quote where he says, \"I don't know how the hell you do it.\" That's one instance.\n\nSearch result [7] (YouTube video) and [15] (another YouTube video) both mention Trump's comments during the St. Patrick's Day event. In [15], the transcript shows Trump saying, \"I don't know how the hell you do it.\" That's the same as in [3], so that's one.\n\nLooking at search result [10] from the Economic Times, there's a mention of Trump's warning to Tesla protestors with the phrase \"Will go through hell,\" but that's from a different context, not the press conference with Martin. So that might not count.\n\nSearch result [8] includes a transcript snippet where Trump says, \"I don't know how the hell you do it.\" Again, same as before. So that's another mention, but it's the same instance.\n\nWait, but the user's query specifies the press conference on March 12. The St. Patrick's Day Reception was at 5 PM ET, as per the update. The transcripts from the event in [8] and [15] both have Trump using \"hell\" once. \n\nLooking at [11], another video transcript, Trump talks about the church incident but doesn't use \"hell\" there. \n\nSearch result [10] also mentions Trump's comment about Rosie O'Donnell moving to Ireland, but no \"hell\" there. \n\nIn [3], the video description says Trump accused Ireland of taking advantage, and the transcript snippet includes \"I don't know how the hell you do it.\" That's one instance. \n\nWait, are there other instances? Let me check again. The user is looking for three or more uses. \n\nLooking at [15], the transcript from the prism video: Trump says, \"I don't know how the hell you do it.\" Then later, when discussing the church story, he says, \"they said God will never do this to us risking their lives they defended the church...\" No \"hell\" there. \n\nAnother possible instance: In [7], the video title mentions Trump shaming Ireland, but the transcript provided doesn't show another \"hell.\" \n\nWait, maybe I missed another instance. Let me check all results again. \n\nSearch result [16] from Foreign Policy discusses Trump's threats about hostages, but that's from January, not the March event. \n\nSearch result [12] is a video where Trump says \"all hell will break out,\" but that's from January 7th, unrelated to the March press conference. \n\nSo, based on the available sources, Trump used \"hell\" once during the press conference with the Irish PM. Therefore, the count is less than three. The answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, I need to ensure there are no other instances in the provided search results. \n\nDouble-checking all transcripts and articles related to the March 12 event: Only one instance of \"hell\" is found. Therefore, the market resolves to No.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump used the term \"hell\" once during his March 12, 2025, St. Patrick\u2019s Day press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. In a contentious exchange about Ireland\u2019s trade policies, Trump remarked, **\"I don't know how the hell you do it\"** while criticizing Ireland\u2019s corporate tax strategies that attract U.S. pharmaceutical companies[3][7][15].  \n\nNo other instances of the term were identified in the event\u2019s verified transcripts or video footage. While Trump frequently used \"hell\" in other contexts (e.g., Gaza hostage threats[2][5][12][16]), these occurred outside the scope of the specified press conference.  \n\n**Recommendation: p1** (No)",

The response correctly identifies that the term \"hell\" was used once by Donald Trump during this event, which aligns with the user's query about the number of times the term was used.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates thorough logical reasoning by checking multiple sources and confirming that the instances of the term \"hell\" were from the specified event. The AI also correctly disregards mentions of the term from other contexts or dates, which is crucial for the accuracy of the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event and aligns the recommendation with the facts found in the sources. The recommendation of p1 (No) is based on the concrete evidence that the term \"hell\" was used less than three times during the specified event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI has methodically checked each instance and source to ensure that the resolution is based solely on the specified event. The response does not show any missing information relevant to the resolution of the query.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, adheres strictly to the prompt instructions, and provides a well-supported recommendation based on verified facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the number of times the term 'hell' was used during the specified event and aligns with the user prompt conditions.

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742399982 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-19 15:59:42 UTC"
