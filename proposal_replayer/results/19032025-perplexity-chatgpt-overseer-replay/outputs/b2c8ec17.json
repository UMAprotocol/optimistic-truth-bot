        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Hell\" three or more times during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the word \"Hell\" in that specific event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The user included several sources, including news articles and video transcripts. The key here is to focus on the event mentioned: the St. Patrick's Day Reception with the Taoiseach of Ireland at 5 PM ET on March 12, 2025. \n\nLooking through the search results, there are a few mentions of Trump using the word \"Hell.\" For example, in source [13], during the reception, Trump says, \"I know too much about the Irish... I love the Irish special people... I have a lot of property in Ireland actually and uh does very well so I like it if it didn't do well I wouldn't like it but I'm always uh struck by the awesome beauty of the emerald aisle and the strength and warmth and grd and Grace of the Irish people...\" Wait, that doesn't include \"Hell.\" \n\nWait, source [14] is a transcript from the reception. Let me check that again. The transcript shows Trump saying, \"I have a lot of property in Ireland actually and uh does very well so I like it if it didn't do well I wouldn't like it...\" Still no \"Hell\" there. \n\nLooking at source [16], which is another transcript of the same event, Trump mentions, \"through trial and Triumph ups and downs thick and thin the extraordinary Irish people have stood by America...\" Again, no \"Hell.\" \n\nWait, source [15] mentions a video where Trump hosts the reception. The transcript includes: \"moved, I don't know how the hell you do it.\" That's one instance. Then, in the same source, later on, he says, \"Tony served as a White House advisor... he was so proud of his Heritage so I want to thank him and his family for the incredible job they did once again let me wish everyone a very happy St Patrick's Day...\" No \"Hell\" there. \n\nWait, in source [15], the exact quote is: \"moved, I don't know how the hell you do it. 05:01 ...\" So that's one occurrence. \n\nLooking at source [18], during the Oval Office meeting, Trump comments on JD Vance's socks, saying, \"What's with these socks. I love these socks. Don't distract me.\" No \"Hell\" there. \n\nSource [19] mentions Trump's speech at the reception: \"he was so proud of his Heritage so I want to thank him and his family for the incredible job they did once again let me wish everyone a very happy St Patrick's Day...\" No \"Hell\" here either. \n\nWait, source [12] is a transcript from a rally where Trump says, \"I don't know how the hell they'd\u2026 They've been to 167 rallies.\" But this is from a rally ahead of the inauguration, not the March 12 event. So that doesn't count. \n\nSource [13] and [14] are both from the St. Patrick's Day Reception. In [13], Trump says, \"I know too much about the Irish... I have a lot of property in Ireland actually and uh does very well so I like it if it didn't do well I wouldn't like it...\" No \"Hell\" here. \n\nWait, in source [15], the transcript includes: \"moved, I don't know how the hell you do it.\" That's one instance. Then, later in the same source, during the reception, Trump says, \"Tony is looking down on us right now and he was so proud of what he did and his Heritage he was so proud of his Heritage...\" No \"Hell\" there. \n\nAnother instance in source [15]: \"he was a great person great brilliant writer and uh so he will be very greatly missed and Tony is looking down on us right now and he was so proud of what he did and his Heritage he was so proud of his Heritage...\" Still no \"Hell.\" \n\nWait, maybe I missed another part. Let me check again. In source [15], the exact line is: \"04:59moved, I don't know how the hell you do it. 05:01 ...\" That's one. Then, in source [16], during the reception, Trump says, \"through trial and Triumph ups and downs thick and thin the extraordinary Irish people have stood by America...\" No \"Hell\" there. \n\nLooking at source [17], which is another video of the event, the transcript includes: \"he was a great person great brilliant writer and uh so he will be very greatly missed and Tony was looking down on us right now...\" No \"Hell\" here. \n\nWait, source [15] has one instance. Are there others? Let me check all sources again. \n\nSource [10] mentions Trump's comments during the Oval Office meeting: \"Trump's banter during the Oval Office meeting also touched on Vice President JD Vance's shamrock-themed socks and Trump nemesis Rosie O\u2019Donnell 's recent move to Ireland.\" No \"Hell\" here. \n\nSource [3] is a video titled \"Trump Slams Ireland's Trade Tactics In St. Patrick's Day Meet\" where the transcript includes: \"Ireland cheats the US\u2014that's what Donald Trump claimed during his St. Patrick\u2019s Day meeting with Irish PM Miche\u00e1l Martin at the White House.\" But the transcript snippet doesn't include \"Hell.\" \n\nSource [16] in the transcript: \"president Trump uh distinguished guests it is a singular honor uh to represent the people of Ireland As We Gather to celebrate St Patrick's Day...\" No \"Hell.\" \n\nWait, going back to source [15], the only instance I found is \"I don't know how the hell you do it.\" That's one. Are there any other instances in the provided sources from the specific event on March 12? \n\nLooking at source [14], the transcript includes: \"well thank you very much it's a great honor great people a lot of Irish friends right there a lot of very very good Irish friends but thank you all for being here even though it's still a few days away I want to be the first to wish each and every one of you a very happy St Patrick's Day...\" No \"Hell\" here. \n\nSource [19] mentions Trump's speech: \"Martin called on the U.S. to help 'move mountains' for global stability. Meanwhile, Trump raised concerns over trade imbalances and EU policies.\" No \"Hell\" here. \n\nSo, based on the provided search results, the only instance of Trump saying \"Hell\" during the specific event is once in source [15]. The user's query requires three or more instances for \"Yes\" (p2). Since only one instance is found, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). \n\nI need to confirm that all sources are checked thoroughly. The key here is that the event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception on March 12, 2025, at 5 PM ET. Any other events, like press conferences on different dates, don't count. The instances from January or other dates (like source [2], [4], [6], [8]) are from earlier events and don't apply here. \n\nTherefore, the resolution is \"No\" because there's only one occurrence of \"Hell\" during the specified event.\n</think>\n\nBased on the video evidence from the St. Patrick's Day Reception with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025, Donald Trump used the word \"hell\" **once** during the event. This occurred when he remarked, *\"I don't know how the hell you do it\"* while discussing Ireland\u2019s economic policies[15].  \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that \"hell\" must be spoken **3+ times** for a \"Yes\" (p2) outcome. Since only one instance was verified in the designated event, the market resolves to **No** (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception with the Taoiseach of Ireland on March 12, 2025. The AI thoroughly checks multiple sources to confirm the number of times the word \"Hell\" was used by Donald Trump during this specific event. The response adheres to the user prompt's requirement to count any usage of the term \"Hell\" regardless of context and confirms that only one instance was found.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a methodical approach by examining various sources and transcripts to ensure that all instances of the word \"Hell\" are accounted for during the event. The AI's reasoning process is transparent, showing how it checks each source and concludes based on the evidence found.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI correctly verifies that the event took place as scheduled and scrutinizes the appropriate sources to determine the number of times \"Hell\" was mentioned. The recommendation aligns with the facts gathered, as the market condition required three or more mentions to resolve to \"Yes,\" and only one was found, leading to a \"No\" resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The AI does not include irrelevant information and focuses solely on the event specified in the prompt. All sources are appropriately checked, and the AI does not stray from the event's context or the specific term in question.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It accurately and completely addresses the user prompt with a high degree of factual adherence and logical reasoning. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) is well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the number of times 'Hell' was mentioned during the specified event and aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and methodical, demonstrating careful analysis of the sources and adherence to the event specifics and terms outlined in the prompt.\"\n}\n```",

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742470037 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-20 11:27:17 UTC"
