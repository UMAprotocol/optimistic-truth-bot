The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"Biden\" during his press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Irish Prime Minister, on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes and p1 for No. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to see if there's any mention of Trump saying \"Biden\" during that specific event. The key here is the press conference on March 12, 2025. Let's look through the relevant sources.\n\nLooking at source [2], it's an article about Trump's meeting with Martin. The article mentions discussions on trade, Brexit, and cybersecurity, but there's no direct quote of Trump saying \"Biden.\" \n\nSource [5] is a YouTube transcript of the meeting. In the transcript, Trump talks about various topics, including Ukraine, tariffs, and criticism of Democrats. He mentions \"Biden\" in the context of blaming him for issues like the Afghanistan withdrawal and inflation. For example, he says, \"Biden should have never let it happen incompetence allowed this to happened this shouldn't have happened October 7th in the Middle East should have never happened with Israel uh the horrible leaving the way they left Afghanistan should have never happened inflation should have never happened...\" Here, he clearly uses the name \"Biden.\"\n\nSource [7] discusses the St. Patrick's Day visit and mentions Trump's criticism of the EU's tariffs. However, it doesn't directly quote Trump saying \"Biden.\" \n\nSource [19] is a transcript of Trump's meeting with Martin. In this transcript, Trump refers to \"sleepy Joe Biden\" and criticizes his policies, explicitly using the name \"Biden.\" For instance, he states, \"They took Crimea from a man named Obama, Barack Hussein Obama. They tried to take the whole thing from Biden.\"\n\nAdditionally, source [17] mentions Trump's criticism of Biden's policies during the meeting, though it doesn't provide a direct quote. However, sources [5] and [19] provide direct evidence of Trump mentioning \"Biden\" during the press conference.\n\nSince the resolution conditions state that any usage of the term \"Biden\" regardless of context counts, and pluralization/possessive forms are included, the instances in the transcripts meet the criteria. The press conference was held as scheduled, so the event wasn't canceled. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did mention \"Biden\" during his March 12, 2025, press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. In the transcript of their Oval Office exchange, Trump criticized Joe Biden's policies multiple times, including blaming him for the Afghanistan withdrawal and inflation:  \n\n> \"Biden should have never let it happen...inflation should have never happened\" [5][19].  \n\nHe also referenced Biden when discussing Russia-Ukraine relations:  \n> \"They tried to take the whole thing from Biden\" [19].  \n\nThe term \"Biden\" was used in its base form, satisfying the market\u2019s resolution criteria. Since the press conference occurred as scheduled and included Q&A segments, the context-agnostic usage of \"Biden\" triggers a **Yes** resolution.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response uses multiple sources to confirm the usage of the term \"Biden,\" which is crucial for resolving the market according to the specified conditions.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks for the occurrence of the term \"Biden\" in the context of the press conference and confirms this through multiple sources. The response also correctly identifies that any form of the term \"Biden,\" including pluralization and possessive forms, counts towards the resolution, and it confirms that the term was used in its base form.\n\nThe response also adheres to the requirement to verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt and ensures that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes. The response does not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date, which is in line with the instructions.\n\nHowever, there is a minor discrepancy in the user prompt and the response regarding the name of the Irish Prime Minister. The user prompt incorrectly mentions \"Donald Trump\" instead of \"Volodymyr Zelenskyy\" in the description, which seems to be a typographical error. Despite this, the response correctly identifies the individuals involved (Donald Trump and Miche\u00e1l Martin) and proceeds with the resolution based on the correct event details.\n\nOverall, the response is complete, and there are no significant missing information, bias, or errors. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) is well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the occurrence of the event and the usage of the term 'Biden' as per the conditions specified in the user prompt.

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742399859 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-19 15:57:39 UTC"
