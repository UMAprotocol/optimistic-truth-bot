The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"Biden\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. But wait, the ancillary data specifies that the market is about Donald Trump's press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, not Zelenskyy. That's a bit confusing. Maybe there's a mix-up in the names here. Let me check the query again.\n\nThe title mentions Zelenskyy, but the description and resolution conditions are about Trump's press conference. The user might have made a mistake, but I need to follow the ancillary data as per the instructions. The resolution is based on whether Trump says \"Biden\" during his presser with the Irish PM.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several mentions of Trump's interactions with Irish leaders. For example, in sources [14], [15], and [19], Trump hosted Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025, for St. Patrick's Day events. The transcripts in [17] and [18] show Trump discussing various topics, including Biden. Specifically, in [18], Trump criticizes Biden's handling of inflation, Afghanistan, and the Israel-Hamas conflict. He mentions Biden by name in those contexts.\n\nThe key point is whether Trump said \"Biden\" during the press conference part of the event. The updates mention the resolution is based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. The transcripts from the press conference (like [17] and [18]) include Trump referencing Biden multiple times, such as blaming him for past policies. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Trump did say \"Biden,\" the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths but also some critical issues that need addressing:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies a discrepancy in the user prompt regarding the names \"Volodymyr Zelenskyy\" and \"Donald Trump.\" It adheres to the ancillary data which specifies the market is about Donald Trump's press conference. This shows good adherence to the instructions to follow the ancillary data strictly.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for mentions of \"Biden\" during Trump's press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin. It uses transcripts as evidence that Trump mentioned \"Biden,\" which aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. This demonstrates a thorough approach to resolving the query based on the conditions provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place on March 12, 2025, and uses transcripts from the event to confirm that Trump mentioned \"Biden.\" This aligns well with the resolution conditions that any mention of the term, regardless of context, counts toward the market resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response initially shows confusion due to the mix-up in names in the user prompt but resolves this by adhering to the ancillary data. There is no apparent bias or significant error in the analysis. However, the response could improve by explicitly stating that the current date is past the event date, confirming that the event is not a future event relative to the timestamp.\n\nDespite the initial confusion, the response effectively uses the provided information and adheres to the resolution conditions. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Yes\" (p2) because Trump mentioned \"Biden\" during the press conference is supported by the evidence provided in the response.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the key individual as Donald Trump (despite the initial prompt confusion), verifies the occurrence of the event, and correctly applies the resolution conditions based on the evidence provided in the transcripts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response initially shows confusion due to a mix-up in names but resolves this correctly by adhering to the ancillary data. It could improve by explicitly confirming that the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp to avoid any ambiguity about the event being a future event.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742474946 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-20 12:49:06 UTC",
