The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Northwestern vs. Minnesota basketball game on March 12, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Northwestern wins, it's p2; Minnesota, p1; postponed stays open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, check the event date. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the game happened a week ago. Need to confirm if the game occurred as scheduled. Looking at the search results, multiple sources (1,4,5,7,8,15) report that the game took place on March 12. For example, source 1 says Northwestern defeated Minnesota 72-64 in the Big Ten Tournament opener on that date. Source 8's bracket also lists the game as completed with Northwestern winning. \n\nNext, verify the outcome. All relevant sources agree that Northwestern won 72-64. Sources 1,4,7,15 all mention the score and Northwestern's victory. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. The game was part of the tournament, so it's unlikely to be canceled. \n\nCheck for any discrepancies. All sources align on the result. No conflicting information found. The resolution conditions state a Northwestern win is p2. Since the game happened and Northwestern won, the correct resolution is p2. No signs of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nNorthwestern defeated Minnesota 72-64 in their Big Ten Tournament First Round game on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources including official game recaps and tournament brackets[1][4][7][8][15]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any available records. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Northwestern led for nearly 39 minutes and extended their advantage to 15 points in the second half[7]\n- Nick Martinelli scored 28 points, continuing his strong season performance[1][4][15]\n- The outcome aligns with Northwestern's earlier 75-63 regular-season victory over Minnesota on February 25[2][5]\n\nThe market resolves to **\"Northwestern\"** per the ancillary data's p2 designation for a Wildcats win. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
