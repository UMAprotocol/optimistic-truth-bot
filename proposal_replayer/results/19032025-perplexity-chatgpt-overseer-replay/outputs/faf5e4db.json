Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

The ancillary data specifies that if South Carolina wins, it's p2; if Arkansas wins, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the game on March 12 is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, sources [2], [6], [8], [9], [11] all mention the game on March 12. Specifically, [2] is an ESPN recap stating Arkansas won 72-68. [6] from The Daily Gamecock confirms South Carolina lost 72-68. [8] and [11] also show the final score as Arkansas 72, South Carolina 68. \n\nThe user's ancillary data says a win for Arkansas resolves to p1. Since all sources confirm Arkansas won, the resolution should be p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nI need to ensure that the event in the query matches the sources. The game date and teams align, so the outcome is clear. No conflicting information found. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe South Carolina vs. Arkansas men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET concluded with **Arkansas defeating South Carolina 72-68** in the SEC Tournament's first round[2][6][8][11]. Key details from verified sources:\n\n- Arkansas led by 20 points early in the second half but faced a late comeback attempt by South Carolina, which cut the deficit to 61-60[2][6].\n- Trevon Brazile (16 points, 7 rebounds) and Johnell Davis (14 points) were instrumental in securing Arkansas' victory[2][8].\n- The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game occurred[2][6][8].\n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **Arkansas (p1)** based on their confirmed victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
