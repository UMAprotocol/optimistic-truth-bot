The ancillary data specifies that if Dortmund advances, it resolves to p2, Lille to p1, and if canceled/postponed beyond Dec 31, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The search results mention the second leg was on March 12, 2025, which is before the current date of March 19, 2025. So the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles ([1], [3], [5], [6], [7], [10], [11]) report that Dortmund won the second leg 2-1 against Lille, leading to a 3-2 aggregate victory. They advanced to the quarter-finals where they'll face Barcelona. The box score from [4] also confirms the 2-1 win for Dortmund. \n\nThere's no mention of the match being canceled or postponed. All sources agree on the outcome. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Dortmund). The answer needs to clearly state this conclusion with proper citations from the search results.\n</think>\n\nBorussia Dortmund advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals after defeating Lille 3-2 on aggregate in their Round of 16 tie. The second leg, played on March 12, 2025, saw Dortmund overcome a 1-0 deficit from Jonathan David\u2019s early goal for Lille. Emre Can equalized via a 54th-minute penalty, and Maximilian Beier scored the decisive winner in the 65th minute to secure a 2-1 away victory[1][3][5][7]. \n\nThe aggregate result (3-2) confirmed Dortmund\u2019s progression, marking their first Champions League quarterfinal appearance since the previous season\u2019s runner-up campaign[6][10]. Lille, despite strong home form in the competition, failed to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in their history[1][6]. \n\n**Resolution**: The outcome aligns with the ancillary data\u2019s condition for \"Dortmund\" (p2), as official UEFA Champions League results confirm their advancement[1][3][4][6].  \nrecommendation: p2",
