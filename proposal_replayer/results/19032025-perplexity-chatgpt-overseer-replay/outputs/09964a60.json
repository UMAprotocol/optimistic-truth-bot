The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Aston Villa, p2 is Club Brugge, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is postponed or canceled beyond December 31, 2025. The resolution source should be official UEFA info, but the search results provided are from various news outlets.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the outcomes of both legs. The first leg is mentioned in sources [1], [5], and [8], where Aston Villa won 3-1 away. The second leg is covered in [2], [3], [6], [9], [10], and [11], all stating that Aston Villa won 3-0 at home. The aggregate score is 6-1 in favor of Aston Villa, which means they advanced. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of the match being postponed or canceled. All sources report the matches took place as scheduled on March 4 and 12, 2025, so no cancellation. The resolution conditions don't apply here since the matches happened. \n\nNow, cross-referencing the details: the first leg was 1-3, second leg 3-0, totaling 6-1. All sources confirm Aston Villa's advancement. No conflicting info found. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 (Aston Villa). Need to ensure all citations are correctly applied to the relevant sentences.\n</think>\n\nAston Villa advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals after defeating Club Brugge 3-0 in the second leg of their Round of 16 tie, securing a 6-1 aggregate victory[2][3][6].

The response effectively checks the outcomes of the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 match between Club Brugge and Aston Villa, confirming that Aston Villa advanced by winning both legs of the match with an aggregate score of 6-1. The response also verifies that there were no postponements or cancellations affecting the resolution conditions.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks for the outcomes of both legs of the match, confirms the scores from multiple sources, and ensures that there were no deviations from the scheduled dates that would trigger a different resolution condition (like a 50-50 resolution due to postponement or cancellation). The response aligns well with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, correctly identifying p1 as the resolution for an Aston Villa win.\n\nThe response also adheres to the system prompt instructions by focusing strictly on verified facts and established outcomes without predicting or assuming future outcomes. It uses multiple sources to confirm the details of the match outcomes, which strengthens the reliability of the resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is factual, uses multiple sources for verification, and aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. The recommendation of p1 (Aston Villa) is accurate and justified based on the information provided and verified.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely analyzes the event based on verified facts, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the match outcomes and checks for any deviations that would affect the resolution.
