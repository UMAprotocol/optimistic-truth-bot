Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Hornets vs. Hawks game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hawks win, it's p1; Hornets win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention two games between the Hornets and Hawks. The first is on March 12, 2025, where the Hawks won 123-110 [1][5][11][12]. The second game is on March 18, 2025, where the Hawks also won 134-102 [2][6][8][9]. \n\nWait, the query is about the March 12 game. Let me confirm the date. The user's query specifically references the March 12 game. The search results [1][5][11][12] all confirm that the game took place on March 12, 2025, with the Hawks winning. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation for that specific date. \n\nLooking at source [4], there were rescheduled games due to wildfires and an ice storm, but the March 12 game isn't listed as affected. The rescheduled games mentioned are for January and February 2025, not March. The March 12 game proceeded as planned. \n\nTherefore, the game occurred, and the Hawks won. According to the resolution conditions, a Hawks win corresponds to p1. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation, so the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Charlotte Hornets and Atlanta Hawks scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET was played as planned. The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Charlotte Hornets with a final score of **123-110**[1][5][11][12]. Trae Young led the Hawks with 35 points and 12 assists, while Miles Bridges scored 31 points for the Hornets in the loss[5][11]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by multiple detailed recaps and box scores from reputable sources[1][5][11][12]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
