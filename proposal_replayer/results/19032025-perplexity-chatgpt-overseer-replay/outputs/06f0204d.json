The resolution conditions state that if Arsenal advances, it's p1; PSV, p2; and if the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025, it's p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system mentions it's March 19, 2025. The event in question is the Round of 16 match between PSV and Arsenal. The ancillary data mentions the resolution source is official UEFA Champions League information. \n\nLooking at the search results, the first leg was on March 4, 2025, where Arsenal won 7-1 away (sources [2], [6], [7]). The second leg was on March 13, 2025, ending in a 2-2 draw (sources [1], [5], [8]). The aggregate score is 9-3 in favor of Arsenal. Multiple sources confirm that Arsenal advanced to the quarter-finals, specifically mentioning a 9-3 aggregate victory (sources [1], [5], [8]). \n\nSince both legs have been played and the aggregate score is confirmed, the event has already occurred. There's no mention of cancellation or postponement beyond the specified date. All sources agree Arsenal advanced. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 (Arsenal). \n\nI need to ensure that the answer clearly states the outcome, cites the relevant sources, and ends with the recommendation as per the instructions. Also, check that all dates are before December 31, 2025, which they are. No conflicting information in the sources. All point to Arsenal's advancement.\n</think>\n\nArsenal advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals with a 9-3 aggregate victory over PSV Eindhoven in the Round of 16. The Gunners secured a historic 7-1 away win in the first leg on March 4, 2025[2][6][7], followed by a 2-2 draw in the second leg at Emirates Stadium on March 13, 2025[1][5][8]. This comprehensive performance marked Arsenal's largest aggregate win in Champions League history and set up a quarter-final clash with Real Madrid[1][5].\n\n**Key details:**\n- **First leg:** Arsenal's 7-1 victory in Eindhoven set multiple records, including becoming the first team to score seven away goals in a Champions League knockout match[6][7].\n- **Second leg:** Despite rotating their squad, Arsenal maintained control of the tie with goals from Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice[1][5].\n- **Aggregate score:** 9-3 in Arsenal's favor, confirming their progression[1][5][8].\n\nThe match was completed within the specified timeframe with no cancellations or postponements. Official UEFA Champions League reports confirm Arsenal's advancement[1][5][8].\n\nrecommendation: p1",
