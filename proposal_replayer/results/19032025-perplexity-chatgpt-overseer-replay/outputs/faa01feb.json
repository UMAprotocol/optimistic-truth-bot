The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Letter\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and reports from the press conference. Let's look through the relevant results. \n\nLooking at result [8], which is a transcript of the White House St. Patrick's Day Reception, Trump's remarks are detailed. In his speech, he talks about various topics but there's no mention of the word \"Letter\" in the provided transcript excerpts. He mentions Ireland, trade, his property there, and other topics, but not \"Letter.\"\n\nResult [1] is a video transcript from Sky News covering the press conference. The transcript includes Trump discussing trade deficits, the EU, and other issues. Again, no instance of the word \"Letter\" is present here. \n\nResult [19] mentions Trump attempting to pronounce \"Taoiseach\" but doesn't reference the word \"Letter.\" Result [15] and [18] describe the meeting, focusing on trade and Trump's comments about Ireland taking advantage of the US, but again, no mention of \"Letter.\"\n\nOther results like [7] and [10] discuss previous meetings or other topics but don't relate to the specific press conference in question. \n\nThe user also provided updates indicating the resolution is based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. Checking the transcripts and reports from that event, there's no evidence Trump used the word \"Letter.\" All mentions are about trade, Ireland's policies, and other topics unrelated to the term in question.\n\nSince none of the search results show Trump saying \"Letter\" during the press conference, the resolution should be \"No.\" Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths but also some critical areas that need addressing to ensure the resolution is accurate and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question is the press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025, and checks for the usage of the word \"Letter\" by Donald Trump. The AI reviews multiple sources, including transcripts and video transcripts, to verify whether the term was mentioned. This thorough check aligns well with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence from the event.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical, moving from the definition of the resolution conditions to the examination of specific sources that would contain evidence of the term's usage. The response systematically dismisses irrelevant results and focuses on those pertinent to the event, which demonstrates a good alignment with the prompt's requirement to focus strictly on the specified event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms that the event took place as scheduled and that the term \"Letter\" was not mentioned by Donald Trump during the event. This leads to a recommendation of p1 (\"No\"), which correctly aligns with the facts as verified from the sources.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors in the processing of information. However, there is a critical oversight regarding the update provided in the user prompt. The update mentions that the resolution will be based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception, not just the press conference. The AI's response does not clearly differentiate or confirm whether the sources reviewed specifically covered the St. Patrick's Day Reception or just the press conference. This ambiguity could lead to an incorrect resolution if the contexts were not properly distinguished.\n\nGiven the critical nature of ensuring that the resolution is based on the exact event specified and considering the ambiguity introduced by the update in the user prompt, a re-evaluation is necessary to confirm that the sources reviewed indeed pertain to the St. Patrick's Day Reception as well as the press conference.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"Need to confirm that the sources reviewed specifically pertain to the St. Patrick's Day Reception as indicated in the update, to ensure the resolution is based on the correct event context.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response was thorough and logical but failed to address the update in the user prompt that shifts the resolution context to the St. Patrick's Day Reception.

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742470276 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-20 11:31:16 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say the word \"letter\" during his press conference with Ireland's Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he does, considering any context, pluralization, or possessive forms. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key here is to look through the transcripts and summaries of the events mentioned. The user mentioned an update that shifts the context to the St. Patrick's Day Reception, so I need to focus on that specific event.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [6] is a transcript from the White House St. Patrick's Day Reception. In the transcript, Trump says, \"I want to thank you both for being here. The first official visit to the White House. So thank you very much for being there with us. Thank you.\" There's no mention of the word \"letter\" here. \n\nResult [10] mentions that during the Oval Office meeting, Trump was asked to name his favorite person in Ireland, but again, no \"letter\" reference. \n\nResult [19] is a transcript of the Oval Office meeting. Scanning through it, Trump talks about his properties in Ireland, thanks the Prime Minister, but doesn't use the word \"letter.\" \n\nResult [12] and [14] discuss a different press conference with UK's Prime Minister Starmer, where a letter from King Charles was presented. However, this is a separate event from the one with Ireland's PM. \n\nResult [7] talks about a letter from US lawmakers urging Trump to appoint a special envoy, but this isn't part of the press conference in question. \n\nResult [9] mentions a letter from a rape crisis charity, but that's unrelated to Trump's statements during the event. \n\nResult [18] is a transcript from a 1965 press conference, which is irrelevant here. \n\nThe key point is that the St. Patrick's Day Reception (result [6]) and the Oval Office press conference (result [19]) transcripts don't include the word \"letter.\" The other events where \"letter\" is mentioned are not the specified press conference with Ireland's PM. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, Trump did not say \"letter\" during the relevant event. The market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not use the word \"letter\" during the March 12, 2025 St. Patrick's Day Reception with Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin, based on available transcripts and video evidence[6][19]. While the term appears in unrelated contexts across the search results - such as a UK trade discussion where Keir Starmer presented a royal invitation[12][14], and a rape crisis charity's open letter condemning Conor McGregor's White House visit[9] - none of these instances occurred during the specified bilateral event with Ireland's leader.\n\nThe key evidence comes from:\n1. The official reception transcript showing Trump's remarks focused on Irish-American relations and pharmaceutical trade disputes[6]\n2. The Oval Office meeting transcript confirming discussions about tariffs and corporate taxation without \"letter\" references[19]\n3. Multiple press reports about the event's content[4][10][13] that make no mention of correspondence-related terminology\n\nThis resolution aligns with the market's specific parameters requiring direct usage during the designated St. Patrick's Day Reception press engagement[1][6][19].",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the updated user prompt that shifts the resolution context to the St. Patrick's Day Reception with the Taoiseach of Ireland. It correctly identifies that the term \"letter\" must be mentioned during this specific event for the market to resolve to \"Yes.\" The response also correctly identifies that the term was not mentioned during the event, based on the transcripts and video evidence provided.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking through the transcripts of the relevant event and confirming the absence of the term \"letter.\" It also correctly disregards mentions of the term in other contexts that do not pertain to the specific event in question. This shows a thorough approach to ensuring that all conditions set by the market are met.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception and not any other meetings or receptions involving President Trump and the Irish Taoiseach. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" aligns with the factual evidence provided in the transcripts and video sources.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not appear to be missing any critical information necessary for resolving the query. It effectively uses the sources mentioned to substantiate its findings.\n\nGiven the thorough analysis and adherence to the user prompt, the response is satisfactory.
