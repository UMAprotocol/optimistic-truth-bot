        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Letter\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the exact term \"letter\" (including plural or possessive forms) was used. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles from the event. Let's go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at source [12], there's a mention of a letter from King Charles III presented by the British PM to Trump. However, this was during a meeting with Keir Starmer, not Miche\u00e1l Martin. The user's query specifies the press conference with the Irish PM, so this doesn't count.\n\nSource [15] mentions that Martin was to present a bowl of shamrock, not a letter. The transcript in source [6] shows Trump talking about the Irish and their contributions but no mention of a letter. \n\nIn source [7], the transcript includes Trump discussing various topics like trade and Conor McGregor, but again, no mention of \"letter.\" Similarly, source [17] has a detailed transcript of their conversation, covering taxes, housing, and other issues, but no instance of the word \"letter.\"\n\nSource [12] also notes that Martin quoted Trump from a previous St. Patrick's Day speech, but the term \"letter\" isn't used there. The press conference focused on trade, tariffs, and mutual investments, as per sources [4], [5], and [18].\n\nSince none of the search results indicate that Trump used the word \"letter\" during the specific press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, the answer should resolve to \"No.\" All mentions of letters in the sources refer to other contexts or meetings, not the event in question.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether Donald Trump said the word \"letter\" during his March 12, 2025, press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. The resolution depends on verifying whether the term \"letter\" (including plural/possessive forms) was uttered during the event.  \n\n### Analysis of Evidence  \n1. **Event Focus**: The press conference centered on trade disputes, Ireland\u2019s corporate tax policies, and lighthearted exchanges about Conor McGregor and Rosie O\u2019Donnell[4][5][14]. No transcripts or reports mention Trump using the word \"letter\" during this interaction.  \n2. **Contextual References**: While a letter from King Charles III was mentioned in prior meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer[12][15], this occurred in a separate bilateral discussion, not during the Martin press conference.  \n3. **Verbatim Transcripts**: Video transcripts of the event[2][5][17] show Trump discussing tariffs, pharmaceutical companies, and Irish-American relations but do not include the term \"letter\" in any form.  \n\n### Resolution  \nThe term \"letter\" was not used during the designated press conference. References to letters in other contexts (e.g., UK-Irish diplomacy) are irrelevant to this specific market\u2019s resolution.  \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

The response correctly identifies that the term \"letter\" must be used in the context of this specific event and not in any other meetings or contexts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking through various sources that could potentially contain the information needed (transcripts, articles). It correctly concludes that the term \"letter\" was not mentioned by Trump during the press conference based on the evidence from these sources.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and examines the content of the press conference through multiple sources. The recommendation aligns with the facts presented, as none of the sources indicate that the term \"letter\" was used by Trump during the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks relevant sources and bases its conclusion on direct evidence from these sources.\n\nGiven the analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation of p1 (No) is appropriately supported by the evidence reviewed.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, logically analyzes the sources, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm that the term 'letter' was not mentioned during the specified event, leading to a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742401877 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-19 16:31:17 UTC"
