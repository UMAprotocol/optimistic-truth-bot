The game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The current date is March 19, 2025, so the event has already taken place. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results include several sources from March 19, 2025, which report on the game's outcome. Sources [2], [3], [4], [5], and [8] all mention that Arkansas State defeated Saint Louis with a score of 103-78 in the NIT first round. These are reliable sources, including the official athletics websites of both universities and CBS Sports. \n\nNext, I need to confirm that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. The detailed game reports indicate that the game took place on the scheduled date and time. There's no mention of any postponement or cancellation in any of the sources. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Arkansas State wins, the market resolves to \"Arkansas State\" (p1). Since all the post-game reports confirm Arkansas State's victory, the correct resolution is p1. \n\nI should also ensure that there's no conflicting information. All sources consistently report Arkansas State's win, so there's no ambiguity. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NIT first-round game between Saint Louis and Arkansas State took place as scheduled on March 18, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. Arkansas State secured a decisive 103-78 victory over Saint Louis, as confirmed by multiple official sources including both universities' athletic departments[2][3][5], CBS Sports[4], and local news outlets[8]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was clearly determined with Arkansas State winning by 25 points.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
