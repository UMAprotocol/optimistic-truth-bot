        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Saudi Arabia\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the exact term was mentioned. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The main sources are news articles and a podcast about the meeting between Trump and Miche\u00e1l Martin. The key here is to look for any mention of \"Saudi Arabia\" during their press conference.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them discuss the trade issues between the US and Ireland, tariffs, and the St. Patrick's Day events. There's mention of Trump's previous interactions with Saudi Arabia, like the 2017 speech and a call with the UK PM about Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia. However, these are from earlier dates or different contexts.\n\nIn the specific event on March 12, 2025, the articles [1], [3], [4], [6], [7], [13], and [18] detail the press conference. None of these mention Trump discussing Saudi Arabia during that event. The discussions were focused on trade deficits, pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, and other topics like Rosie O'Donnell and Conor McGregor. \n\nThe podcast [2] and YouTube video [18] transcripts also don't indicate any mention of Saudi Arabia. The user's ancillary data specifies that only the press conference on March 12 counts, not preceding meetings. Since all the sources from that day don't reference Saudi Arabia, it's safe to conclude the term wasn't used there. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the March 12, 2025 press conference between Donald Trump and Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, there is no evidence that Trump uttered the term \"Saudi Arabia\" during the event. The discussion focused on:\n\n- **Trade relations**: Trump criticized Ireland's tax policies attracting U.S. pharmaceutical companies[1][13], while Martin highlighted Ireland's Boeing purchases and job creation in America[1][3][7].\n- **St. Patrick\u2019s Day traditions**: The shamrock ceremony and lighthearted exchanges about socks and Conor McGregor[1][18].\n- **EU tensions**: Trump reiterated his view that the EU was created to disadvantage the U.S.[1][4][13].\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia was mentioned in other contexts (e.g., Trump\u2019s March 10 call with the UK PM about Ukraine talks[5] and historical 2017 speeches[9][15][17]), these occurred outside the scope of the March 12 press conference. The resolution criteria explicitly exclude preceding bilateral meetings and focus solely on the scheduled press event.\n\n**recommendation: p1**",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and verification of the event. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the user prompt by focusing solely on whether Donald Trump mentioned \"Saudi Arabia\" during the press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the term \"Saudi Arabia\" must be mentioned explicitly during the event to resolve the market to \"Yes\". The response also correctly excludes any mentions of Saudi Arabia outside the specific event, such as previous speeches or different contexts, which aligns with the user prompt requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a thorough analysis by checking multiple sources (articles and a podcast) that cover the event. It lists the topics discussed during the press conference, which were relevant to the resolution conditions but did not include the term \"Saudi Arabia\". This shows a logical approach to verifying the absence of the term during the event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and examines the content of the press conference based on reliable sources. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) is based on the concrete evidence that \"Saudi Arabia\" was not mentioned during the event, which aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question and uses multiple sources to confirm the absence of the term \"Saudi Arabia\".\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to resolve the market to \"No\" is well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, provides a logical and complete analysis, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the absence of the term 'Saudi Arabia' during the specified event, adhering closely to the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742401645 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-19 16:27:25 UTC"
