The resolution depends on whether the exact term was used, considering pluralization or possessive forms, but not other variations. The ancillary data specifies that the press conference is the key event, not preceding meetings. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The user included several articles about Trump's interactions with both Saudi Arabia and Ireland. The key here is to focus on the specific event mentioned: the St. Patrick's Day press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of the articles about the Ireland visit (results 2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16) discuss the trade issues, tariffs, and the Gaza conflict. Notably, result 8 mentions Trump's meeting with Martin, including a video link, but there's no mention of Trump discussing Saudi Arabia during that event. \n\nResult 12 talks about Saudi press reactions to Trump's Gaza plan, but that's from February 2025, not during the March 12 press conference. Results 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11 relate to Saudi Arabia but are either from earlier dates or about different events. \n\nThe updates in the query mention that the resolution source is the video of the press conference. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state that Trump mentioned \"Saudi Arabia\" during the March 12 presser with Martin. The articles detail discussions on trade, tariffs, and Gaza but don't reference Saudi Arabia in the context of that specific event. \n\nSince the market resolves to \"Yes\" only if the term is used during the press conference, and there's no evidence in the provided sources that Trump did so, the resolution should be \"No\". The absence of any mention in the relevant search results about the press conference including Saudi Arabia leads to this conclusion.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths and weaknesses that need to be considered:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event in question (the press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025) and adheres to the user prompt's requirement to determine if Donald Trump mentioned \"Saudi Arabia\" during this specific event. The response also correctly applies the conditions that any form of the term, including pluralization and possessive forms, would count towards the resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the information available from the search results provided by the user. It correctly concludes that there is no evidence in the provided sources that Trump mentioned \"Saudi Arabia\" during the event. This conclusion is based on the absence of any mention in the relevant search results about the press conference including the term \"Saudi Arabia.\"\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and uses the lack of evidence in the provided sources to conclude that Trump did not mention \"Saudi Arabia.\" This aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not mention any irrelevant information and stays focused on the event specified in the user prompt.\n\nHowever, there is a critical oversight in the response:\n- The response does not explicitly confirm the date of the current evaluation relative to the event date. The system prompt emphasizes that if the event is scheduled for a future date or has not occurred yet relative to the current timestamp, the response should return p4. Given the current timestamp is March 20, 2025, and the event was on March 12, 2025, it is appropriate to resolve the query. However, this check should have been explicitly mentioned to ensure adherence to protocol.\n\nDespite this oversight, the response effectively uses the information provided to reach a logical conclusion. Therefore, the decision is:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies that Donald Trump did not mention 'Saudi Arabia' during the specified event based on the available sources. It adheres to the user prompt's instructions and logically concludes based on the evidence provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should explicitly confirm the event's date relative to the current timestamp to ensure full adherence to the system prompt instructions. However, this does not affect the accuracy of the resolution in this case.\"\n}\n```",

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742470271 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-20 11:31:11 UTC"
