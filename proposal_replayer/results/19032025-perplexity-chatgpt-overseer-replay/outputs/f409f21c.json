        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"beautiful\" three or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on the exact term \"beautiful\" being used, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET, as per the update.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to find instances where Trump used the word \"beautiful\" during that specific event. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at source [1], there's a mention of Trump calling Ireland a \"beautiful island of 5 million people\" during the Oval Office meeting. However, this might be part of the bilateral meeting, not the press conference. The ancillary data states that preceding bilateral meetings don't count, only the press conference.\n\nSource [2] includes a quote from Trump at the reception: \"this beautiful White House this evening for the annual shamrock ceremony.\" That's during the St. Patrick's Day Reception, which is the event in question. So that's one instance.\n\nSource [5] has Trump saying, \"this beautiful White House this evening for the annual shamrock ceremony\" again. That's the same event, so another mention here. Wait, but maybe it's the same instance being reported in different sources. Need to check if these are separate events or the same.\n\nSource [7] includes Trump referring to Caitriona Perry as part of the \"beautiful Irish press\" during a past event in 2017. But that's not the 2025 press conference, so it doesn't count here.\n\nSource [9] and [10] discuss a 2017 incident, which is irrelevant for the 2025 event.\n\nSource [15] is a transcript of the Oval Office meeting, which again is a bilateral meeting, not the press conference. The ancillary data specifies that only the press conference counts.\n\nSource [16] mentions Trump describing Ireland as a \"beautiful island,\" but this is from the Oval Office meeting, not the reception.\n\nSource [5] (again) in the transcript part shows Trump saying \"beautiful White House\" during the reception. Another instance in the same source: \"the most beautiful places on this Earth\" referring to Ireland. That's two instances.\n\nWait, in source [5], during the reception, Trump says: \"this beautiful White House\" and later mentions \"the most beautiful places on this Earth.\" That's two uses. Then, in the same speech, he also says \"beautiful Irish friends\" when presenting the shamrock. Let me check the exact transcript parts.\n\nLooking at source [5], the transcript includes:\n\n1. \"this beautiful White House this evening for the annual shamrock ceremony\"\n2. \"the most beautiful places on this Earth\"\n3. \"a lot of very very good Irish friends but thank you all for being here even though it's still a few days away I want to be the first to wish each and every one of you a very happy St Patrick's Day\"\n\nWait, the third one doesn't include \"beautiful.\" Let me check again. The exact quotes from source [5]:\n\n- \"this beautiful White House this evening for the annual shamrock ceremony\"\n- \"the most beautiful places on this Earth\"\n- \"beautiful Irish press\" (but that's from 2017 in another source)\nWait, in source [5], the user might have multiple instances. Let me parse the exact timestamps.\n\nIn source [5], the transcript shows:\n\nAt timestamp {ts:145920}: \"this beautiful White House this evening for the annual shamrock ceremony\"\n\nLater, at {ts:3864760}: \"the most beautiful places on this Earth\"\n\nThen, when presenting the shamrock, he says: \"great people a lot of Irish friends right there a lot of very very good Irish friend but thank you all for being here...\" No \"beautiful\" there.\n\nWait, maybe another instance. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at source [5], the full transcript part includes:\n\n- \"this beautiful White House this evening for the annual shamrock ceremony\" [1st]\n- \"the most beautiful places on this Earth\" [2nd]\n- \"beautiful Testament to their incredible resolve\" [3rd]\n\nWait, in the same source [5], there's a part where Trump talks about St. Patrick's Church: \"St. Patrick still stands as a beautiful Testament to their incredible resolve and bravery...\" That's a third instance.\n\nSo that's three uses of \"beautiful\" during the reception. Therefore, the count is three, meeting the threshold of three or more. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nDuring the St. Patrick's Day Reception with Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025, President Donald Trump used the word \"beautiful\" three times in contexts that meet the resolution criteria:\n\n1. **\"This beautiful White House this evening\"** - Describing the venue during the shamrock ceremony[2][5]  \n2. **\"The most beautiful places on this Earth\"** - Referring to Ireland's landscape[5]  \n3. **\"A beautiful Testament to their incredible resolve\"** - Discussing St. Patrick's Church's history[5]  \n\nAll instances occurred during the qualifying event timeframe and context. The resolution conditions specify that pluralization/possessive forms count, though none were used here. No evidence suggests cancellation or technical issues affecting the event.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
