        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"beautiful\" three or more times during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes if he did, p1 for No if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key here is to look for instances where Trump used the word \"beautiful\" during the specific event mentioned. The ancillary data mentions that the press conference is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. \n\nLooking through the sources, several mention Trump's remarks during the event. Source [10] includes a transcript where Trump says \"beautiful\" twice: once referring to the White House as \"this beautiful White House\" and again when talking about Ireland's beauty. Source [13] and [17] also have transcripts where he uses \"beautiful\" multiple times, including \"beautiful wife Mary\" and \"beautiful place\" about Ireland. \n\nWait, in source [10], he says \"beautiful White House\" and \"beautiful wife Mary\". Then in the same source, he mentions \"the beauty of County Clair\" and \"beautiful place\". That's at least three instances. Also, source [6] quotes him saying \"this beautiful White House\" and \"beautiful shamrock bowl\". \n\nBut I need to confirm if these instances are from the specific press conference on March 12. The event in source [11] is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET, which matches the updated resolution source. The transcripts from sources [10], [13], and [17] all reference that event. \n\nCounting the uses: \"beautiful White House\", \"beautiful wife Mary\", \"beautiful place\", and \"beautiful shamrock bowl\" \u2013 that's four instances. Even if some are from different parts of his speech, they all occur during the same event. Therefore, the count exceeds three. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that pluralization or possessive forms count, but other forms don't. All instances here are the exact word \"beautiful\". So, the answer should be Yes, which corresponds to p2.\n</think>\n\nBased on analysis of the press conference video transcripts and verified instances from multiple sources, Donald Trump used the word \"beautiful\" **4 times** during the March 12, 2025 St. Patrick's Day Reception with Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin:\n\n1. Describing the White House as _\"this beautiful White House\"_ [6][10][16]  \n2. Referring to Ireland's County Clare as _\"a beautiful place\"_ [10][13][17]  \n3. Praising Martin's wife as _\"his beautiful wife Mary\"_ [10][13][17]  \n4. Complimenting the shamrock bowl gift as _\"beautiful\"_ [6][16]  \n\nThe term was used in its base form each time, meeting the resolution criteria. No compound variations or contested forms were observed. The event occurred as scheduled on March 12 at 5 PM ET, with no cancellations reported[11].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event as the St. Patrick's Day Reception with the Irish Taoiseach on March 12, 2025, and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The response also correctly identifies that the term \"beautiful\" was used four times, which meets the criteria for a \"Yes\" resolution (p2).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a logical analysis of the sources and transcripts, counting the instances of the word \"beautiful\" and confirming that they all occurred during the specified event. The reasoning is clear, and the response is complete as it addresses all parts of the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and that the word \"beautiful\" was used in the context required by the market resolution conditions. The recommendation of p2 is aligned with these facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the instances of the word \"beautiful,\" which strengthens its reliability.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately counts the instances of the word 'beautiful' during the specified event, adheres to the resolution conditions, and provides a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to verify the occurrences of the term and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt conditions.

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742470488 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-20 11:34:48 UTC"
