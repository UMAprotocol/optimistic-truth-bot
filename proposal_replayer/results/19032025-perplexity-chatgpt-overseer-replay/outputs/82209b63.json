        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Hawks vs. Hornets game on March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hawks win, it's p2 (Hawks), Hornets win p1 (Hornets), postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query mentions March 18 at 7:00 PM ET. The current date provided is March 19, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Now, I check the search results to find out who won. \n\nLooking at the sources, result [1] is a YouTube video titled \"HAWKS at HORNETS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | March 18, 2025\" and the description states the Hawks defeated the Hornets 134-102. The date on this result is March 19, which makes sense as the game was on the 18th, and the recap would be posted the next day. \n\nResult [3] from SI.com also confirms the Hawks won 134-102, mentioning they swept the season series. Similarly, result [4] from Hornets' Substack notes the final score as Hornets 102, Hawks 134. Result [8] from another SI.com article reiterates the Hawks' blowout win. \n\nAll these sources consistently report the Hawks' victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are clear: Hawks win is p2. Since the event occurred and the outcome is verified by multiple sources, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks defeated the Charlotte Hornets 134-102 in their March 18, 2025 matchup at Spectrum Center. Multiple sources confirm the Hawks led wire-to-wire, with Trae Young scoring 31 points (5-9 from three-point range) and rookie Zaccharie Risacher adding 21 points in a dominant third-quarter performance[1][3][4]. The Hornets were missing key players LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges, contributing to their 17th consecutive loss[3][4].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Hawks 134, Hornets 102[1][4][8]\n- Game occurred as scheduled on March 18, 2025 at 7:00 PM ET[1][6]\n- No indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][3][4][8]\n\nBased on the resolution conditions and verified game outcome:\n\nrecommendation: p2",
