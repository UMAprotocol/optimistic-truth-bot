The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of a college basketball game between UT Arlington and Grand Canyon scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Grand Canyon wins, the market resolves to p1 (Grand Canyon), if UT Arlington wins, p2 (UT Arlington), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date provided is March 19, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [5], [7], [8]) report that Grand Canyon defeated UT Arlington 98-75 in the WAC Tournament quarterfinal on March 12, 2025. The game recap from ESPN and the university's official site both confirm the score and that Grand Canyon advanced to the semifinals. The box score from thescore.com also lists the final score as 98-75 in favor of Grand Canyon. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled with a clear result. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Grand Canyon won, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. The other search results [2] and [4] discuss a women's basketball game between the same universities on March 15, which isn't relevant here. Result [6] is about betting odds before the game, which doesn't affect the outcome. \n\nEverything points to Grand Canyon winning decisively. No issues with the event being canceled or postponed. So the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between UT Arlington and Grand Canyon scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET concluded with **Grand Canyon defeating UT Arlington 98-75** in the WAC Tournament quarterfinals. The game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation[1][3][5][7][8].  \n\nKey details:  \n- **Final score**: Grand Canyon 98, UT Arlington 75  \n- Grand Canyon led by 14 points at halftime (46-32) and maintained a double-digit advantage throughout the second half[1][7].  \n- Six Grand Canyon players scored in double figures, led by JaKobe Coles with 24 points[1][5][7].  \n\nSince the game was completed and Grand Canyon won decisively, the market resolves to **Grand Canyon** per the resolution conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of the event, and alignment of the recommendation with the facts provided in the user prompt. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event in question, the CBB game between UT Arlington and Grand Canyon scheduled for March 12, 2025. The response correctly notes that the game has already occurred by the current timestamp of March 19, 2025. It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, confirming that Grand Canyon won the game with a score of 98-75. This is in line with the user prompt's requirement to resolve the market based on the game's outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by first establishing the date of the event and confirming it is in the past. It then verifies the outcome through reliable sources, ensuring there was no postponement or cancellation. The response also checks for irrelevant or conflicting information and correctly dismisses it, focusing solely on the relevant men's basketball game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through credible sources. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Grand Canyon win) directly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies how the market should resolve based on the game's outcome.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event specified in the prompt and uses verified information to resolve the query.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It adheres strictly to the instructions, uses verified facts to make a resolution, and aligns perfectly with the conditions outlined in the user prompt. There is no need for a rerun or adjustment in the response as it meets the required standards of accuracy and reliability.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies and verifies the event's outcome using reliable sources, adheres to the user prompt instructions, and logically concludes with a correct market resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event outcome and aligns the recommendation with the specified resolution conditions without any factual errors or logical inconsistencies.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
