The ancillary data specifies that if Mississippi State wins, it's p1; LSU wins, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date given is March 19, 2025, which is after March 12, so the game should have already happened. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources (1,2,5,6,8,11,12,13) report that Mississippi State defeated LSU 91-62 in the SEC Tournament first round on March 12. The scores are consistent across these sources, and the date matches the scheduled event. \n\nI should verify that there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All results indicate the game took place as planned. The detailed stats and post-game recaps confirm the outcome. Since Mississippi State won decisively, the correct resolution according to the ancillary data is p1. There's no conflicting information in the search results, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nMississippi State defeated LSU 91-62 in their SEC Tournament first-round game on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][5][6][8][11][12][13].
