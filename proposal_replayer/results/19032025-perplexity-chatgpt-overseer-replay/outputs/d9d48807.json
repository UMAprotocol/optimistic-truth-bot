        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the LSU vs. Mississippi State basketball game played on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Mississippi State wins, it's p1; if LSU wins, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the game is in the past. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [5], [7]) report that Mississippi State defeated LSU 91-62 in the SEC Tournament first round on March 12. For example, source [1] states the final score and that Mississippi State advanced. Source [3] from Mississippi State's official site also confirms the win with details. \n\nI should verify that the event in question is the same as reported. All sources mention the SEC Tournament game on March 12, 2025, at Bridgestone Arena. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation; instead, they all discuss the game happening as scheduled. \n\nSince the game was played and Mississippi State won decisively, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. No sources indicate any issues with the game being incomplete or canceled. All evidence points to a clear Mississippi State victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nMississippi State defeated LSU 91-62 in their SEC Tournament first-round game on March 12, 2025, at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville[1][3][4][7]. The Bulldogs dominated with program records for 3-pointers made (15) and margin of victory (29 points) in an SEC Tournament game[3][4]. Josh Hubbard led all scorers with 26 points, including six three-pointers[1][3][5]. LSU's season ended with a 14-18 record[5][7].\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations mentioned in any sources[1][3][4][5][7]. According to the resolution conditions, this outcome requires resolving to **p1** (Mississippi State win).\n\nrecommendation: p1",
