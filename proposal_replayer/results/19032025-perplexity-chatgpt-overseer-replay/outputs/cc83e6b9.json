        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Israel\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that any mention of \"Israel\" in the presser counts, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The resolution is p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for mentions of Trump saying \"Israel\" during that event. Looking through the sources:\n\n- Source [1] mentions Trump discussing Gaza and relations with Israel, but it's during the meeting, not the press conference. The press conference is a separate event.\n- Source [3] describes the Oval Office meeting and the shamrock ceremony. Trump talks about Israel closing its embassy in Ireland, but again, this is part of the bilateral meeting, not the press conference.\n- Source [13] and [17] have Trump talking about Israel during the meeting with Martin, mentioning hostages and October 7th. However, the transcript in [17] and [18] shows Trump discussing Israel in the Oval Office meeting, not the press conference.\n- The key point is the ancillary data specifies that the press conference is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. The updates mention the resolution is based on that event. \n\nLooking at the press conference details in sources [3], [10], and [12], the main event was the shamrock ceremony. The press conference part might have been during the East Room event. However, the transcripts in [17] and [18] are from the Oval Office meeting, which is a preceding bilateral meeting, not the press conference. The ancillary data says preceding meetings don't count. \n\nTherefore, even though Trump mentioned Israel in the Oval Office meeting, the press conference (St. Patrick's Day Reception) might not include those mentions. The search results don't explicitly show Trump saying \"Israel\" during the press conference itself. Hence, the resolution should be p1 (No) because the mentions were in the bilateral meeting, not the specified press conference.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided search results and resolution conditions, Donald Trump did mention \"Israel\" during his interactions with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. However, these references occurred during their **Oval Office bilateral meeting** rather than the designated **5 PM ET St. Patrick's Day Reception press conference** that serves as this market's resolution event[1][3][13][17].\n\nKey evidence:\n- Trump discussed Israel's embassy closure in Ireland and Hamas hostages during the Oval Office meeting[1][13][17]\n- The transcript shows Trump stating: *\"Israel has been under siege... October 7 was a terrible thing\"* during the bilateral discussion[17][18]\n- No direct evidence exists of \"Israel\" being mentioned during the evening reception ceremony that constitutes the resolution event\n\nWhile Israel was discussed earlier in the day, the market explicitly excludes \"preceding bilateral meetings\" and focuses solely on the scheduled 5 PM ET reception[3][10]. Since the resolution source must be the designated press conference footage and no evidence shows the term being used there, the market resolves accordingly.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

This adheres strictly to the user prompt requirement that only mentions of \"Israel\" during the press conference count towards the market resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically separates the events of the day and correctly identifies that the mentions of \"Israel\" did not occur during the St. Patrick's Day Reception press conference but during the bilateral meeting. This distinction is critical and is well-handled in the response. The response uses multiple sources to confirm that the term \"Israel\" was not mentioned in the context required by the market.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the facts by recommending p1 (No), as there is no evidence of Trump mentioning \"Israel\" during the press conference itself. This is in line with the ancillary data and user prompt conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks the conditions and context specified in the user prompt and uses appropriate sources to confirm the details of the event.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It adheres to the system prompt instructions, provides a logically sound analysis based on verified facts, and aligns the recommendation correctly with the ancillary data provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the context and conditions of the event, adheres to the user prompt instructions, and provides a well-supported recommendation based on verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the details of the event and correctly applies the conditions specified in the user prompt to arrive at a logical recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742401063 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-19 16:17:43 UTC"
