The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Israel\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the word \"Israel\" during that specific event. The query specifies that only the press conference counts, not preceding meetings. The resolution source is the video of the press conference, so I should look for transcripts or reports from that event.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [5] is a YouTube video titled \"Trump speaks on Ireland's relationship with Israel\" with a transcript. The transcript shows Trump discussing Israel multiple times. For example, he mentions \"Israel is Been Under Siege\" and refers to the October 7th attacks. He also talks about meeting with hostages and their treatment, which relates to Israel. The transcript is from the press conference, as indicated by the context of the discussion with the Irish PM about Ireland's relationship with Israel.\n\nOther sources like [1], [3], [4], and [7] mention Trump's comments about Gaza and Ireland-Israel relations, but they don't specifically cite the press conference. However, the YouTube transcript in [5] is direct evidence from the event in question. \n\nThe ancillary data states that any usage of \"Israel\" counts, including possessive or plural forms. The transcript shows Trump using \"Israel\" explicitly, so the answer should be Yes (p2). There's no indication the event was canceled, and the video confirms the term was used. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nDuring the March 12, 2025 press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, Donald Trump explicitly mentioned \"Israel\" multiple times while discussing geopolitical issues. In a video transcript of the event, Trump referenced Israel's security situation, stating: *\"Israel is Been Under Siege as you can see and they had to fight back October 7th was a terrible thing\"* [5]. He later reiterated concerns about hostages held by Hamas, emphasizing Israel's perspective: *\"I asked him was there any kindness... everybody said all of these people said zero it was hatred\"* [5].\n\nThe discussion specifically addressed Ireland-Israel relations, with Trump acknowledging the strained diplomatic context following Israel's embassy closure in Dublin. While the press conference primarily focused on trade and humanitarian aid, Trump's responses to questions about Middle East policy included direct references to Israel as a nation-state [5][7].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt by focusing on verified facts and using a video transcript as a source to confirm the occurrence of the event and the specific mention of \"Israel.\"\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI correctly identifies the relevant event and uses a direct source (YouTube video transcript) to verify that Trump mentioned \"Israel\" during the press conference. This aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies that any mention of \"Israel,\" including possessive or plural forms, would result in a resolution of \"Yes\" (p2).\n\nThe response also adheres to the requirement of using concrete evidence from the specified event, as it relies on a transcript from the press conference itself rather than other unrelated sources. This ensures that the resolution is based on the specific event mentioned in the user prompt.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not infer or assume information beyond what is presented in the sources it references. It strictly adheres to the details provided in the user prompt and the ancillary data for resolution conditions.\n\nHowever, the response could improve by explicitly mentioning that it checked for the cancellation or postponement of the event, as stated in the user prompt conditions. This would ensure complete adherence to all specified conditions and provide a more thorough verification process.\n\nOverall, the response is satisfactory as it stands, but a minor improvement could be made by confirming the event's occurrence explicitly.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies that Donald Trump mentioned 'Israel' during the specified event, using a direct source from the event.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742558166 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-21 11:56:06 UTC",
