        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Jacksonville State vs. Georgia Tech game. The event date is March 18, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The current timestamp given is March 19, 2025, so the game has already occurred. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the outcome. Looking at the sources, multiple articles ([1], [4], [5], [7]) report that Jacksonville State won 81-64. Specifically, source [1] from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution details the game's result, including the score and key player performances. The Associated Press articles ([4], [5]) also confirm the win, noting it was Jacksonville State's first NIT victory. Additionally, source [7] provides a comprehensive breakdown of the game, highlighting Jaron Pierre Jr.'s 30 points. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Jacksonville State wins, the market resolves to p2. Since all credible sources confirm their victory, there's no ambiguity. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nGeorgia Tech faced Jacksonville State in the NIT first round on March 18, 2025, at McCamish Pavilion. Jacksonville State dominated the game, winning **81-64**[1][4][5][7]. The Gamecocks led by as many as 24 points in the second half, shooting 51.7% from the field and making 15-of-30 three-pointers[1][7]. Jaron Pierre Jr. scored a game-high 30 points for Jacksonville State, while Georgia Tech\u2019s Duncan Powell and Lance Terry each had 15 points[4][5][7]. The loss ended Georgia Tech\u2019s season with a 17-17 record[1][6].\n\n**Resolution**: The game occurred as scheduled, and Jacksonville State won decisively. According to the ancillary data, the market resolves to **p2** (Jacksonville State). \n\nrecommendation: p2",
