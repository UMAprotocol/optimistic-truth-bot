        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"NATO\" three or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Trump saying \"NATO\" during that specific event. The press conference in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET on March 12. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's interactions with the Irish PM and NATO. For example, result [3] describes the St. Patrick's Day event where Trump and Martin discussed trade, but there's no mention of NATO in that context. Result [11] is a video where Trump talks about trade imbalances and tariffs with Ireland, but again, no direct mention of NATO. \n\nHowever, result [13] includes a transcript snippet from the press conference where Trump is asked about Ireland joining NATO. He responds, \"that's up to Ireland,\" and discusses the EU's relationship with Ireland. In this exchange, he mentions NATO explicitly. Another instance in the same transcript occurs when a reporter asks about Ireland's EU relations, and Trump refers to his experience with the EU and NATO, saying, \"the EU was terrible and they stopped really a magnificent addition.\" Here, \"NATO\" is mentioned again. \n\nWait, let me verify. The exact transcript from [13] shows Trump saying, \"NATO uh can be a force for the good absolutely would you like to see Ireland join NATO Mr President that's up to Ireland...\" So that's at least two mentions. Is there a third? Later in the same transcript, when discussing EU approvals, Trump says, \"I don't know why it would take 5 to seven years to get something approved but that's why it was...\" which doesn't mention NATO again. \n\nWait, maybe another part. Let me check other sources. Result [4] has a transcript where Trump talks about NATO in the context of Ireland joining, but that's from a different event on March 12, perhaps the bilateral meeting, which the user specified doesn't count. The press conference is the reception at 5 PM. \n\nLooking at result [14], it's a live coverage link of the St. Patrick's Day Reception, but the transcript isn't provided. The key source is [13], where Trump mentions NATO twice during the Q&A. Are there any other instances in the provided results? Result [7] discusses trade but not NATO during the presser. Result [11] mentions Trump threatening tariffs but no NATO references. \n\nSo, based on the available transcripts, Trump mentioned NATO twice during the press conference. Since the requirement is three or more mentions, the answer would be No (p1). However, I need to ensure there's no third mention. Let me recheck. In [13], the exchange includes two mentions: one when asked about Ireland joining NATO and another when discussing the EU's role. Wait, in the transcript, after the first mention, the reporter follows up about Ireland and the EU, and Trump responds, mentioning NATO again. Let me count:\n\n1. Reporter asks about Ireland joining NATO. Trump says, \"that's up to Ireland.\"\n2. Reporter asks about Ireland-EU relations. Trump says, \"NATO uh can be a force for the good...\"\n\nWait, maybe that's one mention. Wait, the exact transcript in [13] is: \"would you like to see Ireland join NATO Mr President that's up to Ireland well do you think Ireland and the EU are too close...\" Here, \"NATO\" is mentioned once. Then later, Trump says, \"NATO uh can be a force for the good...\" That's a second mention. Is there a third? The rest of the transcript doesn't show another instance. \n\nTherefore, only two mentions of NATO during the press conference. Hence, the resolution should be No (p1). But wait, the user's ancillary data says the market resolves to Yes if the term is said 3+ times. Since the count is two, it's below the threshold. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths and weaknesses that need to be evaluated:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies the event in question (the press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025) and adheres to the user's conditions regarding the counting of the term \"NATO.\"\n   - The AI checks multiple sources to confirm the number of times \"NATO\" was mentioned, which shows diligence in verifying facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The response demonstrates a thorough process of checking and cross-referencing sources to count the mentions of \"NATO.\" It correctly concludes that \"NATO\" was mentioned twice, which is below the threshold needed for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n   - The AI's reasoning process is transparent, showing how it arrived at the conclusion based on the evidence from the transcripts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The AI correctly identifies that the event has occurred and that the resolution should be based on the actual mentions of \"NATO\" during the event.\n   - The recommendation aligns with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response:**\n   - The response does not appear to have any significant bias or errors. It methodically checks the available information and bases its recommendation on the evidence found.\n   - There is no missing information that would affect the outcome of the resolution.\n\nGiven these points, the response from Perplexity AI is accurate, complete, and adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The logical reasoning is sound, and the verification of the event aligns with the facts. The recommendation of p1 (No) is appropriate based on the evidence that \"NATO\" was mentioned only twice, which does not meet the threshold for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately counts the mentions of 'NATO' and aligns with the user's resolution conditions. The logical reasoning and verification of facts are sound.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the number of mentions and provides a clear, reasoned recommendation based on the evidence.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742402019 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-19 16:33:39 UTC"
