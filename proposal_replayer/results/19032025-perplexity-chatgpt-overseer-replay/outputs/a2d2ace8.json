The ancillary data specifies that if the Blues win, it's p2 (Blues), if the Predators win, p1 (Predators), and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 19, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources confirm the game occurred. \n\nSearch result [1] from CBS Sports clearly states the Blues won 4-1. The date of the article is March 19, 2025, which is the day after the game, so it's a recap. The title mentions the Blues defeating the Predators, and the details include the score, key players, and context about the game. This is a reliable source.\n\nOther sources like [10] from the Predators' official site also confirm the loss, with a final score of 4-1. This adds credibility since it's the team's own report. \n\nThere are also pre-game predictions and analyses (sources [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [9]), but those are not needed since the game has already taken place. The YouTube video [4] seems to be gameplay footage, but the transcript snippets don't contradict the final score. \n\nSource [8] is from December 2024, which is a previous game, so irrelevant here. \n\nAll the post-game reports agree on the Blues' victory. No sources mention postponement or cancellation. Therefore, the game was played, and the Blues won. According to the resolution conditions, this means the market resolves to p2 (Blues).\n</think>\n\nThe St. Louis Blues defeated the Nashville Predators 4-1 in their NHL game on March 18, 2025, as confirmed by multiple post-game reports[1][10]. Jordan Kyrou scored two goals, Joel Hofer made 22 saves, and the Blues extended their winning streak to three games while the Predators suffered their third consecutive loss[1][10]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the verified sources. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:\n   - The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between St. Louis Blues and Nashville Predators) occurred on March 18, 2025, and the current date is March 19, 2025, making the event a past occurrence.\n   - The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, noting that the St. Louis Blues won against the Nashville Predators with a score of 4-1. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Blues win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n   - The response correctly ignores pre-game predictions and irrelevant past events, focusing solely on verified post-game reports to determine the outcome.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness:\n   - The response methodically checks for the occurrence of the game, its outcome, and any potential postponements or cancellations. It confirms the game was played as scheduled.\n   - The response uses credible sources such as CBS Sports and the official site of the Nashville Predators, enhancing the reliability of the information.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The response verifies the event against the date it was scheduled and uses the correct date to confirm it is reviewing the appropriate game.\n   - The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:\n   - There is no evident bias or errors in the response. The response does not rely on speculative or unverified sources.\n   - All necessary information to resolve the query appears to be included, and the response does not introduce any irrelevant details that could confuse the resolution process.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event and the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the NHL game using credible sources, aligns with the resolution conditions, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the game's outcome and makes a correct market resolution recommendation based on the user prompt's conditions.\"\n}\n```",
