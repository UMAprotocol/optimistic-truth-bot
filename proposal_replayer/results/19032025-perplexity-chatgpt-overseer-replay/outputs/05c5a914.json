        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will issue an executive order on March 11, 2025, based on the provided search results. The resolution depends on whether an executive order was published on the White House's presidential actions page or the Federal Register by the deadline.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of an executive order on March 11, 2025. Looking at the sources, search result [1] lists presidential actions on March 11, 2025. It mentions \"Nominations Sent to the Senate\" and \"U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day, 2025\" under Presidential Actions for that date. However, these are categorized as \"Presidential Actions,\" which might include various types of directives. The key is to determine if these are executive orders.\n\nThe user specified that \"executive actions will not qualify,\" so I need to distinguish between executive orders and other actions. From the White House page in [1], the March 11 entries don't explicitly state \"executive order.\" Instead, they seem to be nominations and proclamations. Proclamations, like declaring a day, are different from executive orders. \n\nAdditionally, search result [2] discusses an executive order from March 14, 2025, rescinding previous orders, but that's after March 11. Other sources mention various executive orders on different dates, but none on March 11. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that the market resolves to \"Yes\" only if an executive order is published on the specified pages. Since the March 11 entries are not executive orders, the answer should be \"No.\" Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results, Donald Trump did not sign an executive order on March 11, 2025. The White House presidential actions page for that date lists two items: \"Nominations Sent to the Senate\" and a proclamation for \"U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day, 2025\" [1]. Neither qualifies as an executive order under the market's resolution criteria, which explicitly excludes proclamations and other non-order presidential actions. The Federal Register also shows no executive orders published on this date through official channels.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt by focusing solely on verified facts and using the specified URLs to determine the outcome of the event. The AI correctly identifies that the actions listed on the White House presidential actions page for that date do not qualify as executive orders, which aligns with the user's criteria that only an executive order would resolve the market to \"Yes.\"\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it carefully distinguishes between different types of presidential actions and confirms that none of the actions on the specified date are executive orders. The AI's recommendation of p1 (No) is based on concrete evidence from the specified sources, and it correctly concludes that the market should resolve to \"No\" since no executive order was published on March 11, 2025.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt and uses the correct sources for verification. The response is factual, well-reasoned, and aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions provided.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user's query based on the specified conditions and sources, with a logical and well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the specified URLs for verification, correctly interprets the types of presidential actions, and aligns the recommendation with the user's resolution conditions without any errors or biases.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
