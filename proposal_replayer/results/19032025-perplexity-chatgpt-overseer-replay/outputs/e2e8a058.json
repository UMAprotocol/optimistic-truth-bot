The ancillary data specifies that if Oklahoma State wins, it's p1; Wichita State, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results all mention the game took place on March 18, 2025, at 8:00 PM in Stillwater. The current date provided is March 19, 2025, so the event is in the past. \n\nNext, verifying the outcome. Multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8]) report Oklahoma State won 89-79. For example, source [1] states, \"Oklahoma State's 89-79 victory over Wichita State on Tuesday night in the NIT.\" The score is consistent across all reports. \n\nCheck for any postponement or cancellation. All sources confirm the game happened as planned. No mentions of delays or cancellations. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: Oklahoma State's win should resolve to p1. Since the event occurred and the result is verified, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nOklahoma State defeated Wichita State 89-79 in their NIT tournament game played on March 18, 2025, at 8:00 PM CT in Stillwater[1][2][5][8]. Multiple independent sources confirm the Cowboys secured a 10-point victory through strong performances from Bryce Thompson (23 points, 5 steals) and balanced team contributions[1][3][6][7]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][5][8].\n\nBased on the resolution parameters provided, where Oklahoma State's victory corresponds to p1 resolution, the market should resolve accordingly.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Wichita State vs. Oklahoma State basketball game) and verifies that it occurred on March 18, 2025, which is consistent with the user prompt that specifies the game date. The response also correctly identifies the outcome of the game with Oklahoma State winning 89-79, which matches the resolution condition p1 for an Oklahoma State win.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for the occurrence of the game, verifies the outcome through multiple sources, and checks for any postponements or cancellations. It then aligns the verified outcome with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt, leading to a recommendation of p1. This shows a thorough and logical approach to resolving the query based on the provided conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple independent sources, ensuring reliability. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.
