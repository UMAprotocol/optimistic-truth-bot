        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Ducks vs. Stars game on March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Stars win, it's p1; if the Ducks win, p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the game happened on March 18, which is the day before. That's in the past, so I need to verify the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game result. Source [1] mentions the Stars won 4-3 in overtime with Mikael Granlund scoring the winning goal. Source [2] also states the Ducks lost 4-3 in OT, with Granlund getting the game-winner. Source [6] and [10] both corroborate the Stars' victory. The NHL's official recap in [10] clearly states the Stars won 4-3 in OT. \n\nAll these sources are consistent. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so the resolution depends on the winner. Since the Stars won, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information found. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Anaheim Ducks and Dallas Stars on March 18, 2025, concluded with a **4-3 overtime victory for the Dallas Stars** at American Airlines Center. Mikael Granlund scored the game-winning goal at 2:32 of overtime, his second goal of the night, securing the Stars' 43rd win of the season[1][2][6][10]. \n\nKey details:\n- The Stars overcame a 3-2 third-period deficit with Thomas Harley's tying goal at 4:37 of the final frame[1][6].\n- Anaheim's Leo Carlsson scored twice, including his first career penalty shot goal, but couldn't prevent the overtime loss[2][6].\n- Dallas improved to 43-21-3 while Anaheim fell to 29-31-8[10].\n\nAs the Dallas Stars won the game, the market resolves to **\"Stars\"** per the ancillary data conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
