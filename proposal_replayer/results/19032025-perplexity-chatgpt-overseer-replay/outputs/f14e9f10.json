The ancillary data specifies that if DePaul wins, it's p2; Georgetown, p1; postponed stays open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The given current date is March 19, 2025, which is after March 12. So the game should have already happened. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] is a recap from March 12, 2025, stating DePaul won 71-67 in the Big East Tournament. That's a direct confirmation. Result [4] also mentions DePaul's win over Georgetown on March 12, with a score of 71-67. Result [7] from ESPN's game summary confirms the same score. \n\nThere's another game mentioned on March 8 where DePaul also won, but that's a regular-season game. The query is about the March 12 game. The COVID-19 postponement in [3] is from 2021, so irrelevant here. \n\nAll relevant sources agree that DePaul won the March 12 game. No mentions of postponement or cancellation. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2 (DePaul). Need to make sure the event date is past and the outcome is verified. Since all sources confirm DePaul's victory, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe DePaul vs. Georgetown men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 6:30 PM ET was played as planned, with DePaul defeating Georgetown 71-67 in the Big East Tournament[1][4][7]. The game outcome was decisive, featuring key performances from NJ Benson (18 points off the bench) and Layden Blocker (16 points)[1][4]. No postponement or cancellation occurred, as evidenced by multiple verified game recaps and box scores from official sources[1][4][7].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (DePaul vs. Georgetown game) occurred on March 12, 2025, and the current date is March 19, 2025, which is after the event date. The AI checked multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is that DePaul won against Georgetown with a score of 71-67. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition that if DePaul wins, the market should resolve to \"p2\".\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by verifying the event date and ensuring it is in the past relative to the current timestamp. It also confirms the outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable and not based on a single source. The response also correctly ignores irrelevant information such as a different game on March 8 and a COVID-19 postponement from 2021.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple credible sources, ensuring that the information is not only accurate but also verifiable. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"p2\" is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI has focused strictly on the event in question and used verified sources to confirm the outcome.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"p2\" is based on verified facts and aligns perfectly with the user's conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the DePaul vs. Georgetown game and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome, adheres to the prompt instructions, and logically excludes irrelevant information.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
