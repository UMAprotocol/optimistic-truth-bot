  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865998\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:39:58",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether PSV Eindhoven or Arsenal will advance to the next round of the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. The resolution depends on the official outcome of their two-legged tie. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time provided: March 13, 2025, 12:38:55 PM. The second leg was scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 21:00 CET, which would be 8 PM UTC. Since the current timestamp is after that, the match has already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13]) report that Arsenal won the first leg 7-1 and drew the second leg 2-2, resulting in a 9-3 aggregate victory. The second leg's outcome is confirmed, and all sources agree that Arsenal advanced to the quarter-finals. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that if Arsenal advances, the market resolves to \"Arsenal\" (p1), and if PSV does, to \"PSV\" (p2). Since the event has concluded and Arsenal clearly won on aggregate, the correct resolution is p1. There's no indication of cancellation or postponement beyond the deadline, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event wasn't scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp. Since both legs have been played and the result is confirmed, there's no future aspect here. All sources, including UEFA's official site, ESPN, and others, corroborate Arsenal's advancement. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nArsenal advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals with a 9-3 aggregate victory over PSV Eindhoven following a 2-2 draw in the second leg at the Emirates Stadium on March 12, 2025[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][12][13]. The Gunners had already secured progression after their historic 7-1 first-leg win in the Netherlands[1][3][11][12], making the second leg a formality. Despite PSV's improved performance in London, Arsenal's aggregate margin remained insurmountable[2][4][7][9]. UEFA's official match reports and multiple verified sports media outlets confirm Arsenal's advancement[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][12][13]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
