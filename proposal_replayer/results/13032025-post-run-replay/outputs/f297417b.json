  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request about whether the price of a dozen eggs hits $5 before April 2025. The current date is March 13, 2025, and the resolution depends on data from the St. Louis Fed's FRED series APU0000708111. The data up to January 2025 shows the price at $4.953, just slightly below $5. The February data was scheduled to be released on March 12, 2025, which is yesterday relative to the current timestamp. The user provided multiple sources, including the Farm Action letter, FRED data, news articles, and prediction markets.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the February 2025 data is available. The Farm Action letter from February 12, 2025, mentions January 2025 prices at $6.00\u2013$8.00 per dozen, which seems conflicting. Wait, no, looking closer, the Farm Action letter's Figure 12 shows the national average retail price in January 2025 as part of their data, but the FRED data from source [5] for January 2025 is $4.953. There's a discrepancy here. However, the USDA report in source [14] states that January 2025 prices exceeded previous records, reaching a 53% increase from January 2024, and the BLS data in source [5] lists January 2025 at $4.953. \n\nWait, the Farm Action letter might be referring to wholesale prices or different metrics. The user's ancillary data includes a query about the price reaching $5 in any datapoint between January and March. The key is whether the February data, released on March 12, 2025, shows a price at or above $5. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [10] is a prediction market resolving based on February 2025 data, which was to be released on March 12. The current timestamp is March 13, so that data should be available. Source [10] mentions that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the February price is higher than January's. However, the user's specific query is about hitting $5 before April. \n\nThe FRED data in source [5] shows January 2025 at $4.953 and December 2024 at $4.146. The February 2025 data would be crucial here. Since the current date is March 13, the February data should have been published. However, none of the provided search results include the February 2025 data point. The Farm Action letter's data goes up to January 2025. The news articles from February 26, 2025 (sources [14], [15]) mention forecasts of a 41% rise in 2025 but don't provide the February figure. \n\nThe prediction markets in sources [10], [18], and [19] were betting on February's price, with some suggesting a possible increase. However, without the actual February data in the provided context, I can't confirm if it reached $5. The user's ancillary data includes a resolution condition where p2 (Yes) is 1 if the price hits $5 in any January-March data. Since January was $4.953, very close to $5, and if February's data, released on March 12, is above $5, then the answer is Yes. However, since the provided search results don't include the February data, I have to rely on available information. \n\nWait, source [22] mentions that from January 2024 to January 2025, the price rose from $2.52 to $4.95, which aligns with FRED's January 2025 data. Another source [23] states the price is $4.95 as of March 5, 2025. The ancillary query's resolution depends on any datapoint between January and March reaching $5. The March data isn't out yet (current date is March 13), but January was $4.953, very close. If the data is rounded, maybe it's considered $5. However, the resolution requires the price to be $5.000 or greater to the third decimal. Since January is $4.953, which is $4.95 when rounded to two decimals, it's under $5. The February data, if just released, might tip it over. But without seeing it, and given the user's instructions to only use provided sources, which don't include February's actual data, I can't confirm. However, the Farm Action letter mentions January prices up to $8 retail, but that might be an outlier or different metric. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to only use verified facts up to the current date, and the February data isn't present in the provided context, even though it should have been released, I have to assume it's not available in the search results provided. Therefore, based on the latest available data (January at $4.953), the price hasn't reached $5 yet. However, the prediction markets and news suggest expectations of rising prices, but without verified data, I can't confirm. Therefore, the answer would be p4, as the event's outcome (February data) isn't verified in the provided sources, making it unresolved.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
