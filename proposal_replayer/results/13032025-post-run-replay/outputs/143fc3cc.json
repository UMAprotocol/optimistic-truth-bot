  "user_prompt": "\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Kevin O'Connell get traded?, description: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Kevin O'Connell, Head Coach of the Minnesota Vikings, is traded to another NFL team by 4:00 PM ET on March 12, 2025. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from the NFL, however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n",
  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741868342\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:19:02",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Kevin O'Connell will be traded by March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The system says it's March 13, 2025, 13:17:59 UTC. The deadline was March 12 at 4 PM ET, which is March 12 around 20:00 UTC. Since the current time is past that deadline, any trade would have already happened.\n\nLooking at the search results, the key info is in sources [12] and [10]. On January 21, 2025, the Vikings announced a multi-year extension with O'Connell, as reported by NFL Network and others. That's after the initial rumors about teams wanting to trade for him. Jay Glazer mentioned multiple teams were interested, but the Vikings moved quickly to extend him. \n\nThe extension means O'Connell is under contract beyond 2025, so the Vikings wouldn't trade him. The original query's deadline has passed, and no trade occurred. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No,\" which is p1. The sources confirm the extension was finalized before the deadline, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
