  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741871146\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 14:05:46",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the Texas vs. Vanderbilt college basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if Texas wins, it's p2; Vanderbilt, p1; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 14:04:39, which is the day after the game was supposed to take place. The search results provided include articles from March 12 and 13, 2025. Let me look through the sources to find the actual result.\n\nLooking at the search results, sources [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [9], and [10] all mention the game between Texas and Vanderbilt in the SEC Tournament. For example, source [3] is titled \"Takeaways from Texas's do-or-die win over Vanderbilt to stay alive on the bubble\" and dated March 13, 2025. The article states that Texas won 79-72. Similarly, source [4] from CBS Sports confirms the same score, with Mark and Johnson each scoring 19 points for Texas. Source [5] from SI.com also reports Vanderbilt's loss to Texas, 79-72. Multiple other sources corroborate this result, including [6], [7], [9], and [10], all indicating a Texas victory.\n\nSince the game was played on March 12, 2025, and the result is clearly a Texas win, the market should resolve to p2 (Texas). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirm the game took place as scheduled, with Texas emerging victorious. Therefore, the resolution should be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
