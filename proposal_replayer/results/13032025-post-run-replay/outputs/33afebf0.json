  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741864264\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:11:04",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They need to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the Phoenix Suns vs. Houston Rockets game on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on who won that game. \n\nFirst, I check the current date and time provided: March 13, 2025, 12:08 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 12 at 8:00 PM ET, which is March 13, 1:00 AM UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, I review the search results to find the game's outcome. The search results [1], [3], [9], [15], and [16] all report that the Houston Rockets won 111-104 against the Phoenix Suns. These sources are reputable, including ESPN and local news outlets, which adds credibility. \n\nI also check for any mentions of postponement or cancellation. None of the search results indicate that the game was postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place with a clear result. \n\nSince the game occurred as scheduled and the Rockets won, the market should resolve to \"Rockets,\" which corresponds to p1. The user's instructions specify that if the event has occurred and the result is known, we should return the appropriate resolution code. There's no ambiguity here, so p4 isn't necessary. \n\nI ensure that all citations are correctly applied, referencing the relevant search results that confirm the Rockets' victory. No conflicting information is present in the sources provided. Therefore, the final resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
