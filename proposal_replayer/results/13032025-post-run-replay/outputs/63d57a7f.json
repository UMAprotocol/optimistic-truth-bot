  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741869457\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:37:37",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a market based on the outcome of the USC vs. Rutgers game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Rutgers, p2 for USC, and p3 if the game is canceled. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 13:36:21, which is the next day after the scheduled game. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as planned. The search results provided are all from March 12 or 13, 2025. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. [1] from the LA Times on March 13 reports that USC won in double overtime against Rutgers.\n2. [2] from SI.com on March 13 confirms Rutgers' loss to USC.\n3. [3] is a YouTube video uploaded on March 13 titled \"USC vs. Rutgers | BIG TEN TOURNAMENT HIGHLIGHTS | 3/12/25\" which shows USC's victory.\n4. [4] from NBC Right Now on March 13 also states USC's win.\n5. Other sources like [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10] are pre-game analyses or odds discussions but don't affect the outcome since the game has already occurred.\n\nThe key point is verifying the game's occurrence and result. All post-March 12 sources confirm the game took place and USC won. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. The detailed game reports, including scores and player stats, indicate the game was completed. Therefore, the market should resolve to USC, which corresponds to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
