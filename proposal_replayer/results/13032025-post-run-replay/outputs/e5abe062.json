  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741867600\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:06:40",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Saint Patrick\" during his press conference with Ireland's PM on March 12, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of Trump using the exact term \"Saint Patrick\" or its variations. The key here is to look for instances during the specified event. The resolution conditions state that pluralization or possessive forms count, but other forms don't. Also, the press conference is specifically mentioned, not preceding meetings.\n\nLooking through the search results:\n\n1. The Associated Press video transcript (1) shows Trump welcoming the PM for St. Patrick's Day celebration. He mentions \"St. Patrick's\" but not \"Saint Patrick\".\n2. ABC News articles (2,3) mention the St. Patrick's Day celebration, but again, Trump refers to it as \"St. Patrick's Day\", not \"Saint Patrick\".\n3. The YouTube video from Oneindia News (5) quotes Trump saying \"St. Patrick\u2019s Day meeting\", still using the abbreviated form.\n4. Search result 10 from Arab News includes a quote from Trump: \"happy St Patrick\u2019s Day\".\n5. The full remarks video (14) transcript shows Trump saying \"St. Patrick's Day\" multiple times but not the full \"Saint Patrick\".\n6. The St. Patrick's Day Reception transcript (15) has Trump saying \"happy St Patrick's Day\" again.\n\nIn all instances, Trump uses the abbreviated form \"St.\" rather than spelling out \"Saint\". The market's terms require the exact term \"Saint Patrick\". Since he only used \"St.\", which is an abbreviation, it doesn't meet the criteria as per the resolution conditions. Even though \"St.\" is short for \"Saint\", the market explicitly looks for the term \"Saint Patrick\". Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"No\".\n\nNow, I need to confirm if there's any mention of the full term in any source. After reviewing all provided contexts, there's no instance where Trump says \"Saint Patrick\" in full. All references are to \"St. Patrick's Day\". Therefore, the resolution is \"No\".\n</think>\n\n**Did Donald Trump Say \"Saint Patrick\" During the March 12, 2025 Press Conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin?**  \n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s March 12, 2025, engagement with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin centered on the annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations at the White House. The event included bilateral discussions, a ceremonial shamrock presentation, and public remarks. A critical analysis of available transcripts, press coverage, and video recordings confirms that **Trump did not use the phrase \"Saint Patrick\" during the press conference or related public interactions**.  \n\n### Context of the Event  \nThe St. Patrick\u2019s Day reception is a longstanding diplomatic tradition, emphasizing U.S.-Ireland relations. Trump\u2019s remarks focused on trade tensions, Ireland\u2019s economic policies, and lighter topics like Vice President JD Vance\u2019s shamrock-themed socks[1][2][6]. While Trump repeatedly referenced *St. Patrick\u2019s Day* (using the abbreviated form \u201cSt.\u201d), no verified instance of him uttering the full term *Saint Patrick* occurred during the press conference[1][5][10].  \n\n### Analysis of Verbal Statements  \n1. **Transcripts of Public Remarks**:  \n   - During the Oval Office meeting, Trump stated, *\u201cI just want to welcome you to Washington DC and to our country and thank you very much\u2026to celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s with you\u201d*[1].  \n   - At the evening reception, he remarked, *\u201cI want to be the first to wish each and every one of you a very happy St. Patrick\u2019s Day\u201d*[15].  \n   - In responses to reporters, he consistently used *\u201cSt. Patrick\u2019s Day\u201d* rather than the unabbreviated form[6][14].  \n\n2. **Media Coverage**:  \n   Outlets such as the *Associated Press*, *ABC News*, and *Arab News* documented Trump\u2019s remarks but did not note any usage of *Saint Patrick*[2][3][10].  \n\n3. **Specificity of Market Resolution Criteria**:  \n   The market\u2019s resolution hinges on the explicit utterance of *Saint Patrick*. While *St. Patrick\u2019s Day* is a direct reference to the saint, the abbreviated form does not satisfy the condition requiring the full term[1][2][6].  \n\n### Conclusion  \nBased on video evidence, transcripts, and media reports, Donald Trump exclusively used the abbreviated form *St. Patrick* during the March 12, 2025, press conference and related events. No instance of *Saint Patrick* was recorded.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
