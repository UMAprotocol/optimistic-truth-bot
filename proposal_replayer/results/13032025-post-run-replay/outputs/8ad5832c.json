  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741867951\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:12:31",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking about resolving a prediction market for the Cal Poly vs. UC Davis basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET. They need to know if the event has already occurred and whether the outcome is known so the market can resolve correctly.\n\nFirst, I check the current date and time provided: March 13, 2025, 12:12:26 PM UTC. The game was supposed to happen on March 12 at 11:30 PM ET, which is March 13 at 3:30 AM UTC. Since the current time is March 13, 12:12 PM UTC, the game should have already taken place. \n\nNext, I look through the search results to find evidence of the game's outcome. Search results [8], [10], [12], and [14] all mention that Cal Poly won the game against UC Davis with a final score of 86-76. These sources are from reputable outlets like CBS Sports, The Big West, and the UC Davis Athletics website, which adds credibility to the report.\n\nThe user's resolution conditions state that if Cal Poly wins, the market resolves to p2. Since multiple sources confirm Cal Poly's victory, the correct resolution is p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 and p4 aren't applicable here. All conditions are met to conclude that the market should resolve to Cal Poly.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
