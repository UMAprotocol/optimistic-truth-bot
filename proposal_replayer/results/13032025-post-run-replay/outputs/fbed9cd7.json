If the area is not shaded red by June 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOnce Russia captures the railroad station, any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.\n\nTrain Station Location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sudzha+train+station.png\n\nSudzha Location: https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sudzha+location.jpeg\n\nLocation on Google maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/s7MXZ3FSQBaVkAMk9\n\nThe primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the query and the provided search results. The user is asking whether Russia will recapture the Sudzha railroad station by June 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of Sudzha. From the search results, several sources indicate that as of March 12-13, 2025, Russian forces have seized Sudzha. For example, source [2] from ISW states that Russian forces captured Sudzha on March 12. Source [3] from DeepStateMap also shows that Ukrainian forces have withdrawn, leaving Sudzha under Russian control. Additionally, source [17] mentions Russia's official claim of recapturing Sudzha on March 13. \n\nNext, I need to confirm the location of the railroad station. The user provided a Google Maps link, but the search results include a mention of Privokzal'naya Ploshchad in source [4], which is a bus station in Tambov, but that might be a red herring. However, source [10] and [11] discuss Sudzha's strategic importance due to railways, indicating the railroad station's significance. The ISW maps in sources [2], [5], and [16] detail Russian advances around Sudzha, including the industrial areas and key infrastructure.\n\nSince the railroad station's control is determined by the ISW map shading it red, and current reports (as of March 13) confirm Russian control of Sudzha, it's likely the station is under Russian control. However, the user's query specifies the resolution date as June 30, so I need to check if the current control is likely to hold. The search results don't mention any Ukrainian counterattacks retaking Sudzha after March 13. Instead, sources [18] and [17] suggest continued Russian consolidation and clearing operations. \n\nThe ISW's March 12 report (source [2]) also mentions Russian forces conducting clearing operations, which implies they are securing the area. Unless there's a significant change before June 30, the current control should persist. Therefore, based on the information available up to March 13, 2025, and assuming no major shifts, the answer should be p2 (Yes). \n\nHowever, I need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Source [1] and [6] describe earlier Russian attempts using gas pipelines, but subsequent sources confirm their success. Source [18] mentions Ukraine's potential withdrawal, aligning with Russian control. There's no indication of a negotiated settlement; the control is through military action. \n\nThus, the final recommendation is p2: Yes.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
