  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741871465\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 14:11:05",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Hornets vs. Hawks game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The key here is to determine if the event has already occurred and what the result was. \n\nFirst, I check the current date and time provided: March 13, 2025, 14:09:39. The game was supposed to happen on March 12 at 7:30 PM ET. Since the current time is the next day, the game should have already taken place. Now, I need to verify the result using the search results provided.\n\nLooking through the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Search result [1] from YouTube mentions the Hawks defeated the Hornets 123-110. Another source, [4], details Trae Young's performance leading the Hawks to a 123-110 victory. Additionally, [6] and [7] both corroborate the final score. The ESPN recap in [10] also states the Hawks won 123-110. All these sources are consistent and reliable, indicating that the game was played as scheduled and the Hawks emerged victorious.\n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the search results. All reports discuss the game's details, player stats, and post-game analysis, which wouldn't be present if the game hadn't occurred. Therefore, the event happened, and the Hawks won. \n\nSince the resolution conditions specify that if the Hawks win, the answer is p1. All evidence points to a Hawks victory, so the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
