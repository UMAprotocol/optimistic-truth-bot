  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741869951\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:45:51",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Real Madrid or Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid will advance in the UCL Round of 16. According to the resolution conditions, p2 is Real Madrid advancing, p1 is Atl\u00e9tico, and p3 is a 50-50 split if the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time provided in the personalization section. It's March 13, 2025, 13:45:07. The match in question took place on March 12, 2025, as per the search results. Since the event has already occurred, I don't need to worry about future dates here.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm that Real Madrid won the match. For example, source [1] mentions Real Madrid advanced via a penalty shootout after a 1-0 loss in the second leg, leading to a 2-2 aggregate. The penalty score was 4-2 in favor of Real Madrid. Similarly, source [2] and [6] also report Real Madrid's victory in the penalty shootout. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of the match being canceled or postponed. All sources reference the match taking place on March 12, so it wasn't postponed. The resolution conditions state that if the match is canceled or postponed beyond the end of 2025, it resolves to p3. Since the match happened as scheduled, this condition doesn't apply.\n\nNext, check the official UEFA Champions League information. The search results cite sources like ESPN, CBS Sports, and others that typically report official outcomes. There's no conflicting information among the sources; all agree Real Madrid advanced. \n\nA potential point of confusion might be the disallowed penalty for Atl\u00e9tico during the shootout mentioned in [1] and [8], but that doesn't affect the outcome since the result is confirmed. The official result from UEFA would reflect Real Madrid's advancement, which aligns with the sources provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence from the search results and the current date being after the match date, the correct resolution is p2 (Real Madrid). The answer should conclude with \"recommendation: p2\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
