  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741867411\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:03:31",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Knicks vs. Trail Blazers game scheduled for March 12 at 10:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins, if the game is postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually happened on that date. The current date provided is March 13, 2025, so the game should have already taken place. Looking at the search results, there's a result from March 13, 2025, where the Knicks beat the Trail Blazers in overtime with a buzzer-beater by Mikal Bridges [1][4][5][8]. That's a clear indication the game occurred and the Knicks won. \n\nNext, I should verify if there were any postponements or cancellations. The search results mention a game between the Mavericks and Trail Blazers that had its start time moved up due to weather in January 2025 [2], but that's a different game. Another result from January 15, 2025, talks about rescheduled games, including a Wizards vs. Trail Blazers game moved to March 17 [6], but again, that's not the March 12 game in question. \n\nThe key here is that the game in question (Knicks vs. Trail Blazers on March 12) is explicitly covered in multiple sources [1][4][5][8], all confirming the Knicks' victory. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation for this specific game. The other rescheduled games don't affect this one. \n\nAdditionally, Jalen Brunson's social media post after the game [5] and the YouTube highlights [4][8] further corroborate that the game was played as scheduled. Since the game was completed with a Knicks win, the market should resolve to \"Knicks,\" which corresponds to p2. \n\nI should also check the current timestamp to ensure the game wasn't in the future relative to the query time. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 13:02:46, so the game on March 12 at 10 PM ET would have concluded before this time. No future events are involved here. \n\nTherefore, the resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
