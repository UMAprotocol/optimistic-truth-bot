  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865425\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:30:25",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the Islanders vs. Kings game scheduled for March 11, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event isn't in the future anymore. Now, need to verify the actual result of the game.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, multiple sources [1][2][4][6][7][9][10] report that the Los Angeles Kings defeated the New York Islanders 4-1 on March 11, 2025. The Kings' goals were scored by Gavrikov, Danault, Byfield, and Doughty. The Islanders' only goal was by Anders Lee. Additionally, two Islanders goals were disallowed due to goaltender interference challenges by the Kings, as mentioned in [1][4][6][11].\n\nAll sources confirm the Kings won, and there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The game was completed as scheduled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to \"Kings,\" which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
