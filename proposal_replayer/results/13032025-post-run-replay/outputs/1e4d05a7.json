  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to know if Donald Trump will invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House by March 31, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on credible reporting. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025. The deadline is March 31, so there's still time. But from the search results, it looks like Trump already invited them on February 25 and the Eagles accepted by March 10-12. \n\nLooking at the sources: \n- Source [1] from February 26 mentions Trump said he'd invite them. \n- Source [3] on March 10 says the Eagles accepted. \n- Sources [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] all confirm the acceptance and the scheduled visit in April. \n\nThe key points are: Trump extended the invitation on February 25, which is before March 31. The Eagles accepted, and the visit is set for April 28. Since the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the invitation is sent by March 31, and it was sent in February, this meets the condition. \n\nI need to ensure there's consensus in credible reporting. Multiple sources (Fox29, CBS Sports, The National Desk, GB News) confirm the invitation and acceptance. No credible sources contradict this. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nAlso, the user's personalization requires checking if the event is in the future. The invitation was already sent and accepted, so it's a past event. No issues here. \n\nFinal recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\n**The Philadelphia Eagles' White House Invitation: A Resolution of Factual Inquiry**  \n\nThe question of whether former President Donald Trump would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House following their Super Bowl LIX victory has been resolved definitively through verified reporting. Below is a comprehensive analysis of the events, contextual history, and resolution timeline.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Findings**  \nPresident Donald Trump formally invited the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House on February 25, 2025, following their Super Bowl LIX victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. The Eagles accepted the invitation on March 10, 2025, as confirmed by team spokespersons and White House officials. The visit is scheduled for April 28, 2025, marking the first time the Eagles will visit the White House during Trump\u2019s presidency. This outcome contrasts sharply with the team\u2019s 2018 decision to forgo a visit during Trump\u2019s first term, a move that resulted in the cancellation of the event by the administration. The resolution of this inquiry hinges on two critical milestones: the issuance of the invitation by March 31, 2025, and its confirmation through credible reporting. Both conditions have been met.  \n\n---\n\n### **Historical Context of White House Visits by Championship Teams**  \n\n#### **Origins of the Presidential Tradition**  \nThe tradition of championship sports teams visiting the White House dates to 1865, when President Andrew Johnson hosted the Brooklyn Atlantics baseball team[7]. However, the modern iteration began under President Jimmy Carter, who welcomed the Pittsburgh Steelers after their 1980 Super Bowl XIV victory[1][7]. This practice became a hallmark of celebrating athletic achievement while fostering dialogue between athletes and political leaders.  \n\nDuring Donald Trump\u2019s first term (2017\u20132021), the tradition became politicized amid debates over national anthem protests and racial justice advocacy by athletes. Notably, Trump rescinded invitations to teams like the Golden State Warriors (NBA) and Philadelphia Eagles (NFL) after players indicated they would not attend[1][5][7]. Only one NFL team\u2014the New England Patriots\u2014visited the White House during Trump\u2019s first term[7].  \n\n---\n\n### **The 2025 Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl Victory and Invitation Timeline**  \n\n#### **Post-Game Developments**  \nThe Eagles\u2019 40-22 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on February 9, 2025, reignited debates about whether the team would accept a White House invitation. Initial speculation arose from a February 6 *U.S. Sun* article claiming the Eagles would decline the invitation[1][2]. However, this report was swiftly discredited by White House officials, league sources, and Eagles representatives[1][2][3].  \n\nOn February 25, 2025, Trump announced during a press briefing that he would extend an invitation to the Eagles, stating: *\u201cThey\u2019ll be extended that invitation\u2026 We\u2019ll do it right away. They deserve to be down here\u201d*[1][3]. The White House formalized the invitation later that day[3][5].  \n\n#### **Eagles\u2019 Acceptance and Scheduling**  \nBy March 10, 2025, the Eagles confirmed their acceptance through a team spokesperson[3][6][8]. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on March 12 that the visit would occur on April 28, 2025[5][7]. This marked a departure from 2018, when the team\u2019s reluctance to attend led Trump to cancel the event[1][5][7].  \n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Key Controversies and Misinformation**  \n\n#### **The *U.S. Sun* Report and Its Fallout**  \nThe February 6 *U.S. Sun* article, which alleged the Eagles would reject the invitation, relied on anonymous sources described as a \u201cmember of the ownership group\u201d and a \u201ccurrent player\u201d[1][2]. However, the report lacked corroboration and was contradicted by:  \n1. White House officials, who labeled it \u201cfalse\u201d[1][2].  \n2. NFL insiders, who confirmed the Eagles\u2019 intent to accept[1][2][5].  \n3. Eagles sources, who told CNN and *Axios* the team was \u201chonored\u201d to receive the invitation[2][5].  \n\nProgressive social media accounts amplified the *Sun* story, framing the Eagles\u2019 purported refusal as a stand against Trump[2]. This narrative collapsed once mainstream outlets verified the invitation\u2019s acceptance[3][5][8].  \n\n#### **Political Dynamics and Ownership Influence**  \nEagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, a Democratic donor, had previously clashed with Trump over social justice issues[7][8]. In 2018, Lurie criticized Trump\u2019s response to national anthem protests, calling his rhetoric \u201cdivisive\u201d[7]. However, Lurie\u2019s neutrality in 2025\u2014focusing on the game rather than politics\u2014signaled a pragmatic shift[1][8]. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s attendance at Super Bowl LIX, where he openly rooted for the Chiefs, did not deter the Eagles from accepting the invitation[1][5].  \n\n---\n\n### **Comparison to the 2018 White House Controversy**  \n\n#### **Cancellation of the 2018 Visit**  \nIn June 2018, Trump canceled the Eagles\u2019 visit after learning that fewer than 10 players planned to attend[1][5][7]. He attributed the decision to the team\u2019s purported refusal to \u201cstand for the National Anthem,\u201d though no Eagles players had knelt during the anthem that season[1][7]. The administration instead hosted a \u201cCelebration of America\u201d event, which excluded the team[7].  \n\n#### **2025: A Revised Approach**  \nThe 2025 acceptance reflects eased tensions between the NFL and Trump. League sources attribute this to the resolution of anthem protests through the 2020 collective bargaining agreement, which halted player demonstrations during the anthem[5]. Additionally, Trump\u2019s second-term outreach to athletes\u2014exemplified by the Florida Panthers\u2019 February 2025 visit\u2014created a more conciliatory environment[1][7].  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \n\nPresident Donald Trump invited the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House on February 25, 2025, and the team accepted the invitation on March 10, 2025. The visit is scheduled for April 28, 2025, as confirmed by White House and Eagles officials. This sequence of events, corroborated by multiple credible sources, satisfies the resolution criteria for the inquiry.  \n\n**recommendation: p2**",
