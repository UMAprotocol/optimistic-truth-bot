  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. Wait, but wait\u2014the event mentioned is actually between Donald Trump and Miche\u00e1l Martin, not Zelenskyy. That might be a typo in the query. Let me check the search results again.\n\nLooking at the search results provided (1 through 13), all of them discuss Trump's meetings with Ireland's Prime Minister Martin around St. Patrick's Day 2025. There are mentions of discussions about trade deficits, pharmaceutical companies, Ukraine ceasefire talks, and even some tariffs and AI investments by Trump earlier in January 2025 (sources [2], [6], [9], [10], [13]). However, none of these sources indicate that Zelenskyy was present at the March 12 press conference with Martin. In fact, source [4] mentions that Trump had a previous meeting with Zelenskyy which ended badly, but that was a separate event.\n\nThe key here is that the press conference in question is between Trump and Martin on March 12. The user might have confused Zelenskyy with Trump here. Since all available transcripts and summaries from that specific event (like sources [3], [4], [7], etc.) focus on topics like trade relations between the US and Ireland, Ukraine ceasefire discussions led by Trump and European allies\u2014there\u2019s no mention of AI or Artificial Intelligence being discussed during this particular presser.\n\nAdditionally, while there were prior announcements by Trump about AI investments in January (sources [2], [6]), those are separate events from the March 12 meeting with Martin. The transcripts from March 12 don't reference AI topics at all; instead they cover tariffs, pharmaceuticals trade deficits between US-Ireland-EU relations etc., as well as some lighter topics like Conor McGregor or Rosie O'Donnell moving to Ireland.\n\nTherefore based on available data up until current date given (March14th), there\u2019s no evidence suggesting either Zelenskyy spoke at this event nor did anyone use terms related to AI during it since focus was elsewhere entirely according to cited materials.\n</think>\n\nBased on analysis of available transcripts and reports from Donald Trump's March 12-13 St Patrick's Day events with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin:\n\n**No instances** of either leader using \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" appear in:\n- Full Oval Office meeting transcript excerpts[1][3][4][11]\n- Press conference coverage[7][8]\n- Evening reception remarks[1][4]\n\nThe discussions focused entirely on:\n1) **US-Ireland/EU trade disputes**, including pharmaceutical company taxation\n2) **Ukraine ceasefire negotiations** involving Russia\n3) Lighthearted exchanges about Conor McGregor/Rosie O'Donnell\n\nWhile President Trump announced major **$500B private-sector AI infrastructure projects** earlier in January[2][6][9][10][13], these weren't referenced during his interactions with PM Martin based on verified records.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
