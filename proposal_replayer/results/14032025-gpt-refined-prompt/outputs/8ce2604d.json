  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how the market will resolve based on the outcome of the Charlotte vs. Rice basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Rice, p2 for Charlotte, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, so the game date (March 12) has already passed. Let me look through the search results to find information about the game's outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [1] is titled \"49ers Rally to Defeat Rice 64-61 in First Round of AAC Tournament\" and dated March 12, 2025. The detailed recap confirms that Charlotte (49ers) won 64-61 against Rice. Similarly, result [7] from the American Athletic Conference's website also states Charlotte defeated Rice 64-61. Another source, [9], from Rice's own site, confirms the loss to Charlotte with the same score. Additionally, [17] and [18] provide further confirmation of Charlotte's victory.\n\nSince the game was played and Charlotte won, the market should resolve to p2 (Charlotte). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled; all sources indicate it took place as scheduled. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Charlotte 49ers defeated the Rice Owls 64-61 in the first round of the 2025 American Athletic Conference Men's Basketball Championship on March 12, 2025. The game was played as scheduled at The Super Pit in Denton, Texas, with Charlotte overcoming an 11-point halftime deficit to secure the victory[1][7][9][17]. Key performances included Nik Graves and Giancarlo Rosado each scoring 18 points, and Kylan Blackmon contributing 16 points, including 12 in the second half[1][17]. Rice led 34-23 at halftime but was held to 34.6% shooting in the second half and 1-of-13 from three-point range overall[9]. The outcome was decided in the final seconds, with Rosado making critical free throws and Rice failing to convert a last-second shot[1][7].  \n\nSince the game concluded with Charlotte winning, the market resolves to **Charlotte**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
