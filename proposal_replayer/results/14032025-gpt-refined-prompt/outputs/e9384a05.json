  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Northwestern vs. Minnesota CBB game scheduled for March 12 at 3:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Minnesota, p2 for Northwestern, and p3 if canceled or 50-50.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, so the game date (March 12) has already passed. Looking at the search results:\n\nSearch result [1] from ESPN mentions that Northwestern beat Minnesota 72-64 on March 12 in the Big Ten Tournament. Similarly, [3] and [5] confirm this score and outcome. Result [6] is a video highlight from NBC Sports also confirming Northwestern's win with Martinelli scoring 28 points.\n\nAll these sources are consistent about the result: Northwestern won. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation; all reports indicate the game took place as planned.\n\nSince the event occurred and Northwestern was declared the winner according to multiple reliable sources like ESPN and official team websites (gophersports.com), there's no ambiguity here. Therefore, according to resolution conditions, since Northwestern won, it should resolve to p2.\n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information or any indication that might suggest a different outcome or issues with scheduling\u2014none of which are present in provided results.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between Northwestern and Minnesota scheduled for March 12 at 3:30 PM ET concluded with **Northwestern defeating Minnesota** by a score of **72-64**[1][3][5]. Nick Martinelli led all scorers with **28 points**, while Dawson Garcia paced Minnesota with **22 points**[1][5]. Multiple verified sources including ESPN[1], NBC Sports highlights[6], and official team reports[5][8] confirm this result without any mention of postponement or cancellation events affecting its completion.\n\nBased on these verified outcomes meeting all stated resolution criteria:  \n`recommendation: p2`",
