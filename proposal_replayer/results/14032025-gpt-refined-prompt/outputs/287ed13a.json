  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Canadiens vs. Kraken game on March 12, 2025. The key here is to determine who won the game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results for the game's outcome. Looking at result [3], the ESPN recap clearly states the Kraken won 5-4 in overtime. Brandon Montour scored the winning goal just four seconds into OT. That's a decisive Kraken victory. \n\nResult [6] from The Hockey Writers also confirms the Kraken's 5-4 OT win, detailing Montour's quick goal. Similarly, result [8] mentions the Kraken overcoming a deficit to win 5-4, with Montour's record-setting OT goal. \n\nAll sources agree the Kraken won. The Canadiens led at one point but the Kraken came back. No mentions of postponement or cancellation, so the market should resolve to Kraken (p1). Need to make sure the game date matches the query. The sources all reference March 12, 2025, so the date is correct. \n\nTherefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens and Seattle Kraken played their scheduled NHL game on March 12, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. The Seattle Kraken won the game 5-4 in overtime, with Brandon Montour scoring the game-winning goal just four seconds into the extra period[3][6][8]. This outcome was achieved after the Kraken overcame a 4-2 third-period deficit, scoring three consecutive goals to force overtime[2][7]. The game was completed without postponement or cancellation[3][6].\n\nrecommendation: p1",
