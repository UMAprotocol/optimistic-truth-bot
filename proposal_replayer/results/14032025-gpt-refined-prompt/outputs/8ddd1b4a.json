  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the La Salle vs. Massachusetts game on March 12, 2025. The current date is March 14, 2025, so the game should have already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there are any sources confirming the result. Looking at the search results:\n\n- Source [3] from CBS Sports says La Salle won 78-71.\n- Source [4] from The Inquirer also reports a 78-71 win for La Salle.\n- ESPN's recap in source [6] confirms the same score.\n- UMass Athletics in source [12] states they lost to La Salle 78-71.\n- Other sources like [9], [10], and others also mention La Salle's victory.\n\nAll these sources are consistent and reliable, indicating that La Salle won the game. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation; all reports discuss the completed game. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions provided (p2 corresponds to La Salle), the market should resolve to p2.\n\nI need to ensure that none of these sources suggest any issues with cancellation or postponement. All articles refer to a completed first-round tournament game with a clear result. So there's no ambiguity here\u2014La Salle won definitively.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between **La Salle** and **Massachusetts** scheduled for March 12, 2025, at Capital One Arena concluded with **La Salle defeating Massachusetts by a final score of 78\u201371**[3][4][6][9]. Multiple verified reports confirm this outcome:  \n\n### Key Details  \n1. **Final Score**:  \n   - **La Salle**: 78 points[3][4][6].  \n   - **Massachusetts**: 71 points[3][4].  \n\n2. **Game Context**:  \n   - This was an Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament first-round matchup[3][9].  \n   - Corey McKeithan led La Sallle with a career-high *30 points*, including critical free throws late in regulation[4][6].  \n\n3. **Postseason Implications**:  \n   - The victory advanced No\\.14-seeded LaSallle (14\u201318) to face Saint Joseph\u2019s in the second round[3][9].  \n\n### Resolution Conditions Applied:\nSince Massachusetts lost and no evidence indicates cancellation or postponement ([all sources confirm completion](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/gametracker/recap/NCAAB_20250312_LSALLE@UMASS/)), this market resolves unambiguously under stated terms:  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
