  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Knicks vs. Trail Blazers game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Trail Blazers, p2 for Knicks, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date provided is March 14, 2025, so the game date (March 12) has already passed. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game's outcome. \n\nSearch result [1] from SI.com states that the Knicks won 114-113 in overtime with a buzzer-beater by Mikal Bridges. Similarly, result [3] from The Columbian and [5] from CBS Sports confirm the same score and outcome. The YouTube video in result [8] also highlights Bridges' game-winning shot. \n\nAll these sources are consistent: the Knicks won the game. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. Since the game was played and the Knicks won, the market should resolve to p2. The current date is after the game date, so there's no issue with it being a future event. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Knicks defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 114-113 in overtime on March 12, 2025, with Mikal Bridges hitting a game-winning buzzer-beating three-pointer[1][3][5]. The game featured 42 lead changes, the most in an NBA game this season, and Bridges led all scorers with 33 points[1][3]. Karl-Anthony Towns added 21 points for the Knicks, while Scoot Henderson's 30 points paced the Trail Blazers[3][5]. The outcome was decided conclusively with no indication of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][3][5][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",
