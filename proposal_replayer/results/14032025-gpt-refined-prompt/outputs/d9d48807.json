  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the LSU vs. Mississippi State basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Mississippi State winning, p2 for LSU, and p3 if the game is canceled or unresolved. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 12, 2025. Sources [1], [2], [3], [5], [8], [9], [10], and [11] all confirm that Mississippi State defeated LSU with a score of 91-62 in the SEC Tournament first round. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so there's no need for p3. \n\nNext, verifying the date and time. The sources consistently report the game occurred on March 12, which matches the scheduled date. The time isn't specified in the results, but since the event is in the past and multiple sources confirm the outcome, the exact time within the day might not matter here. \n\nLooking at the result details, Mississippi State won decisively. The final score and the fact that they advanced in the tournament are clear indicators. All relevant sources point to Mississippi State's victory, so the correct resolution should be p1. \n\nI also need to check if there's any conflicting information. All the sources from both LSU's and Mississippi State's official sites, as well as third-party sports news, agree on the outcome. No sources suggest a different result or any issues with the game being played. \n\nSince the game was completed as scheduled and Mississippi State won, the resolution is p1. The current date provided is March 14, 2025, which is after the game date, so there's no issue with it being a future event. \n\nTherefore, the final recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nMississippi State defeated LSU 91-62 in their SEC Tournament first-round game on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][3][5][8][11]. The game was played as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Since Mississippi State won decisively, the market resolves to their victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
