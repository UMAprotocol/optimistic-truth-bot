  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741870029\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:47:09",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to resolve this UMA oracle request based on the query and the provided search results. Let me start by understanding the query. The user is asking about the outcome of a college basketball game between Virginia and Georgia Tech scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are: if Virginia wins, it's p2; if Georgia Tech wins, p1; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 1:45 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. The search results include articles from March 12, 2025, which is the day of the game. Looking at result [1], it's a recap from CBS Sports stating that Georgia Tech beat Virginia 66-60 in the ACC tournament. The details mention Duncan Powell scoring 21 points, and Georgia Tech holding off a late rally. This seems like a post-game report. \n\nResult [5] from Sports Illustrated also confirms Virginia's loss to Georgia Tech in the ACC Tournament on March 12, 2025. It mentions the final score of 66-60 and discusses the implications for Virginia's season. Result [7] from the ACC's official site also reports Georgia Tech's victory, advancing to the quarterfinals with a 66-60 win. \n\nAdditionally, result [6] from Virginia's official sports site previews the game as happening on March 12 and result [7] confirms the outcome. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the search results. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled, and Georgia Tech won. \n\nSince the game took place on the scheduled date and Georgia Tech won, according to the resolution conditions, the correct answer should be p1. There's no ambiguity here; the sources are consistent and reliable. The final recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
