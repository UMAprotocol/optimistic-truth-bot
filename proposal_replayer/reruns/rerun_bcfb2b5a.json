  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741866911\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:55:11",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to resolve this UMA optimistic oracle request based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. The user wants to know the outcome of the NBA game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Boston Celtics that was scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on who won the game. If the Thunder won, it's p2; if the Celtics won, p1; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether the game actually took place and determine the result. The current date is March 13, 2025, so the game should have already happened. Let me check the provided search results for evidence of the game's outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [8], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]) mention the game occurred on March 12, 2025. The detailed reports in [1] and [2] state that the Thunder won 118-112. Specifically, [1] says \"Oklahoma City Thunder clinch a playoff berth by beating the Boston Celtics 118-112 on Wednesday night.\" Wednesday night would be March 12, given the current date is March 13. \n\nOther sources like [5] (ESPN) also list the final score as Thunder 118, Celtics 112. Video highlights in [4] and [6] corroborate the Thunder's victory. Additionally, betting sites like [13] and [15] post-game have the Thunder covering the spread, confirming their win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. \n\nAll the evidence points to the game being played as scheduled with the Thunder winning. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Thunder). No conflicting information or future dates are mentioned, so there's no reason to doubt the outcome. \n\nI should also check if any sources suggest a different result or any discrepancies, but all consistent reports confirm the Thunder's victory. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
