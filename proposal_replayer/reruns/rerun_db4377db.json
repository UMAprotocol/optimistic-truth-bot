  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741868927\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:28:47",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Vancouver Canucks vs. Calgary Flames game scheduled for March 12 at 9:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is 1741868857, which translates to March 13, 2025, at 13:27:37 UTC. That's the day after the game was supposed to happen. So the game should have already taken place. \n\nNext, I need to look at the search results to find out the actual outcome of the game. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. Search result [1] is from TSN and mentions the Canucks won 4-3 in a shootout against the Flames on March 12. Key details: Elias Pettersson tied the game late, and Conor Garland scored the shootout winner. The Canucks and Flames are both at 71 points, but the Canucks are outside the playoffs, while the Flames hold a wild-card spot with one less game played. This seems like a reliable source.\n\n3. Search result [3] from CBS Sports also confirms the Canucks' 4-3 shootout victory over the Flames on March 12. It details the goals, including Pettersson's tying goal and shootout contribution. Another reliable source.\n\n6. Search result [6] is another CBS Sports recap, reiterating the same outcome: Canucks won 4-3 in a shootout. So multiple sources confirm the Canucks won.\n\nOther search results like [2] discuss the Rangers' performance, [4] and [5] are PDFs unrelated to the game, and [7] has older game recaps from 2023. None of these are relevant to the March 12, 2025 game.\n\nBased on the consistent information from sources [1], [3], and [6], the Canucks won the game in a shootout. Since the market resolves to \"Canucks\" if they win, the correct resolution is p2. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. Even though the Flames got a point for the overtime loss, the market resolution is based on the outright winner, which is Vancouver. \n\nI need to make sure there's no conflicting information. All relevant sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The answer should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks defeated the Calgary Flames 4-3 in a shootout during their NHL game on March 12, 2025, as verified by multiple credible sports news sources[1][3][6]. The match occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Since the Canucks secured the victory, the market resolves to \"Canucks\" per the stated conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
