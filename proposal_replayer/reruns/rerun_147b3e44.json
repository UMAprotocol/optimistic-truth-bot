  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865751\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:35:51",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking about resolving a prediction market for the UT Arlington vs. Grand Canyon basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET. The current date and time given are March 13, 2025, 12:35 PM UTC, which is the next day after the game was supposed to take place. Wait, but the game was scheduled for March 12 at 11:30 PM ET. ET is UTC-4 or -5 depending on daylight saving. Let me check the time zones. March is during Eastern Daylight Time, so ET is UTC-4. So 11:30 PM ET on March 12 would be 3:30 AM UTC on March 13. The current timestamp is March 13, 12:35 PM UTC. That means the game should have already happened. \n\nLooking at the search results, the first result [1] from CBS Sports is a recap of the game where Grand Canyon beat UT Arlington 98-75 in the WAC Tournament quarterfinal on March 12. The article mentions the final score and key players. So the game did take place, and Grand Canyon won. \n\nThe other sources, like [5] and [6], also mention the game happening on March 12, and [7] from Fox Sports has a box score dated March 12, 2025, confirming the result. The user's personalization instructions say to check if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp. Since the game was scheduled for March 12 at 11:30 PM ET (which is March 13, 3:30 AM UTC), and the current time is March 13, 12:35 PM UTC, the game has already occurred. \n\nTherefore, the resolution should be based on the actual outcome. The recap in [1] clearly states Grand Canyon won 98-75. All other sources, including [5], [6], and [7], corroborate that the game happened as scheduled with Grand Canyon's victory. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. Hence, the market should resolve to Grand Canyon, which corresponds to p1. The user's instructions say to return p4 only if the event is in the future. Since it's past the event time and the result is known, the answer is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
