  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865304\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:28:24",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for a market on the outcome of a college basketball game between La Salle and Massachusetts scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 4:30 PM ET. The key here is to determine whether the event happened as scheduled, if there was a winner, or if it was postponed or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The user provided the current Unix timestamp as 1741865210, which converts to March 13, 2025, at 12:26:50 PM UTC. The game was supposed to take place on March 12, 2025, at 4:30 PM ET, which is 8:30 PM UTC. Since the current time is March 13, the game should have already occurred. \n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to see if there's information confirming the game's outcome. Search result [9] from CBS Sports and [13] from goexplorers.com both report that La Salle defeated Massachusetts with a final score of 78-71. These are reputable sources, and the detailed box scores and play-by-play data support the conclusion that the game took place as scheduled and La Salle won. \n\nAdditionally, search result [14] from Dimers.com initially predicted a Massachusetts win but also includes a link to their prediction page, which might have been updated post-game. However, the CBS Sports article is a direct post-game recap, which is a primary source confirming the result. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the search results. Other search results like [6] discuss NFL game cancellations, but that's irrelevant here. The user's resolution conditions state that if the game is completed, the market resolves based on the winner. Since multiple sources confirm La Salle's victory, the correct resolution is p2 (La Salle). \n\nI must ensure that the event wasn't postponed or canceled. All provided context points to the game occurring on the scheduled date with a clear outcome. Therefore, the market should resolve to La Salle.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
