  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741868739\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:25:39",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say the term \"Trans\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. Wait, but the ancillary data mentions Donald Trump holding the press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, not Zelenskyy. That might be a mix-up. Let me check the search results again.\n\nLooking at the search results provided, most of them are about Trump's meetings with the Irish PM, not Zelenskyy. However, there is one result [8] where Zelenskyy held a press conference with Martin in February 2025. But the query specifically refers to the March 12 event with Trump. So, the key here is whether Trump used the term \"Trans\" during his March 12 press conference or related events.\n\nThe search results include several instances where Trump discussed transgender issues. For example, in [6], he talked about men in women's sports and transgender topics. In [10] and [11], there are mentions of Trump's executive orders on gender recognition and transgender policies. Result [13] specifically discusses Trump's ban on transgender athletes in schools, signed in February 2025. Additionally, [12] and [16] include transcripts where Trump mentions transgender issues during the St. Patrick's Day events.\n\nNow, the resolution conditions state that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Trump says \"Trans\" during the scheduled press conference. The term \"Trans\" in any form (plural, possessive) counts, but other forms do not. The event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET on March 12, as per the update.\n\nLooking through the transcripts from that day's events, in [2], Trump discusses transgender issues, specifically mentioning \"transgender\" multiple times. For example, he says, \"everything's transgender everybody transgender that's all you hear about uh now...\" which includes the term \"transgender\". The exact term \"trans\" isn't used, but \"transgender\" is a compound form. According to the rules, compound words count if they include the term, so \"transgender\" would count as containing \"trans\".\n\nHowever, the market's resolution depends on the exact term \"Trans\" being spoken. The user specified that only the specific term \"Trans\" counts, not variations like \"transgender\". Wait, the query says: \"Any usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market. Pluralization/possessive of the term will count, however other forms will NOT count. Instances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context...\"\n\nSo, \"transgender\" is a compound word containing \"trans\", so according to the rules, that should count. Therefore, if Trump said \"transgender\", that would qualify as using \"trans\" in a compound word, thus resolving to \"Yes\".\n\nChecking the transcripts again: In [6], Trump says, \"everything's transgender everybody transgender that's all you hear about uh now...\" Here, \"transgender\" is used multiple times. Since \"transgender\" contains \"trans\" as a compound, this meets the criteria. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
