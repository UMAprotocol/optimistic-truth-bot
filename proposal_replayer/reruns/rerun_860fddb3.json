  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741866208\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:43:28",
  "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to resolve whether Trump said \"Ukraine\" five or more times during his March 12, 2025 press conference with Ireland's PM Miche\u00e1l Martin. \n\nFirst, check the current date and time: March 13, 2025, 12:39:58 PM. The event was scheduled for March 12, so it has already occurred. Now, I need to review the provided search results for mentions of Ukraine during the press conference.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. Source [1] mentions Trump discussed sending a team to Russia regarding a Ukraine ceasefire during his meeting with Martin. However, this is part of their Oval Office meeting, not the press conference.\n2. Source [2] quotes Martin praising Trump's efforts for a Ukraine ceasefire, but again, this is from the bilateral meeting.\n3. Source [3] covers the St. Patrick's Day event but focuses on trade issues, not mentioning Ukraine in the press conference context.\n4. Source [4] is a CBS News video about the meeting, but no transcript is provided.\n5. Source [5] discusses the Irish PM navigating divisions on Ukraine but doesn't specify the press conference.\n6. Source [6] (Hindustan Times video) mentions Martin hailing Trump's peace efforts in Ukraine during the shamrock ceremony, which might be part of the press event.\n7. Source [7] details Trump's comments on trade and the EU but doesn't mention Ukraine in the presser.\n8. Source [8] quotes Trump discussing NATO's role in Ukraine, but this is from the Oval Office meeting, not the press conference.\n9. Source [13] mentions Martin's visit post-Zelenskyy meeting and Ukraine ceasefire talks, but the press conference specifics aren't clear.\n10. Source [17] explicitly states that during remarks in front of the media (press conference), Trump said it's up to Russia to decide on a Ukraine ceasefire. This indicates at least one mention of Ukraine.\n11. Other sources like [10], [12], [15], [16] discuss Trump's interactions with Ukraine but in different contexts or earlier meetings.\n\nThe key source here is [17], which directly quotes Trump mentioning Ukraine in his remarks to the media during the event. The resolution conditions specify that only the scheduled press conference counts, not preceding meetings. However, the provided updates note that the resolution is based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET, which is the press conference in question.\n\nFrom [17]: \"During remarks in front of the media, Trump said it is now up to Russia to decide whether there will be a ceasefire in the war with Ukraine.\" This is one mention. \n\nBut to reach five mentions, I need more evidence. Other sources don't provide specific counts. Since the search results don't include a full transcript of the press conference, it's challenging to verify exact mentions. However, based on the available data, only one explicit mention is documented. Without further evidence of four more mentions, the answer is likely \"No.\"\n\nAdditionally, the user's personalization requires checking if the event is in the future. Since the event occurred on March 12, 2025, and the current time is March 13, it's in the past. Therefore, the resolution depends on factual occurrence. Given the lack of evidence for five mentions, the answer is \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
