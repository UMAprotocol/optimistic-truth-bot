  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865210\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:26:50",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query and the provided context. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of a basketball game between Coppin State and South Carolina State scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if SC State wins, it's p1; if Coppin State wins, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date and time given are March 13, 2025, 12:25:46 PM UTC, which is the next day after the game. Looking at the search results, especially results [6], [7], and [8], they all mention that the game took place on March 12, with South Carolina State winning 68-63. These sources are from reputable domains like ESPN, meacsports.com, and wtop.com, which adds credibility. \n\nResult [6] from meacsports.com, the official MEAC site, provides a detailed recap of the game, confirming SC State's victory. The ESPN recap [7] and the AP article on wtop [8] both corroborate the final score and outcome. Additionally, the betting previews [1], [2], [9], [10], [11], [12] all reference the game being scheduled for March 12, and the post-game results confirm it happened. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. None of the search results indicate any postponement or cancellation. All sources that discuss the game after March 12 report it as completed. The MEAC tournament bracket in result [4] lists the game as part of the quarterfinals, and result [6] confirms it was played. \n\nThe user's personalization instructions emphasize that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, resolve to p4. However, the current timestamp is March 13, 2025, which is after the game's scheduled time. Therefore, the event has already occurred. Since the game was played and SC State won, the correct resolution is p1. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All post-March 12 sources confirm the result. No sources suggest the game didn't happen or was inconclusive. Therefore, the market should resolve to SC State (p1) based on their 68-63 victory.\n</think>\n\n# Analysis of the MEAC Tournament Quarterfinal Game Between South Carolina State and Coppin State on March 12, 2025  \n\nThe Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament quarterfinal game between the second-seeded South Carolina State Bulldogs and the seventh-seeded Coppin State Eagles took place as scheduled on **March 12, 2025, at 8:00 PM EDT** at the Norfolk Scope Arena in Norfolk, Virginia.
