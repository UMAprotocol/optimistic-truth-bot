  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741867258\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:00:58",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"God\" two or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he used the term at least twice in that specific event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each relevant source to find instances where Trump mentioned \"God.\" \n\nLooking at the sources, the first mention is in source [17], which is a transcript from the St. Patrick's Day Reception. Trump talks about the historical event where Irish workers defended St. Patrick's Church during the War of 1812. He mentions that they had \"faith in God\" and repeats \"they had a big faith in God.\" That's two mentions right there. \n\nAnother instance is in source [12], where Trump refers to Conor McGregor and says, \"God speed Donald! God bless the United States.\" However, this seems to be from McGregor's past comments, not from the event in question. \n\nSource [11] discusses Trump's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast where he talks about bringing God back, but that's from February 6, 2025, which is before the March 12 event. \n\nSource [10] mentions Trump's comments about God counting votes, but that's from 2024, so it's not relevant here. \n\nSource [16] includes a part of Trump's speech where he says, \"they had faith in God\" and \"God will never do this to us,\" which matches the transcript in source [17]. \n\nAdditionally, source [7] has a transcript where Trump mentions \"faith in God\" twice during the same event. \n\nSo, combining these, it's clear that during the St. Patrick's Day Reception, which is the event specified, Trump used the word \"God\" at least two times. The exact quotes are \"faith in God\" and \"they had a big faith in God,\" both occurring in the context of the historical story he shared. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes,\" which corresponds to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
