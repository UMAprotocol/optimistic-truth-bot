  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741866771\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:52:51",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on whether Villanova or Seton Hall won their game on March 12, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The current date and time are March 13, 2025, 12:51 PM UTC. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the actual outcome of the game. The search results provided are from March 12 and 13, 2025, which is after the scheduled game time. Let's check the sources. \n\nLooking at result [1], the title says \"Villanova gets going in second half, puts away Seton Hall\" and mentions a 67-55 win. Similarly, [2] and [3] both confirm Villanova's victory with the same score. Source [4] from the Big East Conference also states Villanova won 67-55. The YouTube video in [7] and the Villanova University article in [10] also confirm the result. \n\nAll these sources are from after the game's scheduled time, so the event has occurred. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, which is after March 12, so the game is in the past. No sources mention a postponement or cancellation; instead, they all report the game as completed with Villanova winning. \n\nSince the game happened and Villanova won, the resolution should be p1 (Villanova). There's no indication of a cancelation or postponement. All sources corroborate the result without any discrepancies. Therefore, the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
