  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741870297\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:51:37",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about the resolution of a market based on the outcome of a college basketball game between Air Force and UNLV scheduled for March 12 at 7:00 PM ET. The current date and time provided are March 13, 2025, 1:51 PM UTC, which is the day after the game was supposed to take place. \n\nFirst, I need to verify whether the game actually occurred on the scheduled date. Since the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, I should check for any reports or sources that confirm the game's outcome. The ancillary data mentions that the market resolves to Air Force if they win, UNLV if they win, and 50-50 if canceled. \n\nLooking at the search results provided, there are several sources. The first source from the Mountain West Conference's official site reports the final score of the game as Air Force 72, UNLV 68. The second source from ESPN also confirms Air Force's victory with the same score. The third source from CBS Sports provides a recap of the game, detailing how Air Force secured their win. The fourth source is a tweet from the Air Force Athletics account celebrating the victory, and the fifth source from a local Las Vegas news outlet covers the game's outcome from UNLV's perspective, acknowledging their loss.\n\nAll these sources are from reputable outlets and consistently report Air Force's win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the game took place as scheduled and Air Force won, the market should resolve to Air Force, which corresponds to p2 according to the resolution conditions. \n\nI need to make sure there are no conflicting reports or indications of any discrepancies in the game's status. All sources agree on the outcome, so the resolution is clear. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
