  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865789\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:36:29",
  "response": "<think>\nAlright, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a market asking whether Borussia Dortmund or Lille will advance to the next round of the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. The resolution depends on the official outcome of their two-legged tie.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is March 13, 2025, 12:35 PM UTC. The second leg of the match between Lille and Borussia Dortmund was played on March 12, 2025, as indicated in multiple search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially [1], [2], [3], and others, it's clear that the second leg took place on March 12, 2025. The aggregate score after both legs was 3-2 in favor of Borussia Dortmund. The sources consistently report that Dortmund won the second leg 2-1, leading to a 3-2 aggregate victory. \n\nKey points from the search results:\n- The first leg ended in a 1-1 draw ([13]).\n- In the second leg, Lille scored first, but Dortmund came back with goals from Emre Can and Maximilian Beier ([1], [2], [3]).\n- The aggregate score was 3-2, confirming Dortmund's advancement to the quarter-finals where they will face Barcelona ([8], [9]).\n\nSince the event has already occurred (the match was on March 12, 2025, and the current timestamp is March 13, 2025), the result is known. There's no indication of the match being postponed or canceled. All sources confirm Dortmund's progression. \n\nTherefore, according to the resolution conditions where p2 corresponds to Dortmund advancing, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
