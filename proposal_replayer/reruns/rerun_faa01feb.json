Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by March 12, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThis market is explicitly about the scheduled press conference with Miche\u00c3\u00a1l Martin. Preceding bilateral meetings will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the press conference contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the press conference.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741869907\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:45:07",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say the word \"Letter\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution is binary: Yes (p2) or No (p1), with p3 for uncertain cases. The market specifically looks for the exact term \"Letter\" in any form (plural, possessive) or in compound words. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results to see if \"Letter\" was mentioned. Let's go through each result.\n\nLooking at the search results, most are about the meeting between Trump and Martin. The key events discussed are trade issues, tariffs, the EU, and some personal jabs like the Rosie O'Donnell comment. The transcripts from the press conferences and meetings (results 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 11, 14, 18, 19) don't mention the word \"Letter\" at all. They talk about topics like \"tariffs,\" \"pharmaceutical companies,\" \"St. Patrick's Day,\" and \"trade deficits,\" but no instances of \"Letter.\"\n\nResult 12 is a speech by Trump at the World Economic Forum where he mentions Ireland giving quick approvals but again no \"Letter.\" Result 13 mentions Rosie O'Donnell moving to Ireland, but again, no \"Letter.\" Other results discuss the EU tariffs and the meeting's context but nothing about a letter.\n\nSince all the provided transcripts and articles from the event don't include the term \"Letter,\" and no other forms or compounds of the word are present, the answer should be \"No.\" There's no ambiguity here because the term isn't used in any context during the specified event. Therefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
