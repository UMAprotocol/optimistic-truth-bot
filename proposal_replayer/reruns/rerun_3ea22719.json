  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741864608\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:16:48",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Russia will recapture Sudzha's railroad station by April 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. First, I need to check the current status of Sudzha. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mix of information. Result [1] from March 13 says Russia claims to have recaptured Sudzha. But result [8] mentions that Ukraine hasn't confirmed it yet. Then there's result [5] from Meduza on March 12 stating that Ukrainian troops have fully withdrawn, which suggests Russian control. The ISW reports, like [2] and [12], indicate that Russian forces have made significant advances and possibly taken Sudzha by March 12. \n\nWait, but the query's resolution date is April 30. The current date is March 13, 2025. So even if Russia has already taken Sudzha now, the market resolves based on the status by April 30. But the user's note says that once captured, any subsequent loss doesn't matter. So if Russia has control now, and the market is asking if they'll have it by April 30, then it's a yes. \n\nBut I need to verify if the railroad station specifically is under Russian control. The ISW map is the primary source. Search result [14] is a Russian map link, but I can't access it. However, result [12] from March 11 mentions Russian advances towards Sudzha's outskirts. Result [5] on March 12 says Ukraine withdrew, so Sudzha is under Russian control. \n\nSince the current date is March 13, and the event is whether Russia holds it by April 30, which is in the future. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date, even the same day but later time, return p4. Wait, no\u2014 the event here is whether by April 30, which is in the future. But according to the current data, Russia has already captured Sudzha. So the event (capture by April 30) is about a future date, but the capture has already happened. \n\nWait, the market resolves to Yes if Russia captures it by April 30. If they've already done so before April 30, then the answer is Yes. But the current date is March 13, and the reports indicate that as of March 12-13, Russia has taken Sudzha. So the condition is already met. However, the user instructions say that if the event is in the future, even if the same day but later time, return p4. But in this case, the event is a deadline (April 30), and the capture has already occurred. So the answer should be Yes (p2). But wait, the personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4\". But the event is \"by April 30\", and the capture has already happened. So the event's deadline is in the future, but the actual capture is in the past. \n\nWait, the market's resolution is based on whether the station is captured by April 30. If it's already captured now (March 13), then the answer is Yes. But the personalization says to check if the event is scheduled for a future date. Here, the event is the deadline, but the capture has occurred. So the answer is p2 (Yes), because the condition is already met. However, the user's note in personalization says that if the event is in the future, return p4. But in this case, the event's outcome is already determined. The market's resolution is based on the status by April 30. If the station is already under Russian control, then even though the deadline is in the future, the answer is Yes. So the resolution should be p2. \n\nBut I need to confirm if the railroad station is under Russian control. The search results mention Sudzha's recapture, but the specific station? Result [14] is about the railway station in Sudzha, but the content is in Russian and not accessible. However, result [12] mentions Russian forces attacking the outskirts and entering Sudzha, and result [5] says Ukraine withdrew. If Sudzha is under Russian control, the railway station likely is too. \n\nTherefore, based on current info, Russia has already captured Sudzha, including the railroad station, before April 30. Hence, the answer is p2 (Yes). But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. But here, the event is whether it's captured by a future date, but the capture has already happened. So the event's condition is already satisfied. Thus, the answer is p2. \n\nBut according to the user's instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date (even if the outcome is already known), but the resolution date is in the future, how does that work? The market resolves based on the status by April 30. Since the capture has already happened, and the condition is that once captured, subsequent loss doesn't matter, then the answer is Yes. Therefore, the recommendation is p2. However, the user's personalization requires checking if the event is in the future. Since the resolution date is April 30, which is in the future, but the capture has already occurred, does that count as a past event? The key is whether the event (capture by April 30) is considered a future event. Since the deadline is in the future, but the event (capture) has already occurred, it's a past event with a future deadline. The market's resolution is based on the status by that deadline. Since the capture has already happened, the answer is Yes. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2. But I need to ensure that the sources confirm the capture of the railroad station. The ISW reports (results [2], [12]) mention Sudzha's capture. The railway station is part of Sudzha. So it's safe to assume that if Sudzha is under Russian control, the station is too. Hence, the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
