  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741867033\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:57:13",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by figuring out what the user is asking. The query is about whether Donald Trump said the word \"Israel\" during his press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Prime Minister of Ireland, on March 12, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" if he didn't. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to see if any of them mention Trump using the word \"Israel\" during that specific event. The user provided several sources, and I need to go through each one to find relevant mentions.\n\nLooking at the sources, most of them discuss Trump's meetings with Martin, his comments on Gaza, and relations with Ireland. Let's check each source:\n\n1. Source [2] (JPost) mentions Trump's statement alongside Martin: \"No one is expelling anyone from Gaza.\" The article also discusses Israel-Ireland relations, but it's not clear if Trump said \"Israel\" during the presser.\n\n2. Source [4] (The JC) reports that Trump called Chuck Schumer a Palestinian and said he's not Jewish anymore during the meeting with Martin. He mentioned Israel in the context of being under siege and the October 7 attacks. The transcript includes Trump saying, \"Israel has been under siege...\" So here, Trump did use the word \"Israel\" during the meeting.\n\n3. Source [6] (VOA News) mentions Trump's meeting with Martin. The article states that Trump said, \"No one is expelling anyone from Gaza\" and that Martin called for a ceasefire. It also notes Trump's alliance with Netanyahu but doesn't directly quote Trump saying \"Israel\" during the press conference.\n\n4. Source [10] (JNS) quotes Trump during the meeting with Martin: \"Israel has been under siege...\" This directly includes the word \"Israel\" in Trump's statement.\n\n5. Source [11] (Times of India) mentions Trump referring to Chuck Schumer as a Palestinian and not Jewish anymore, but also quotes Trump discussing hostages and Israel: \u201cWe're working hard with Israel. We're working hard to see if we can solve the problem,\u201d which he said during the meeting with Martin.\n\n6. Source [13] (YouTube News9) reports Trump saying, \"nobody is expelling any Palestinians\" from Gaza during the press conference with Martin. The video's transcript includes Trump's mention of working with Israel: \u201cWe're working hard with Israel. We're working hard to see if we can solve the problem,\u201d which he stated during the event.\n\nPutting this together, sources [4], [10], [11], and [13] all indicate that Trump used the word \"Israel\" during his meeting/press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The exact context varies, but the key point is whether the term was spoken during the scheduled press conference. \n\nThe query specifies that the press conference includes any Q&A sessions. The instances where Trump mentions Israel, such as discussing Israel being under siege or working with Israel, occurred during the event with Martin. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Trump did say \"Israel,\" the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
