  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741869729\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:42:09",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to resolve this UMA optimistic oracle request based on the Fordham vs. Rhode Island basketball game that was supposed to happen on March 12, 2025. Let me start by checking the current date and time. The user provided the current Unix timestamp as 1741869633, which translates to March 13, 2025, at 13:40:33 UTC. That means the current date is March 13, 2025, which is the day after the game was scheduled.\n\nThe query is asking whether Fordham or Rhode Island won the game. The resolution conditions are p1 for Rhode Island, p2 for Fordham, and p3 if the game was canceled. The user also mentioned that if the event hasn't occurred yet, we should return p4. But since the game was scheduled for March 12, and it's now March 13, the game should have already taken place.\n\nLooking at the search results provided, there are several sources that report the outcome of the game. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nSearch result [5] is an article from ABC News dated March 12, 2025, stating that Fordham defeated Rhode Island 88-71 in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament. Jackie Johnson III scored 29 points for Fordham. This seems like a credible source.\n\nSearch result [7] from ESPN also reports the same score, Fordham 88-71 Rhode Island, with the game recap dated March 12, 2025. It mentions Jackie Johnson III's 29 points and Fordham advancing to play George Washington. ESPN is a well-known sports authority, so this adds credibility.\n\nSearch result [9] from the URI Athletics website confirms the loss, stating that Fordham won 88-71, ending Rhode Island's season. It's a direct source from one of the teams involved, so this is very reliable.\n\nSearch result [10] is another ESPN recap reiterating Fordham's victory with the same score and key players' performances. \n\nAdditionally, search result [8] from WTOP mentions the game preview, but the actual result is covered in the other sources. The URI Athletics site (result [9]) even details how the game unfolded, including key plays and player stats, which aligns with the other reports.\n\nThere's also a prediction in result [11] from Dimers.com that suggested Rhode Island might win, but the actual outcome contradicted this prediction, as Fordham won.\n\nAll the credible sources ([5], [7], [9], [10]) confirm that Fordham won the game on March 12, 2025. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled; all reports indicate it took place as scheduled. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2, which corresponds to Fordham winning. Since the event has occurred and Fordham is the clear winner, there's no need to consider p3 or p4 here.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
