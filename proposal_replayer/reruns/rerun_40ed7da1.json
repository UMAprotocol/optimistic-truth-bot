Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nNote: If Gruden accepts a position on an NFL team that is not \"Head Coach\", this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is official information from the NFL, any signing NFL team, and/or Jon Gruden and his official representative(s), however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741866853\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:54:13",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Jon Gruden has been announced as an NFL head coach for the 2025-26 season by March 12, 2025, 4:00 PM ET. Let's start by looking at the current date and time given: March 13, 2025, 12:52:51. Wait, the deadline was March 12 at 4 PM ET. The current timestamp is after that deadline. So if there's no announcement by the deadline, it should resolve to \"No\".\n\nNow, checking the search results provided. Most of the sources are from January 2025, talking about Gruden being a potential candidate. The latest one is from March 12, 2025, where Gruden mentions he still wants to return to coaching but doesn't confirm any position. The resolution sources are official announcements from NFL, teams, or Gruden himself. The search results don't mention any official announcement of him being hired as a head coach by the deadline. All the sources are speculative, discussing potential interest from teams like the Saints, Raiders, Cowboys, etc., but no confirmation. Gruden's lawsuit and past emails are mentioned as potential obstacles, but the main point is whether he was officially hired by the deadline. Since the deadline has passed and there's no evidence in the provided context of an official announcement, the answer should be \"No\", which corresponds to p1. Also, the user's note says if he's in a position other than Head Coach, it's \"No\". The latest info from March 12 is him wanting to return but no announcement. So recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
