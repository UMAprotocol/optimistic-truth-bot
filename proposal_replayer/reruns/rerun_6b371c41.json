  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741869069\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:31:09",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about resolving a prediction market based on the outcome of the Philadelphia 76ers vs. Toronto Raptors game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The current date and time given are March 13, 2025, 13:28:47, which is the next day after the game was supposed to take place. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually happened or if it was postponed or canceled. Looking at the search results provided, there are multiple sources indicating the game took place. For example, search result [1] mentions the Raptors beat the 76ers 118-105 on March 13, 2025. Wait, the game was scheduled for March 12, but the article is dated March 13, so that makes sense as a post-game report. Similarly, search result [9] from Sportsnet.ca also reports the Raptors' victory on March 13, 2025, with details of the game. There's also [10] from CBS News Philadelphia and [14] from SFGate, both confirming the Raptors won 118-105. \n\nAdditionally, search result [13] from thescore.com lists the game on March 12, 2025, and shows the final score with the Raptors winning. All these sources are consistent in reporting that the game occurred and that the Raptors were the victors. \n\nNow, the resolution conditions state that if the game is canceled or postponed, the market would resolve to p3 (50-50) if canceled entirely, or remain open if postponed. However, all the evidence points to the game having been played as scheduled. There's no mention in any of the search results of the game being postponed or canceled. In fact, the detailed game reports, including player statistics and quotes from coaches, strongly indicate the game took place on the scheduled date. \n\nTherefore, since the game was played and the Raptors won, the correct resolution should be p1 (Raptors). The user's personalization section emphasizes that if the event has occurred, the answer should be based strictly on verified facts. The multiple sources confirming the Raptors' win provide the necessary verification. \n\nI also need to ensure that the current timestamp (March 13, 2025) is after the game's scheduled time (March 12, 7:30 PM ET), which it is. Since the game was not postponed beyond 24 hours and was completed, the market should resolve based on the actual outcome. \n\nNo conflicting information was found in the search results regarding the game's status. All sources agree that the game happened, and the Raptors won. Therefore, the resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET was played as planned. Multiple verified sources confirm the Toronto Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers with a final score of 118-105[1][9][10][13][14]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by detailed post-game reports, player statistics, and coaching comments from both teams. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, the market resolves to \"Raptors\" (p1) if Toronto wins. Since the game concluded with a Raptors victory and met all necessary criteria for completion, the outcome is definitively determined.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
