  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865635\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:33:55",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know whether Club Brugge or Aston Villa will advance in the UCL Round of 16. The resolution conditions are p1 for Aston Villa, p2 for Club Brugge, and p3 if it's a 50-50 split. But first, I need to check if the event has already happened based on the current date, which is March 13, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are from March 12 or 13, 2025, and they all mention Aston Villa's victory. For example, result [1] says Aston Villa won 3-0, advancing 6-1 on aggregate. Result [5] confirms the final score and their progression to the quarterfinals. The YouTube transcripts and other sources also back this up, noting the red card for Brugge and Asensio's performance. Since the match was played on March 12, which is before the current timestamp of March 13, the event has occurred. All sources agree that Villa advanced. There's no indication of cancellation or postponement. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 for Aston Villa.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
