  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741866694\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:51:34",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by figuring out what the user is asking. They want to know whether the Butler vs. Providence college basketball game on March 12, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET resulted in a Butler win, Providence win, or if it was postponed or canceled. The resolution depends on the actual outcome of that game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 12:50 PM UTC, which is the day after the game was scheduled. So the game should have already taken place. Now, I need to look at the provided search results to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11) mention that Butler defeated Providence 75-69 in the Big East Tournament First Round on March 12, 2025. For example, source [1] states \"Butler knocks off Providence 75-69,\" and source [10] confirms the final score. The box score in source [4] shows Butler with 75 points and Providence with 69. The YouTube video in source [11] also highlights Butler's victory. All these sources are consistent and from reputable sports websites, the official Butler sports page, and a video highlight, which adds credibility.\n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game as having occurred on March 12 with a clear result. Since the game was played and Butler won, the market should resolve to Butler, which corresponds to p2. The user's resolution conditions state p2 is for Butler, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
