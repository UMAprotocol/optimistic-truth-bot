  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865935\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:38:55",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. Wait, but wait\u2014the query mentions Donald Trump holding a press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, not Zelenskyy. That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a typo? Let me check the details again.\n\nThe market title says Zelenskyy, but the description refers to Trump and Martin. The resolution conditions are based on Trump's press conference. The user might have mixed up the names. Regardless, the event in question is Trump's press conference with Martin on March 12, 2025. The task is to determine if Trump uses either term during that specific event.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the press conference happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 13, 2025, 12:36:29 PM UTC, which is March 13, so the event would have occurred on March 12, which is the day before. Now, looking at the search results, there are several sources about Trump's activities around that time.\n\nLooking at the search results, especially [3], [4], and [15], these mention Trump's meeting with Martin on March 12. The articles describe their discussions about trade, tariffs, and St. Patrick's Day celebrations. However, none of the articles mention Trump discussing cryptocurrency or Bitcoin during that specific event. The focus was on Ireland's economic policies, trade issues with the EU, and the traditional St. Patrick's Day exchange.\n\nAdditionally, the sources [1], [2], [5]-[14], and [16]-[19] discuss Trump's involvement with cryptocurrency, particularly his executive order on creating a Bitcoin reserve and the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. However, these events are separate from the March 12 press conference with Martin. The press conference on March 12, as per the sources, centered on bilateral relations, trade, and St. Patrick's Day, not digital assets.\n\nThe user's query specifies that the resolution is based on the press conference with Martin, not other events. Since the provided search results do not indicate any mention of \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during that particular presser, the answer should be \"No\". Moreover, the current timestamp is after the event, so if there were any mentions, they would likely be reported in the search results provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, Trump did not use the terms during the March 12 press conference with Martin. The resolution should be \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
