  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741867366\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:02:46",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Anaheim Ducks vs. Utah Hockey Club game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins the game. If Utah wins, it's p1; if Ducks win, p2; if canceled, p3 (50-50). But wait, the personalization section says to use p4 for future events. Wait, the current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 13:00:58 UTC, which is 1 PM UTC on March 13. The game was scheduled for March 12 at 10 PM ET, which is March 13 at 3 AM UTC. So the game already happened. Therefore, it's not a future event. So I need to check if the game took place and the result.\n\nLooking at the search results, especially [1] and [6], both mention the game on March 12, 2025. The LA Times article [1] and CBS Sports [6] both report that Utah won 3-2. The game occurred as scheduled, so there's no postponement or cancellation. The resolution should be p1 (Utah). \n\nWait, but the user's resolution_conditions say p1 corresponds to Utah, p2 to Ducks, p3 to 50-50. But the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, since the game already occurred (current time is March 13, 2025, after the game's scheduled time), the event is in the past. Therefore, the result is known, and the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI need to verify the sources. The search results [1] and [6] both confirm Utah's victory. Other sources like [9], [10], [11] are predictions before the game, but the actual result is in [1] and [6]. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed. The game was played, Utah won. Therefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
