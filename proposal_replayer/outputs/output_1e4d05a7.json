  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741846018\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 07:06:58",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by breaking down the query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House by March 31, 2025, based on the provided search results. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The current date is March 13, 2025, and the deadline is March 31, so there's still time, but the sources need to be checked for confirmation.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each search result to determine if an invitation was sent and accepted. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles (1,2,4,5,6,8,10,11,13,16) mention that the Eagles have already accepted the invitation. For example, source 1 states that the White House sent the invite and the Eagles accepted. Source 10 confirms the date is set for April 28. The key here is whether the invitation was extended by March 31. Since the invitation was sent on March 10 (source 1) and March 11 (source 2), well before the deadline, that should satisfy the condition. \n\nHowever, there were conflicting reports earlier. Source 3 and 14 mention rumors that the Eagles declined, but these were debunked. The White House clarified that the invitation was sent and accepted. Sources like 7 and 17 discuss the initial confusion but later confirmations. \n\nThe user's personalization notes that if the event is scheduled for a future date (after the current timestamp), it's still a future event. But the query is about the invitation being sent by March 31, not the visit itself. Since the invitation was sent in March, the answer should be Yes (p2). \n\nI need to ensure the sources are credible. Most are reputable outlets like CBS, Fox News, NBC, etc. The White House press secretary's statement (source 10) is a primary source. All evidence points to the invitation being sent and accepted before March 31. Therefore, the resolution should be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
