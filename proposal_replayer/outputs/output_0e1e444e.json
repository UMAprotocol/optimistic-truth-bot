  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741818831\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:33:51",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Donald Trump said \"Zelenskyy\" during his press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The user provided a bunch of search results related to the meeting between Trump and Martin. Let me go through these sources step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results, most of them are about the meeting between Trump and the Irish Prime Minister. The key points mention discussions about Ukraine, tariffs, and the St. Patrick's Day celebrations. The user wants to know if Trump used the specific term \"Zelenskyy\" during the press conference part of this event.\n\nThe search results include transcripts and articles from various news outlets. Let me check each one for mentions of Zelenskyy during the press conference. \n\nResult [1] is a CBS News video where Trump met with Martin. The transcript mentions Trump discussing Ukraine and the ceasefire, but there's no direct quote of him saying \"Zelenskyy\" during the press conference. He refers to the Ukrainian president but doesn't use the name explicitly here. \n\nResult [2] is a YouTube video of the bilateral meeting. The transcript includes Trump talking about Ukraine and mentions \"Zelenskyy\" in the context of previous meetings, but this is part of the bilateral meeting, not the press conference. The user specified that only the press conference counts, not preceding meetings.\n\nResult [6], [7], [9], [14], and [18] are articles from different news sources. They mention that Trump hosted Martin and discussed Ukraine, but none of them quote Trump saying \"Zelenskyy\" during the press conference. They reference the previous tense meeting with Zelenskyy on February 28 but don't indicate Trump used the name during the March 12 event.\n\nResult [15] from ABC News includes a detailed account of the Oval Office meeting. Trump mentions Zelenskyy in the context of their previous encounter, but again, this is part of the bilateral meeting, not the press conference. The press conference would be a separate event after their meeting.\n\nResult [16] is another CBS News video transcript where the reporter discusses the meeting. The focus is on the ceasefire and Trump's comments about Ukraine, but again, no direct mention of Trump saying \"Zelenskyy\" during the presser.\n\nResult [17] from Sky News mentions Martin being the first EU leader to visit since Zelenskyy, but it doesn't report Trump using the name during the press conference.\n\nThe key here is to differentiate between the bilateral meeting and the press conference. The user specified that only the press conference with Martin counts. The resolution conditions state that preceding bilateral meetings don't qualify. So even if Trump mentioned Zelenskyy during their private talks or other parts of the day, that wouldn't count unless it was during the scheduled press conference.\n\nLooking through all the sources, there's no mention of Trump uttering \"Zelenskyy\" during the press conference itself. The discussions about Ukraine and the ceasefire are present, but without the specific name being used in the presser. Therefore, based on the provided information, the answer should be \"No,\" which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
