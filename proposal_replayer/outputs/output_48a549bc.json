  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741782396\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 13:26:36",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the NHL game between the New York Islanders and the Los Angeles Kings on March 11, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Kings, p2 for Islanders, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current timestamp is March 12, 2025, 13:25:21, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the game should have taken place. Now, I'll look at the provided search results to determine the actual outcome.\n\nLooking through the search results, multiple sources [1][2][3][5][7] report that the Los Angeles Kings won the game 4-1. The Kings' goals were scored by Danault, Byfield, Gavrikov, and Doughty. The Islanders had two goals disallowed due to goalie interference, as mentioned in [1][2][3][8]. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so there's no need to consider p3. \n\nAll sources consistently confirm the Kings' victory, and there's no conflicting information. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Kings). The user's instruction to check if the event is in the future doesn't apply here since the game has already happened. The final recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
