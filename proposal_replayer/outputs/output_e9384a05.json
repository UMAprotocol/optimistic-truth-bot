  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741815266\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 22:34:26",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking about resolving a prediction market for the Northwestern vs. Minnesota game scheduled for March 12, 2025. The key here is to determine if the event has already occurred based on the current timestamp provided, which is March 12, 2025, 22:32:30 UTC (which would be 10:32 PM UTC). The game is scheduled for 3:30 PM ET, which is 19:30 UTC. So, the current time is after the scheduled game time. \n\nNext, I need to check the search results for any information about the game's outcome. Looking through the provided sources, especially the live score updates from ESPN and The Score (sources 15 and 16), the game is listed as in progress with a live score showing Northwestern leading 32-27 in the first half. However, the final score isn't available in the search results provided. The most recent information from source 16 shows the game happening on March 12, 2025, with the score at 32-27 for Northwestern in the first half. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the game was scheduled to take place and the current time is after the scheduled start, but there's no conclusive final result in the provided context, I might need to infer. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But in this case, the event's scheduled time (3:30 PM ET on March 12) has already passed based on the current timestamp (10:32 PM UTC same day). So the event should have occurred. \n\nBut the search results don't provide the final outcome. However, the ancillary data specifies that if the game is postponed or canceled, resolve accordingly. Since there's no indication of postponement or cancellation in the search results, and the game was in progress according to source 16, it's likely the game was completed. However, without the final result in the provided context, the assistant might not have access to the actual outcome. \n\nBut wait, looking at source 15 (ESPN's live score), the data is marked as \"currently unavailable,\" which might mean the game is ongoing or the result isn't updated yet. However, source 16 from The Score shows the game in progress with a live score, but the assistant's knowledge cutoff is the provided search results, which don't include the final result. Since the resolution conditions require knowing who won, and the provided context doesn't have the final score, the assistant can't definitively determine the outcome. \n\nHowever, according to the user's personalization instructions, if the event has already occurred (as per the timestamp), the assistant should resolve based on verified facts. But given that the search results don't provide the final result, the assistant might have to default to p3 (50-50) if the result isn't available. However, the instructions also state that if the event is in the past and can be verified, it should resolve accordingly. The confusion here is whether the provided context includes the final result. Since the latest info is the live score in progress but no conclusion, perhaps the assistant can't verify the outcome and thus can't resolve to p1 or p2. However, the user's instructions say to answer based strictly on verified facts. If the search results don't include the final result, the assistant might have to resolve as p3. But wait, the user's instructions also mention that if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the timestamp, return p4. In this case, the event's scheduled time has passed, so it's not a future event. Therefore, the assistant must check if the event occurred and has a result. Since the search results don't provide the final result, but the game was in progress, perhaps the assistant can't confirm the outcome and thus would have to resolve as p3. However, the user's instructions might require a strict approach: if the event has occurred but the result isn't available in the provided sources, the assistant can't assume and must resolve as p3. Alternatively, if the game was completed but the result isn't in the provided context, the assistant should answer based on existing knowledge. However, the assistant is restricted to the provided search results. \n\nWait, looking again, the current timestamp is March 12, 2025, 22:32:30 UTC. The game was scheduled for March 12, 3:30 PM ET, which is 19:30 UTC. So the game should have ended by the current timestamp. However, the search results don't include the final score. The most recent info is from source 16, which shows the game in progress but not concluded. Without the final result in the provided context, the assistant can't verify the outcome. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, if the game isn't completed and the result isn't known, but the game wasn't postponed or canceled, it's unclear. However, the user's instructions state that if the event is in the past and the result can't be verified, perhaps it's considered unknown. But the instructions emphasize that the assistant must resolve based strictly on verified facts. Since the provided search results don't include the final outcome, the assistant can't confirm who won, so the resolution would be p3. However, the user's personalization says that if the event is in the future, resolve p4. Since the event is in the past (based on timestamp), but the result isn't available, perhaps p3 is the correct resolution. \n\nBut wait, the ancillary data says if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled, resolve 50-50. Since there's no info on postponement or cancellation, but the game was played (as per live score in progress), but the final result isn't in the provided sources, the assistant can't determine the winner. Therefore, the resolution would be p3. However, the user's instructions might require checking if the event occurred and if the result is known. If the result isn't known, but the event has occurred, the assistant might have to answer based on available data. But in this case, the data is incomplete. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant should check if the game was indeed played. The search results include a source (16) that shows the game is ongoing, but no final result. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled end, but no final score is provided, the assistant can't verify the outcome. Therefore, the resolution would be p3. However, the user's instructions say that if the event has occurred and the result is known, resolve accordingly. If not, and it's in the past but no result, perhaps p3. \n\nBut considering the user's strict instructions to only resolve based on verified facts, and the provided context doesn't include the final result, the assistant must conclude that the outcome isn't verifiable from the given data. Hence, the recommendation is p3.\n\nrecommendation: p3\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",
