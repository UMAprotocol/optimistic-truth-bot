  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741833054\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 03:30:54",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how the UMA optimistic oracle should resolve a market based on the outcome of the Sabres vs. Red Wings game scheduled for March 12, 2025. The current date is March 13, 2025, so the game should have already happened. But wait, the timestamp is 2025-03-13 03:28:21, which is early morning. The game was scheduled for March 12 at 7:30 PM ET. Since March 12 has passed, I need to check if the game occurred or was postponed/canceled.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game on March 12, 2025. Result [1] from ESPN shows a final score of Sabres 7-3 Red Wings. Similarly, [3] from NHL.com confirms the Sabres won 7-3. There's also a box score in [7] and a YouTube highlight [14] that corroborate the Sabres' victory. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as the detailed stats and reports are available. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Sabres\" (p2). However, there's conflicting info in [15] and [16] where the score is listed as Red Wings 7-3 Sabres. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check those again. \n\nWait, [15] is from ESPN and shows the Red Wings winning 7-3, but [1] and [3] clearly state Sabres won 7-3. There's a discrepancy here. Need to verify which sources are accurate. The user provided multiple sources, some of which are conflicting. However, the majority of the search results, including official sites like NHL.com and ESPN, report the Sabres' win. The conflicting ESPN link [15] might be a typo or error in data entry. Since most reliable sources, including the NHL's official site, state the Sabres won, I'll go with that. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Sabres). Also, checking the date, the game was played on March 12, 2025, which is before the current timestamp of March 13, 2025. So the event has occurred, and the outcome is known. No postponement or cancellation mentioned in the provided data. Hence, the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
