  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741808335\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 20:38:55",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to resolve whether Borussia Dortmund or Lille will advance to the next round of the Champions League based on their Round of 16 match. The user provided search results from various sources, and I need to check if the event has already occurred and what the outcome was. \n\nFirst, looking at the dates in the search results. The current timestamp given is March 12, 2025, 20:37:32 UTC. The second leg match between Lille and Borussia Dortmund is scheduled for March 12, 2025, as per multiple sources like [1], [8], and [9]. The first leg ended in a 1-1 draw on March 4, 2025 [3][5][6]. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the second leg has already happened by the current time. The current time is 8:37 PM UTC on March 12, 2025. The match is scheduled to start at 11:15 PM IST (Indian Standard Time), which is 5:45 PM UTC. So, converting 11:15 PM IST to UTC would be 5:45 PM UTC. Since the current time is 8:37 PM UTC, which is after 5:45 PM UTC, the match should have already taken place. \n\nHowever, looking through the search results, all the provided context is about the build-up to the match, predictions, and first-leg analysis. There's no mention of the actual result of the second leg. The latest information in the search results is from March 12, 2025, but it's a preview article [8] mentioning that the match will begin at 11:15 PM IST (which is after the current timestamp). Wait, let me check again. The current time is 20:37 UTC (8:37 PM UTC) on March 12, 2025. The match is scheduled for 17:45 GMT (which is same as UTC) according to [9], so 5:45 PM UTC. Therefore, the current time is after the scheduled match time.\n\nBut none of the search results provide the actual outcome of the second leg. All the articles are previews or analyses before the match. Since the event's outcome isn't reported in the provided sources, and the user's personalization instructions state to only resolve based on verified facts, I can't confirm the result. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, it should resolve to p4. However, the match was scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 17:45 UTC, which is before the current time of 20:37 UTC. But without any sources reporting the actual result, I can't definitively say who advanced. The user's instructions say to rely strictly on verified facts from sources. Since the search results don't include the match outcome, even though the time has passed, I must treat this as unresolved. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the timestamp, return p4. Wait, the current time is after the event's scheduled time, but there's no data on the result. The instructions say if the event hasn't occurred yet, return p4. But in this case, the event time has passed, but there's no result available. The resolution conditions mention if the match is canceled or postponed beyond Dec 31, 2025, it resolves to p3. But since the match was scheduled for March 12 and there's no indication of postponement, but the result isn't available, perhaps it's considered unknown. However, per the user's instructions, if it's after the event time but no verified results are available, maybe still p4? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it.\" The user's query includes URLs, but none have the result. Therefore, since the event's time has passed but no result is available in the provided sources, and the resolution source is official UEFA info which isn't present here, the market can't be resolved yet. However, according to the user's instructions, if the event is in the past and no result is found, perhaps it's p3 (50-50). Wait, no. The resolution conditions say p3 is for canceled/postponed beyond Dec 31, 2025. Otherwise, the market should resolve based on the actual outcome. But without the result, but the event time has passed, how to handle? The user's instructions say to answer based strictly on verified facts. Since there's no verified result in the sources, and the event time has passed, but no info, perhaps the answer is p3. But the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". But in this case, the event was scheduled for a past time relative to the timestamp. However, since there's no result in the sources, maybe the system can't confirm and must default to p4. Wait, the current timestamp is March 12, 2025, 8:37 PM UTC. The match was at 5:45 PM UTC on the same day. So the event has occurred, but without sources reporting the result, the assistant can't confirm the outcome. The instructions say to answer based on provided search results. Since the search results don't include the match result, the assistant must state that the event hasn't occurred yet. Wait, but the event did occur based on the timestamp. However, the provided context doesn't include the result. Therefore, the assistant can't verify the outcome and must return p4 because the information isn't available. But according to the user's instructions, if the event is in the past but no sources are available, it's unclear. However, the user's instructions prioritize using the provided URLs. Since the URLs don't have the result, and the event time has passed, but the user's personalization says to return p4 for future events, but this is a past event with no data. This is a tricky situation. The correct approach here is to check if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp. Since the current time is after the match time, the event has occurred. However, without verified sources, the assistant can't confirm the result. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, if the match isn't reported and isn't postponed, but the result isn't known, perhaps it's unresolved. However, the user's instructions state to return p4 only if the event is scheduled for a future date or time. Since the event time has passed, but no result is available, this might fall under the \"unknown\" category, which would be p3. But the resolution conditions for p3 are if it's canceled/postponed beyond Dec 31, 2025. Since there's no indication of cancellation or postponement, maybe it's p3. Alternatively, since the event has occurred but no result is found, the assistant can't resolve it and should default to p4. However, I think the correct answer here is p4 because the system can't verify the outcome from the provided sources, and the user's instructions say to only use the provided context. Since the context doesn't include the result, even though the event time has passed, the assistant must treat it as unresolved and return p4. Wait, no. The user's instruction says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". Since the event time is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but the result isn't available, the correct response would be to check if the event has occurred. If it has occurred but no result is available in the sources, then according to the instructions, the assistant can't confirm and must default to p4? Or is it p3? The resolution conditions mention p3 is for 50-50 if canceled/postponed. Since the event has taken place but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the user's instructions prioritize using the provided sources. Since the sources don't report the result, the assistant can't confirm and must return p4. Wait, but p4 is for future events. Since the event is in the past, but no result is available, maybe the assistant should answer based on the latest available info, but all info is pre-match. Therefore, the assistant cannot confirm the outcome and must return p4 because the result isn't verified yet. Alternatively, perhaps the match is ongoing or the result hasn't been reported in the provided sources. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
