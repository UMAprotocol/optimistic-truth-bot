Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nNote: If Gruden accepts a position on an NFL team that is not \"Head Coach\", this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is official information from the NFL, any signing NFL team, and/or Jon Gruden and his official representative(s), however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741809772\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 21:02:52",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jon Gruden will be announced as an NFL head coach for the 2025-26 season by March 12, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The current date is March 12, 2025, 8:02 PM UTC, which is after the deadline. So the event's outcome should already be determined. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any official announcement from the NFL, any team, or Gruden himself about his hiring. The search results provided are from sources like Bleacher Report, Front Office Sports, and others. \n\nLooking at the search results, several articles from January 2025 mention that Gruden is expected to be a hot candidate. For example, result [1] says he's expected to be a candidate, and [3] mentions multiple teams considering him despite his past controversies. However, there's a later result from January 12, 2025 ([14]), which states that a week into the hiring cycle, Gruden's name hasn't emerged. Another from March 1, 2025 ([15]) mentions speculation about the Cowboys, but Jerry Jones didn't confirm anything. \n\nCrucially, there's no mention in any of the search results of Gruden actually being hired by March 12. The latest info is from March 12 itself, but the sources don't indicate any official announcement. Since the deadline has already passed and no official sources confirm his hiring, the answer should resolve to \"No\". \n\nAlso, even though there was interest, the absence of an official announcement by the deadline means the market resolves to \"No\". The ancillary data specifies that the resolution is based on announcements by the deadline, which hasn't happened here.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
