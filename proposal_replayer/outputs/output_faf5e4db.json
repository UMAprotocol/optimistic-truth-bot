  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741807541\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 20:25:41",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the South Carolina vs. Arkansas game on March 12, 2025, at 1 PM ET has already happened based on the current date and time provided, which is March 12, 2025, 20:23:22 (8:23 PM UTC). The user wants to know if the event has occurred and what the outcome was. If it hasn't happened yet, I need to return p4. \n\nFirst, let's check the time zones. The game is scheduled for 1 PM ET, which is Eastern Time. ET is UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving. Since March 12 is after the second Sunday in March (when daylight saving starts in 2025), the Eastern Time Zone would be UTC-4. Therefore, 1 PM ET would be 17:00 UTC (1 PM ET = 1 + 4 = 5 PM UTC). The current timestamp given is 1741807402, which converts to March 12, 2025, 20:23:22 UTC. That's 8:23 PM UTC. So 5 PM UTC (game time) is earlier than 8:23 PM UTC. Therefore, the game should have already taken place.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm if the game actually happened. Looking through the search results, several sources mention the game as upcoming on March 12, like result [3], [6], [9], [12], [15], which are all from March 12 or before, predicting the game. However, a few results might have post-game data. Let me check each result.\n\nResult [1] is a live score page from CBS Sports for the game on March 12, 2025. The URL suggests it's a live tracker, but the snippet mentions \"Playing the 16th seed in a 16-team tournament -- as ninth-seeded Arkansas will do Wednesday against South Carolina in the opening game of the Southeastern Conference tourney in Nashville -- seems like a good way to post an easy win.\" This is written on March 11, 2025, so before the game. The same content is in result [7].\n\nResult [10] is a box score from FOX Sports for the game on March 12, 2025. The URL includes \"game-boxscore-257943\" and the snippet shows a final score of South Carolina 80-66 Arkansas, but wait, looking closer, that's from March 14, 2024 (result [13] is from 2024, which might be a previous year's game). Wait, result [13] is from 2024, so that's not relevant here. \n\nWait, result [10] from FOX Sports shows a box score for the March 12, 2025 game, but the snippet lists the score as South Carolina 80-66 Arkansas. But the user's current date is March 12, 2025, and the game was scheduled for 1 PM ET (5 PM UTC). The current time in the query is 8:23 PM UTC, which is after the game would have ended. So if the box score is available, that indicates the game has concluded. However, result [10] might be a placeholder or incorrect data. Let me check the other results.\n\nResult [14] and [5] are unrelated (statistics conference and old TV show data). \n\nResult [16] from March 1, 2025, discusses South Carolina's previous win over Arkansas 72-53 on March 1, which was a regular-season game. The upcoming game is the SEC tournament on March 12.\n\nWait, result [10] shows a box score with South Carolina 80-66, but that might be a previous year's game mistakenly listed or a placeholder. Alternatively, perhaps the game did happen, and the result is available. However, most of the search results (like [3], [6], [9], [12], [15]) are previews or predictions for the March 12 game, suggesting that as of the time the search results were generated, the game hadn't occurred yet. But the current timestamp in the query is March 12, 2025, 8:23 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. Therefore, the game should have been played, and the result should be available.\n\nBut since the search results provided don't include any post-game reports (except possibly [10], which might be a mix-up), I need to verify. The user's personalization says to check if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp. Since the game was at 1 PM ET (5 PM UTC) on March 12, and the current time is 8:23 PM UTC on the same day, the game has already occurred. Therefore, I need to determine the outcome based on the provided search results.\n\nHowever, the search results don't include any post-game information except for the FOX Sports box score in result [10], which shows South Carolina winning 80-66. But this might be a different year's game. Wait, looking at result [13], which is from 2024, that's a previous season. The FOX Sports result [10] is from 2025. But the snippet in [10] shows a final score of South Carolina 80-66. However, other sources like [16] mention the March 1 game where South Carolina won 72-53. The March 12 game is a different one.\n\nWait, the user's query is about the March 12 game. If the current time is after the game, but the search results don't include the actual result (except maybe [10], which might be incorrect or a placeholder), how do I proceed? The instructions say to use the provided search results. If the search results don't have the actual outcome, but the current time is past the event time, I should check if the event occurred. Since the current time is past, but the search results don't have the result, perhaps the information isn't available, and I should return p4? But according to the personalization, if the event is in the past, I should resolve based on facts. But if the search results don't include the outcome, maybe the answer is p4 because the data isn't present. However, result [10] claims a score of 80-66 South Carolina. But is that accurate?\n\nWait, looking at result [10] in detail: The URL is for the March 12, 2025 game, and the snippet shows \"South Carolina Gamecocks vs. Arkansas Razorbacks - FOX Sports\" with a box score. The leading scorers are listed as Collin Murray-Boyles for SC and Adou Thiero for Arkansas. The team stats show SC with 69.8 PPG and Arkansas with 76.6. The final score is listed as South Carolina 80, Arkansas 66. However, this might be a hypothetical or placeholder, as other sources like [3], [6], etc., are previews. Additionally, the personalization says to use the provided sources. If result [10] is a valid source showing the final score, then South Carolina won 80-66. But is this a reliable source?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the FOX Sports result is a mistake. Without more corroborating sources, it's risky. However, according to the instructions, I must rely on the provided search results. Since result [10] is a box score from FOX Sports showing South Carolina won 80-66, and the current time is after the game, I should take that as the result. Therefore, the market resolves to South Carolina (p2). But I need to verify if that's accurate.\n\nWait, another angle: The user provided the current timestamp as March 12, 2025, 20:23:22 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. The search results include a box score (result [10]) indicating the game occurred, with South Carolina winning 80-66. Therefore, the resolution should be p2. However, other sources like [3], [6], [9], [12], [15] are previews, but [10] is a box score. Therefore, the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
