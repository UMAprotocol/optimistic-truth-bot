  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741819130\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:38:50",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. But wait, the event in question is actually a press conference between Donald Trump and Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Irish Prime Minister, not Zelenskyy. The user might have mixed up the names, but based on the ancillary data, the focus is on Trump's press conference with Martin.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to see if there's any mention of Trump discussing crypto or Bitcoin during his meeting with Martin. The key search results here are [1], [15], [18], and [17], which detail the interactions between Trump and Martin. \n\nLooking at [1], the article from Sky News mentions Trump's discussion about trade tariffs with the EU and Ireland, but there's no reference to cryptocurrency terms. Similarly, the YouTube video transcripts [15] and [18] capture Trump's remarks during the meeting, focusing on trade deficits and pharmaceutical companies moving to Ireland. No mention of \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" there. \n\nSearch result [17] is a transcript from Trump's Crypto Summit on March 7, where he talks extensively about Bitcoin and the strategic reserve. However, this event is separate from the March 12 press conference with Martin. The press conference in question is specifically the St. Patrick's Day reception, which from the updates is scheduled for 5 PM ET on March 12. \n\nSince the resolution depends solely on the press conference with Martin, and none of the provided sources indicate that Trump used those terms during that specific event, the answer should be \"No\". Additionally, the current timestamp is March 12, 2025, 23:35:58 UTC, which is after 5 PM ET (22:35 UTC), so the event has already occurred. Without any evidence from the sources that Trump mentioned the keywords during that presser, the resolution is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
