  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741817703\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:15:03",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Ukraine\" five or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"Ukraine\" in that specific event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results to see if there's any mention of the press conference and whether Trump mentioned Ukraine during it. Looking at the sources, several articles ([1], [4], [7], [16]) describe the meeting between Trump and Miche\u00e1l Martin. The press conference was part of the St. Patrick's Day events. \n\nIn source [1], Trump is quoted discussing Ukraine, mentioning that it's now up to Russia to decide on a ceasefire. He also talks about the Department of Education's staffing cuts. However, the exact number of times \"Ukraine\" was said isn't specified. Source [4] mentions Trump and Martin discussing trade tensions and the EU's response, but again, no direct count. \n\nSource [8] is a YouTube video where Trump mentions Ukraine peace talks during the meeting with Martin. The transcript shows Trump discussing Ukraine, but again, the count isn't clear. Source [18] includes a letter from Zelenskyy read by Trump in Congress, but that's a different event.\n\nThe key point here is that the press conference in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. The user specified that only the press conference counts, not preceding meetings. The search results don't provide a verbatim transcript of the press conference, but they do indicate that Ukraine was a topic of discussion. However, without explicit evidence of Trump saying \"Ukraine\" five or more times during that exact event, we can't confirm the count met the threshold.\n\nMoreover, the current date is March 12, 2025, and the event happened on the same day. The sources report that Trump mentioned Ukraine, but no source explicitly states he said it five times. Without video evidence or a transcript confirming the exact count, the resolution can't be definitively \"Yes.\" Since the event has occurred but the required evidence isn't present in the provided sources, the recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve at this time). However, according to the user's resolution conditions, p4 is for future events. Since the event has already happened but the necessary data isn't available, the correct recommendation would be p3 (unknown/50-50) if the information is inconclusive. But the user's resolution conditions state p3 as 0.5. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and unresolved, but here, the event has occurred, but the required data isn't available. However, the user's instructions say to use p4 only for future events. Since the event has already occurred, but the resolution source (video) isn't accessible here, and the provided search results don't confirm the count, the answer should be p3 (0.5) as per the resolution conditions. But wait, looking back, the resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is future. Since the event has already occurred, but the information isn't sufficient, maybe p3 is appropriate. However, the user's instructions state that if the event is in the past and can't be verified, answer as per available info. The sources here mention Trump discussing Ukraine, but not the exact count. Since the user requires the term to be said 5+ times, and the sources don't confirm that, but the event has passed, maybe the answer is \"No\" (p1). However, the sources don't explicitly state the count. Given that the user's resolution source is the video, which isn't available here, and the provided context doesn't confirm the count, the safest recommendation is p3 (0.5). But the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to unknown. However, the user's personalization says to return p4 only for future events. Since the event has occurred, but the information is insufficient, perhaps the answer is p3. But I need to check the exact rules again.\n\nThe user's personalization states: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it.\" The provided search results include URLs, so I must use those. The search results mention Trump discussing Ukraine during the event but don't specify the count. Therefore, we can't confirm if it was five times, so the answer is p3 (0.5). However, the resolution_conditions in the query state p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50), which aligns with the uncertainty here. Therefore, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",
