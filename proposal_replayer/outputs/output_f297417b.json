  "user_prompt": "\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Price of dozen eggs hits $5 before April?, description: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the price for \"Eggs, Grade A, Large (Cost per Dozen) in U.S. City Average\" is $5.000 or greater when for any datapoint between January and March according to the St. Louis Fed (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000708111). Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe St. Louis Fed bases its numbers for egg prices on the BLS's CPI releases. The March release is presently scheduled for April 10, 2025. Resolution of this market will take place upon the update of the St. Louis Fed's chart.\n\nThe resolution source for this market measures prices to the third decimal place. Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741803617\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 19:20:17",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs in the U.S. will reach $5 or more between January and March 2025, according to the data from the St. Louis Fed, which sources its numbers from the BLS CPI releases. The resolution depends on whether any data point in those three months meets or exceeds $5.000.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available search results for the relevant data. Let's look through the sources provided. \n\nSource [1] from the St. Louis Fed shows the average price in February 2025 as $5.897. That's already above $5, which would immediately suggest the answer is \"Yes\". But wait, the user's query mentions resolution based on data points between January and March 2025. The March data would be released in April, but according to the current timestamp, it's March 12, 2025. The March CPI data hasn't been released yet, but the February data is already out and shows $5.897. \n\nLooking at other sources, [2] confirms the February price at $5.897, up from January's $4.953. Source [8] mentions January's average at $4.95, which is just below $5, but February's data from [1] and [2] clearly exceed $5. Since the query is about any datapoint in January to March, February's data alone would satisfy the condition. \n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the February data is part of the January-March period. Since February is within that range, and the price was $5.897, the answer should be \"Yes\". Even if March's data isn't out yet, the February data already meets the threshold. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. Source [3] mentions a USDA Secretary stating egg prices declined to $1.85, but that seems inconsistent with other sources. However, this might be a typo or misreporting, as all other sources, including the primary data from the St. Louis Fed, show prices well above $5 in February. The discrepancy in source [3] could be an error, so the primary data from the BLS via FRED is more reliable. \n\nAdditionally, sources [9] and [10] discuss ongoing factors like bird flu and inflation contributing to rising egg prices, supporting the sustained high prices into 2025. The USDA report in [13] indicates a decrease in egg production, which would further pressure prices upward. \n\nConsidering all this, the February data point at $5.897 is within the specified timeframe and exceeds $5. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
