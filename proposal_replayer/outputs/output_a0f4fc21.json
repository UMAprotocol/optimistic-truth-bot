  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741831309\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 03:01:49",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this query. The user is asking about a specific NBA game between the Charlotte Hornets and Atlanta Hawks scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the Hornets win, the Hawks win, if the game is postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date given is March 13, 2025, 02:59:14, which is the day after the scheduled game. So the game should have taken place on March 12. Now, I need to look at the search results to see if there's any information about the outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [1] from FOX Sports shows the game's box score with the title \"Charlotte Hornets vs. Atlanta Hawks - March 12, 2025\" and mentions LeVert scoring 21 points. The leading scorers listed are Miles Bridges for the Hornets and Trae Young for the Hawks. However, the detailed stats here might be from a previous game because the date mentioned in the snippet is 2024-03-12, which could be a typo or an error. But the URL and the context suggest it's about the 2025 game. \n\nResult [2] is a preview from Doc's Sports, dated 2025-03-12, which is the day of the game. It mentions that the Hawks will try to defeat the Hornets but doesn't provide the result. Result [3] from Dimers.com gives a prediction that the Hawks have a 74% chance of winning with a projected score of 112-119. However, this is a prediction, not the actual result. \n\nResult [7] from ATS.io, dated 2025-03-12, talks about the upcoming game, mentioning the Hawks' three consecutive wins and the Hornets' recent upset against the Heat. Still, it's a preview, not a post-game report. \n\nResult [9] from Dimers.com again predicts a Hawks win with a projected score of 123-115, but this is still a prediction. Result [11] from Scoresandstats.com discusses the game as a preview, mentioning the Hawks' recent win over the 76ers and the Hornets' victory against the Heat. It also notes their previous meeting on November 30, 2024, where the Hawks won 107-104. \n\nResult [15] from ESPN UK has a live score page updated on December 3, 2024, which seems to be a mistake since the game is in March 2025. The data here might not be relevant. \n\nOther results like [4] discuss a postponed game between the Hawks and Rockets in January 2025 due to weather, but that's a different game. Results [5], [13], and others are unrelated to the specific game outcome. \n\nCrucially, none of the search results provide a clear confirmation of the game's result. The only actual game data is in result [1], which might be a box score from the game. The FOX Sports page lists the Hornets vs. Hawks game on March 12, 2025, with stats for players like LeVert (21 points) and mentions the Hawks' standing. However, without explicit confirmation of the final score or winner, it's unclear. \n\nSince the current date is March 13, 2025, and the game was on March 12, the lack of explicit post-game reports in the search results is confusing. If the game happened, there should be reports, but the provided snippets don't confirm the outcome. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event hasn't occurred yet or can't be verified, the response should be p4. However, since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, it should have occurred. \n\nBut given the search results don't conclusively show the result, and some sources like [1] might have conflicting dates (2024 vs. 2025), it's possible that the game's result isn't available in the provided data. Therefore, without verified sources confirming the outcome, the resolution should be p4, indicating insufficient information to resolve.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
