  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741803958\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 19:25:58",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking about a market resolution based on the outcome of the Virginia vs. Georgia Tech basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The current time is March 12, 2025, 19:24:06 UTC, which converts to 3:24 PM ET. So the game has already started and likely concluded by now.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any information about the game's result in the provided search results. Let's go through the sources again. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are previews or past game analyses. However, result [16] from YouTube mentions that Georgia Tech defeated Virginia 66-60 in the ACC Tournament's second round. The timestamp on this is March 12, 2025, so it's from today. This seems to be a post-game report confirming Georgia Tech's win. \n\nAdditionally, the user's resolution conditions state that if Georgia Tech wins, the market resolves to p1. Since the game was today and the result is available, and the current time is after the scheduled game time, the event has occurred. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (Georgia Tech) based on the confirmed result from source [16].\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
