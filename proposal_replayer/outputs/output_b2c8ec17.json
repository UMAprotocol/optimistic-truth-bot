  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741818189\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:23:09",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Donald Trump said the word \"Hell\" three or more times during his press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Prime Minister of Ireland, on March 12, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" if not. Let me start by reviewing the provided search results to see if there's any mention of that specific event and what was said.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several mentions of Trump's interactions with Ireland. For example, search results [1], [2], and [13] mention Trump hosting the Irish Prime Minister for a St. Patrick's Day event on March 12, 2025. The articles discuss Trump's comments about tariffs and Ireland taking advantage of the US, but they don't specifically mention the press conference or the use of the word \"Hell\" in that context. \n\nI also notice that search result [10] quotes Miche\u00e1l Martin saying Trump was right that Gaza is \"hell on earth,\" but that's from February 8, 2025, and it's Martin's statement, not Trump's. The user query is specifically about Trump's press conference on March 12. \n\nOther search results mention Trump using the word \"Hell\" in different contexts. For example, in [3], during a rally, he says \"knock the hell out of people backstage\" and mentions \"Hell\" again when talking about border security. In [4], he warns that \"Hell will break out\" if hostages aren't released. However, these are from different events and dates. \n\nThe key here is the specific press conference on March 12, 2025. The search results [1], [2], and [13] all reference the St. Patrick's Day event with the Irish PM on March 12, but none of them report Trump using the word \"Hell\" during that event. The articles focus on tariffs, government funding, and layoffs, not his exact wording during the press conference. \n\nSince there's no evidence in the provided sources that Trump used \"Hell\" three times during that specific press conference, and the user's query requires confirmation based on the video of the event (which isn't available here), the resolution should be based on the lack of evidence in the given data. Therefore, the answer would be \"No,\" corresponding to p1. However, I need to check if any of the search results might have transcripts or mentions of the press conference. \n\nLooking again, search results [1], [2], and [13] are all similar, mentioning the event but not the press conference's content. The other results are unrelated to the March 12 event. Without explicit mentions of Trump saying \"Hell\" three times during that specific presser, I can't confirm it happened. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
