  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741819583\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:46:23",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to resolve this UMA optimistic oracle request based on the user's query. The user is asking about the outcome of the Fresno State vs. Nevada basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 4:30 PM ET. The current date and time given are March 12, 2025, 23:44:41 UTC, which is 10:45 PM UTC, so the game should have already happened. But wait, the game was scheduled for 4:30 PM ET. Let me check the time zones. ET is UTC-4 or UTC-5 depending on daylight saving. On March 12, it's probably UTC-4, so 4:30 PM ET would be 8:30 PM UTC. The current timestamp is 23:44:41 UTC, which is 11:44 PM UTC, so the game should have concluded by now. Therefore, if the game happened, I need to determine the result.\n\nLooking at the search results, the latest info is from March 12, 2025. The game in question is the Mountain West Conference Championship first-round game between Fresno State (6-25) and Nevada (16-15). The search results include a CBS Sports game recap from March 12, 2025, which isn't detailed in the provided snippets, but other sources like Dimers.com and ATS.io predict a Nevada win with high confidence (90% chance). However, predictions aren't actual results. \n\nWait, the user provided search results up to [11], which includes a game boxscore link from Fox Sports for March 12, 2025, but the content isn't fully detailed here. The other sources ([9], [10], [11]) are predictions made before the game. The actual result would need to be verified from the latest sources. However, in the provided search results, there's no explicit mention of the game's outcome post-March 12. The latest actual game data is from February 10, 2025, where Nevada defeated Fresno State 94-69. \n\nSince the current timestamp is March 12, 2025, and the game was scheduled for that day, but the user hasn't provided any search results confirming the outcome, I need to check if the game was played. The ancillary data mentions if the game is postponed or canceled. The search results don't indicate any cancellation or postponement. However, without explicit confirmation, I can't assume the result. But wait, the Fox Sports link [6] might have the actual result, but the snippet only shows odds and player news, not the result. The CBS Sports link [7] is from February 10. The Dimers prediction [10] is from March 12 but is a prediction, not the result. \n\nGiven that the user's provided search results don't include the actual outcome of the March 12 game, and the current time is after the scheduled game time, but there's no data here confirming the result, I might have to conclude that there's no verifiable result available in the provided sources. However, according to the oracle's rules, if the event has occurred but there's no data, I should check if it's verifiable. Since the search results don't include the result, and the user's ancillary data says if the game is canceled, it resolves to 50-50. But the game was scheduled, and there's no info on cancellation, so maybe it was played. But without evidence, can't confirm. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided search results. Since all provided search results about March 12 are predictions, not actual results, and the actual result isn't in the context, the correct resolution would be p4 if the event is in the future, but since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, but no result is available in the sources, perhaps it's unresolved. Wait, the current timestamp is March 12, 23:44:41 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (4:30 PM ET = 8:30 PM UTC). So the game should have happened, but the provided search results don't include the outcome. Therefore, according to the oracle rules, if the event has occurred but cannot be verified with the provided sources, it's treated as unknown, hence p3? Wait, no. The rules say if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, return p4. But here, the event's scheduled time has passed, so it's not future. However, the provided sources don't confirm the result. The oracle instructions say to use only the provided search results. Since the search results don't include the actual outcome (only predictions), and the game's time has passed, but there's no result in the sources, the resolution would be p3 (unknown/50-50) only if the game was canceled or not played. However, there's no info on cancellation. The user's instructions say if the event is in the past but no info, perhaps it's unresolved. But according to the ancillary data, if the game is canceled, it resolves to 50-50. Otherwise, if played, it should resolve based on the result. Since there's no info, but the game was scheduled and presumably played, but no result in the sources, the oracle can't verify, hence p4 isn't applicable because it's not future. Wait, the current time is after the event, so it's not future. The oracle needs to resolve based on verified facts. If the sources don't provide the result, then the answer can't be verified, so it's unresolved. But the instructions say if the event has occurred but cannot be verified, how to resolve? The ancillary data says if canceled, p3. Otherwise, if played but no result, perhaps it's unknown, but the instructions don't cover that. The user's personalization says to resolve based on verified facts. Since there's no verified result in the sources, perhaps the market can't be resolved and would go to p3. But the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which is for canceled or unknown. However, the game was scheduled, and there's no indication it was canceled, so maybe it's played but no data. In that case, since the oracle can't verify the result, perhaps it's p3. But wait, the user's instructions say if the event is in the future (relative to the timestamp), return p4. Since the event's time has passed, it's not future. Therefore, the oracle should try to find the result. If no result is available in the provided sources, perhaps the answer is p3. But I need to check the provided search results again. \n\nLooking again, the Fox Sports link [6] from March 12 has a boxscore, but the snippet doesn't show the result. The CBS Sports link [7] is from February 10. The Dimers prediction [10] and ATS.io [11] are predictions. The docsports.com [9] preview also doesn't have the result. Since none of the provided sources confirm the actual outcome, despite the game having occurred, the oracle can't verify the result and must resolve to p3. However, the user's resolution_conditions say p3 is for 50-50 if canceled. But if the game was played and the result isn't known, does that count as p3? The instructions aren't clear. Alternatively, maybe the market should resolve to p3 only if canceled. Since there's no info on cancellation, and the game was scheduled, perhaps the correct resolution is p3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the lack of information means it's unresolved, but according to the oracle rules, if the event has occurred but no data, it's treated as unknown. Given the strict instructions, if the result isn't in the provided sources, the oracle can't confirm and should resolve to p3. However, the user's personalization says to return p4 for future events. Since this event is in the past, p4 doesn't apply. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3. But wait, the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5 for unknown/50-50. So, in the absence of verifiable information, it's p3. Therefore, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",
