  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741818957\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:35:57",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to resolve this market about whether Donald Trump will say the term \"Trans\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. Let me start by looking at the provided search results to find any evidence of Trump using that term during the event.\n\nFirst, I'll check the details of the event. The press conference was part of the St. Patrick's Day activities. The search results mention several interactions between Trump and Miche\u00e1l Martin. From source [1], the meeting included discussions on Ukraine, Gaza, and trade tariffs. There's a mention of Trump criticizing the EU and discussing education staffing cuts, but nothing about transgender issues here.\n\nLooking at source [4], the focus was on trade tensions and the annual tradition. Source [6] has Trump discussing the EU and Ireland's role, again no mention of transgender topics. Source [7] describes the meeting as traditionally friendly, with brief mentions of Ukraine and trade, but no indication of Trump bringing up transgender issues.\n\nSources like [3], [5], [9], and [14] discuss Trump's policies and executive orders targeting transgender people, but these are from earlier dates (March 5th, January 23rd, February 1st, January 29th). The press conference in question was on March 12th, and none of the reports from that day's event mention Trump using the term \"Trans\". \n\nAdditionally, source [8] mentions potential topics like trade imbalance and Israel, but again, no reference to transgender discussions. Source [11] covers Trump's comments on Ireland's tax system and the EU trade war, still no mention of \"Trans\". \n\nSince all the search results related to the March 12th event don't include any mention of Trump discussing transgender issues or using the term \"Trans\", and the resolution conditions require the term to be spoken during the specific press conference, the answer should be \"No\". The ancillary data specifies that only the press conference with Martin counts, and preceding meetings don't qualify. Even though Trump has a history of anti-trans policies, there's no evidence he used the term during this particular event.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
