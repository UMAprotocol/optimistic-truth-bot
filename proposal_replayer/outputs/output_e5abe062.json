  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741816253\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 22:50:53",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Saint Patrick\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he used that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results to see if there's any mention of Trump using the term \"Saint Patrick\" during the event. The search results include various articles and videos about the meeting. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at result [1], it's about the Taoiseach's visit, but doesn't mention Trump saying \"Saint Patrick.\" Result [2] discusses potential scaling back of St. Patrick's Day events, but again, no direct quote. Result [3] is a YouTube video titled \"President Trump meets with Irish Prime minister before St...\", but the transcript snippet doesn't include the term. Result [4] mentions the shamrock ceremony but not the specific phrase. \n\nResult [5] has a live blog of the event. At 12:35pm, they mention the shamrock ceremony but no direct quotes. Result [8] describes the meeting and trade tensions, but Trump's quoted remarks don't include \"Saint Patrick.\" Result [10] quotes Trump saying the friendship is \"strong and unbreakable\" but again, no mention of the exact term. \n\nResult [13] is a video titled \"FULL: President Trump meets with Irish PM marking St. Patrick's Day.\" The description mentions he answered questions about various topics. The transcript snippet includes Trump saying \"St. Patrick's Day\" but the user's query specifies \"Saint Patrick\" \u2013 the full name versus the abbreviated form. The market rules state that the exact term \"Saint Patrick\" is needed, so \"St. Patrick\" might not count unless the rules consider abbreviations. Wait, the query says pluralization/possessive forms count, but other forms do not. \"St.\" is an abbreviation, so unless the rules consider \"St.\" as equivalent to \"Saint,\" which they might not, then \"St. Patrick's Day\" wouldn't qualify. However, the user's example allows \"St. Patrick's Day\" since they mention it in the query description. Wait, the query's title says \"Saint Patrick,\" but the description mentions \"St. Patrick's Day.\" The market resolution conditions specify that the term is \"Saint Patrick,\" so using \"St.\" would be an abbreviation. The rules state that other forms (like abbreviations) would not count unless specified. Wait, the user's query says: \"Any usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market. Pluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\" So \"St. Patrick\" is an abbreviation of \"Saint Patrick,\" which is a different form. Therefore, if Trump said \"St. Patrick,\" that's an abbreviation and doesn't count. But in the search result [15], the Irish Echo article mentions the Taoiseach extending \"St. Patrick's Day greetings,\" but that's from the Taoiseach, not Trump. \n\nLooking at result [13], the video transcript snippet includes Trump saying \"St. Patrick's Day\" during the meeting. But according to the resolution conditions, only the term \"Saint Patrick\" counts. Since \"St.\" is an abbreviation, it's a different form, so it wouldn't count. Therefore, unless Trump said the full \"Saint Patrick,\" the answer is no. \n\nNow, checking other sources: result [18] has a transcript where Trump says, \"to celebrate St Patrick's uh with you.\" Again, using \"St.\" instead of \"Saint.\" No other results mention Trump using the full term \"Saint Patrick.\" Therefore, based on the provided search results, it seems Trump did not say the exact term \"Saint Patrick\" during the press conference but used the abbreviated form. Hence, the resolution should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
