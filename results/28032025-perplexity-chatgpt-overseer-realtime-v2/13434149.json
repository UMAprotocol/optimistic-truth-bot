        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Cleveland Guardians vs. Kansas City Royals game on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Royals, p2 is Guardians, and p3 is 50-50 if the game is postponed, canceled, or suspended without completion by March 31. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game date as March 29, 2025, at 4:10 PM EDT at Kauffman Stadium. Sources [1], [2], [4], [7], [8], [9], and [10] all reference the game happening on that date. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so the game did start.\n\nNext, was the game completed? Sources [1] and [4] mention the first game of the series went into extra innings, but the current query is about the March 29 game. Wait, looking at source [9], the box score shows the Guardians vs. Royals game on March 29 with a final score. The box score lists the Guardians with 7 runs and the Royals with 4 runs. Additionally, source [10] (ESPN) lists the game result as Guardians 7, Royals 4. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm if this is the correct game. The ancillary data's description refers to the March 29 game. The box score in [9] and the ESPN link [10] both show the final score as Guardians 7, Royals 4. Therefore, the game was completed, and the official outcome is a Guardians win. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, since the Guardians won, the market should resolve to p2. All sources confirming the game's completion and the result align with MLB's official records. No indications of suspension or tie, so p3 isn't applicable. The answer is clear: recommend p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians defeated the Kansas City Royals 7-4 in the March 29, 2025 MLB game at Kauffman Stadium[9][10]. This outcome was officially recorded by Major League Baseball, with the Guardians securing their second win of the season and the Royals remaining winless[1][9]. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, and was completed within the March 29 timeframe with no suspensions or incomplete statuses requiring resolution by March 31[1][9][10].\n\nKey game details:\n- Final score: Guardians 7, Royals 4[9][10]\n- Official MLB boxscore confirms the result[9]\n- Game occurred on scheduled date without delays[1][7]\n- No evidence of incomplete play or tie conditions[9][10]\n\nrecommendation: p2",
