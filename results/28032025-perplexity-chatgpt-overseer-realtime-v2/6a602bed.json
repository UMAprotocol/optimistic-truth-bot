The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the NBA game between the Charlotte Hornets and Toronto Raptors scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hornets win, it's p2; Raptors win, p1; postponed remains open, and canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 29, 2025, 1:47:58 AM UTC. The game was supposed to happen on March 28, which is now in the past. So the event date has already passed. \n\nNext, I need to determine the outcome of the game. Looking through the search results, let's see which sources mention the actual result. \n\nSearch result [5] from ESPN PH provides a live score page. The final score listed there is Raptors 133, Hornets 138. Wait, that shows the Hornets won 138-133. But the date on that page is March 28, and the live coverage would have the final score. \n\nAnother source, [6] from CBS Sports, mentions that the Hornets won the lone matchup earlier this season, but that might refer to a previous game. Wait, the query is about the March 28 game. Let me check again. \n\nLooking at [5] again, the live score page shows the Hornets vs. Raptors game on March 28 with the final score Hornets 138, Raptors 133. That's a clear indication that the Hornets won. \n\nAdditionally, search result [7] from Dimers.com had a prediction model giving the Raptors a 70% chance to win, but the actual result might differ. However, the live score in [5] is definitive. \n\nAlso, checking the other sources: [1] is a preview before the game, [2] and [6] are predictions, [3] is about a trade, [4] is about a postponed game from January, [8] is about trade deadlines. So the only source with the actual result is [5]. \n\nTherefore, the Hornets won the game on March 28, 2025. According to the resolution conditions, a Hornets win corresponds to p2. \n\nI need to make sure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Search result [4] talks about a postponed game in January, but that's unrelated. The March 28 game happened as scheduled, as per [5]. \n\nSo the final answer should recommend p2, Hornets.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Charlotte Hornets and Toronto Raptors scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET concluded with the **Hornets defeating the Raptors 138-133**[5]. According to the ancillary data, a Hornets victory corresponds to resolution **p2**. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by the final score and lack of postponement notices in the search results[5][6]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
