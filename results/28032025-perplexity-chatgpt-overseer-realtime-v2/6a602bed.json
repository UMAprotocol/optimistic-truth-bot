The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Raptors, p2 is Hornets, and p3 is 50-50 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game date as March 28, 2025, and multiple sources like ESPN and YouTube highlight the game's final score. For example, result [1] from ESPN shows the Raptors won 108-97. Similarly, [3] and [11] confirm the Raptors' victory with Jakob Poeltl leading the team. \n\nNext, I should verify if there were any postponements or cancellations. Result [12] talks about rescheduled games due to wildfires, but those were in January and February 2025, not affecting the March 28 game. The game in question wasn't postponed, as all sources reference it happening on the scheduled date.\n\nLooking at the outcome, every source that reports the score states the Raptors won. The final scores from [1], [3], and [11] all align, showing Toronto's 108-97 win. There's no mention of the game being canceled or unresolved. \n\nSince the game occurred as planned and the Raptors won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information or uncertainties are present in the sources provided. All evidence points to a clear Raptors victory.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Charlotte Hornets and Toronto Raptors on March 28, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET concluded with the **Toronto Raptors winning 108-97**[1][3][11]. Key details from verified sources confirm:\n\n- **Final Score**: Raptors 108, Hornets 97[1][11]\n- **Game Context**: This marked Toronto's third consecutive win, with Jakob Poeltl leading the team (24 points, 12 rebounds) and Immanuel Quickley adding 19 points[11]. Charlotte\u2019s Mark Williams scored 18 points in the loss[3].\n- **Postponement/Cancellation Check**: The game was played as scheduled, with no indications of delays or cancellations in the provided sources. Earlier postponed Hornets games (e.g., February 19 vs. Lakers) were unrelated[12].\n\nGiven the verified outcome and adherence to the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **Raptors**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
