The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the game between the Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hawks win, it's p2; if the Bucks win, p1; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 30) is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [4] from Sportskeeda mentions the Hawks dominated the Bucks 145-124. Similarly, sources [9], [10], [11], and [12] all report the same final score with the Hawks winning. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of postponement or cancellation. Source [3] talks about a postponed game in January 2025 between the Hawks and Rockets, but that's unrelated. The other sources, especially the ESPN game summary [6] and CBS Sports [11], clearly state the game happened on March 30. \n\nThe resolution conditions are straightforward: Hawks win is p2. All the evidence points to the Hawks winning decisively. There's no indication the game was postponed or canceled. Therefore, the correct resolution should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 145-124 in their March 30, 2025 matchup[4][9][10][11][12]. Multiple sources confirm the Hawks dominated after trailing early, outscoring the Bucks 81-48 across the second and third quarters[4][9]. Key performers included Zaccharie Risacher (36 points)[9][10][11] and Dyson Daniels (22 points, franchise-record 213 steals)[9][11], while Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee with 31 points[9][10].\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation mentioned in the results[4][6][9][12]. Since the Hawks won decisively per all available evidence, the market resolves to the outcome specified for their victory. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
