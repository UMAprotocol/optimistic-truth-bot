The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Miami Open semifinal match between Jakub Men\u0161\u00edk and Taylor Fritz. The ancillary data specifies that p2 corresponds to Men\u0161\u00edk winning, p1 to Fritz, and p3 if it's a tie, canceled, or delayed beyond April 28, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the actual outcome of the match. Looking through the sources, several articles mention the result. Source [1] states that Mensik beat Djokovic in the final, which implies he must have won the semifinal against Fritz. Source [6] explicitly says Mensik defeated Fritz in the semifinals with a score of 7-6, 4-6, 7-6. Similarly, source [8] confirms that Mensik won against Fritz in three sets to reach the final. Other sources like [10] and [12] also back this up, detailing the match's tiebreaks and Mensik's victory.\n\nThe match date was March 28, 2025, and all sources indicate the match occurred as scheduled without delays beyond April 28. Since the result is clear and multiple credible sources confirm Mensik's win, the resolution should be p2. There's no mention of the match being canceled or delayed, so p3 isn't applicable here. All conditions for p2 are met.\n</think>\n\nJakub Men\u0161\u00edk defeated Taylor Fritz in the Miami Open men's singles semifinal on March 28, 2025, with a score of 7-6(4), 4-6, 7-6(4)[6][8][12]. The match concluded without cancellation or delay, and Men\u0161\u00edk advanced to the final against Novak Djokovic[1][6]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410485 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:41:25 UTC",
