The ancillary data specifies that if the Knicks win, it's p2; if the Bucks win, p1; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game date as March 28, 2025, and multiple sources like ESPN and YouTube highlight videos confirm the game took place. So no postponement or cancellation here.\n\nNext, determining the winner. Several sources ([9], [11], [13], [14]) explicitly state the Knicks won 116-107. For example, source [9] says the Knicks completed a season sweep with that score, and [11] from ESPN also reports the same final score with OG Anunoby leading the Knicks. The YouTube highlights in [9] and [11] back this up. \n\nI should also check for any discrepancies. All sources mentioning the outcome agree on the Knicks' victory. The Bucks' record after the game is noted as 40-32 in some sources, which aligns with a loss. No conflicting information found. \n\nSince the game occurred and the Knicks won, the resolution should be p2. No need to consider p1 or p3. The answer is straightforward based on the provided sources.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Knicks defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 116-107 in their March 28, 2025, matchup at Fiserv Forum[9][11][13]. This victory completed the Knicks' first regular-season sweep of the Bucks in over a decade[9]. Key performances included OG Anunoby's 31-point game (with 20 points in the fourth quarter) and Giannis Antetokounmpo's 30-point return from injury for the Bucks[9][11]. \n\n**Key factors in the outcome:**\n- The Knicks capitalized on turnovers, scoring 26 points off 16 Bucks turnovers compared to Milwaukee's 13 points off 9 Knicks turnovers[11]\n- New York attempted 18 more field goals than Milwaukee despite similar shooting percentages (48% vs. 54%)[11]\n- Josh Hart neared a triple-double with 13 points, 14 rebounds, and 8 assists[9]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[9][11][13]. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market resolves to:\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411005 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:50:05 UTC"
