The ancillary data specifies that if the Devils win, it's p2 (Devils), if the Wild win, p1 (Wild), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game in question has already occurred. The search results all mention the game on March 29, 2025. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles report the Devils won 5-2. For example, source [1] states, \"Nico Hischier scored three goals... New Jersey Devils beat the Minnesota Wild 5-2 on Saturday.\" Similarly, [3], [6], and [8] all confirm the Devils' victory. The final score is consistent across these reports. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed recaps and stats, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: Devils win resolves to p2. Since all credible sources confirm the Devils won 5-2, the correct resolution is p2. No conflicting information found.\n</think>\n\nThe New Jersey Devils defeated the Minnesota Wild 5-2 in their NHL game on March 29, 2025, at Xcel Energy Center. Nico Hischier led the Devils with a hat trick, scoring goals at 0:29 of the first period, 3:13 of the third period, and adding a power-play goal at 14:50 of the third[1][3][6]. Jacob Markstrom made 22 saves for New Jersey, while Minnesota's Ryan Hartman and Marcus Foligno scored their two goals[1][6]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, as evidenced by detailed recaps and box scores from multiple sources[1][2][3][6][8].  \n\n**recommendation: p2**",

It uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, where the New Jersey Devils won against the Minnesota Wild with a score of 5-2. This outcome aligns with the resolution condition p2 for a Devils win.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date of the event, followed by confirming the outcome through multiple sources, and checking for any possible postponements or cancellations. The detailed reporting of the game's score and key events (like Nico Hischier's hat trick) adds to the completeness and reliability of the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and provides a detailed account of the game, which matches the user prompt's description. The recommendation of p2 is directly aligned with the ancillary data where p2 corresponds to a Devils win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and does not include unnecessary or unrelated information.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the resolution conditions, and alignment with the user prompt, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome based on reliable sources, adheres to the resolution conditions, and aligns perfectly with the user prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, factually accurate, and complete.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412072 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:07:52 UTC",
