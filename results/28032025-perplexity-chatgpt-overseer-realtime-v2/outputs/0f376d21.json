The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MLB game between the Colorado Rockies and Tampa Bay Rays on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is for the Rays winning, p2 for the Rockies, and p3 if it's a tie, postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 28. The search results mention that the original Opening Day was postponed to March 28 [4][6]. Then, looking at the game recap in [1], it clearly states that the Rays won 3-2 with a walk-off home run by Kameron Misner in the ninth inning. The box score in [3] and other sources like [10] and [12] confirm the final score. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or suspended. The sources don't mention any postponement; instead, they detail the game's progression and conclusion on March 28. The game was completed as it went through all nine innings, so there's no suspension or early termination. MLB rules would consider this an official game. \n\nSince the Rays won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All the evidence points to a clear Rays victory without any issues affecting the game's completion.\n</think>\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Colorado Rockies 3-2 on March 28, 2025, in a game that concluded with a walk-off home run by rookie Kameron Misner in the ninth inning[1][3][13]. The game was played at George M. Steinbrenner Field as scheduled, with no postponements or suspensions reported[4][6]. \n\nKey details confirming the outcome:\n- The Rays tied the game in the seventh inning before Misner's ninth-inning homer secured the win[1][3].\n- MLB box scores and recaps from multiple sources (CBS Sports, Baseball Almanac, ESPN) all list the Rays as the official winner[1][3][10][12].\n- The game was declared official and completed within regulation play, meeting MLB's criteria for a resolved outcome[1][3].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743408852 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:14:12 UTC",
