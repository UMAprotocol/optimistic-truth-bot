The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Rays, p2 is Rockies, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 29, 2025, so the game date (March 28) is in the past. According to the rules, if the event date is in the past and there's verifiable information, we use that. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources confirm the game took place. Source [6] from RoxPile mentions the Rockies' Opening Day loss to the Rays with a walk-off home run in the ninth inning. Source [9] from ESPN details that rookie Kameron Misner hit a walk-off homer, leading the Rays to a 3-2 victory. Source [8] (ESPN's game summary) also lists the final score as Rays 3, Rockies 2. Additionally, source [7] mentions the Rays' 3-2 win, and source [9] reiterates the outcome.\n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as it's clear from multiple sources that it was played. The official MLB outcome, as per ESPN and other sports news outlets, has the Rays winning. There's no indication the game was suspended or ended in a tie. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1, corresponding to the Rays' victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Colorado Rockies 3-2 in their March 28, 2025 season opener at George M. Steinbrenner Field[6][8][9]. The game was decided by a walk-off home run from Rays rookie Kameron Misner in the bottom of the ninth inning, marking his first major league home run[9]. \n\nKey details:\n- **Official outcome**: Rays won 3-2[8][9]\n- **Game status**: Completed as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations[6][8]\n- **MLB rules**: The game was declared official with Tampa Bay as the winner under standard baseball regulations[9]\n\nThe market resolves to **p1** (Tampa Bay Rays victory) based on the verified game result.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
