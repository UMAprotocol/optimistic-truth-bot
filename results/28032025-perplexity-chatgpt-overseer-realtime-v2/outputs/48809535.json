        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chicago Cubs vs. Arizona Diamondbacks game on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p2 corresponds to the Cubs winning, p1 to the Diamondbacks, and p3 to a 50-50 split if the game is postponed, canceled, or ends in a tie. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 29 and determine the official result. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the game on March 29. Result [1] from Plain Text Sports shows the final score as Cubs 4, Diamondbacks 3. The play-by-play indicates the game went to the bottom of the 9th inning, with the Diamondbacks scoring 2 runs but ultimately falling short. \n\nResult [2] from Burn City Sports confirms the Diamondbacks lost 4-3, detailing the ninth-inning rally that came up short. Additionally, result [8] from ESPN's recap also lists the final score as 4-3 in favor of the Cubs. There's a mention of the game being completed with the Cubs winning, as per the official MLB outcome. \n\nI should also check if there were any suspensions or postponements. Result [5] talks about a suspended game from 2016, which isn't relevant here. The other results, especially [11] and [14], describe the game's conclusion with Dansby Swanson's defensive play securing the final out, confirming the game was completed on March 29 without suspension. \n\nSince the game was played to completion and the Cubs won 4-3, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. No indications of the game being postponed, canceled, or ending in a tie. All sources point to a Cubs victory, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Chicago Cubs defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 on March 29, 2025, in a game that concluded with a dramatic defensive play in the bottom of the ninth inning[1][2][8][11][14]. The Cubs held a 4-1 lead entering the ninth, but Arizona's Eugenio Su\u00e1rez hit a two-run homer to narrow the gap to 4-3[2][8]. With two outs and a runner on base, Diamondbacks pinch-runner Garrett Hampson overran third base on Corbin Carroll's infield grounder, allowing Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson to tag him out and end the game[11][14].\n\nKey details:\n- **Official outcome**: The game was completed on March 29 with no suspensions or cancellations[1][8]\n- **Scoring**: Kyle Tucker (3 RBI) and Matt Shaw (first career HR) provided Chicago's offense[2][16]\n- **Pitching**: Shota Imanaga earned the win with 7 IP, 3 H, 1 ER[2][8]\n- **MLB rules**: The game went 9 full innings and was declared official[1][8]\n\nThis resolution meets all ancillary data conditions for a completed game. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409350 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:22:30 UTC",
