The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the San Francisco Giants and Cincinnati Reds on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to p1 (Reds), p2 (Giants), or p3 (50-50) based on the game's outcome. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 30, 2025, and determine the official result. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, so the game should have already taken place. Let's look through the search results for evidence of the game's outcome.\n\nSearch result [6] from ESPN provides a recap of the game on March 30, 2025, stating the Giants won 6-3. Additionally, [9] mentions Matt Chapman's home run contributing to the Giants' 6-3 victory. Another source, [10], confirms the Giants' 6-3 win over the Reds, highlighting Robbie Ray's pitching and Chapman's performance. There's also [11] which discusses the Giants' series win against the Reds, further corroborating the outcome. \n\nI need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or suspended. The search results don't mention any postponement; instead, they detail the game's play-by-play and final score. Since the game was completed and the Giants won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Giants). All sources align on the result, so there's no ambiguity. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nThe San Francisco Giants defeated the Cincinnati Reds 6-3 on March 30, 2025, in a game that concluded without postponement or suspension[6][9][10]. The Giants' victory was secured with contributions including Matt Chapman's two-run homer and Robbie Ray's strong pitching performance[9][10]. The game was declared official under MLB rules, as evidenced by detailed recaps and box scores from multiple sources[6][10][11]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt, which emphasizes the need for factual verification and alignment with the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the date of the event and confirms that it has already occurred by the current timestamp. It uses multiple reliable sources (ESPN and other detailed recaps) to verify the outcome of the game, which is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of the event resolution. The response adheres to the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution strictly on verified facts and established outcomes.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event date and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It checks for any possible conditions that could alter the resolution (postponement, suspension) and finds none, leading to a straightforward resolution based on the Giants' victory.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the game was not postponed or suspended and was completed as scheduled. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 (Giants) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response thoroughly checks for any factors that could affect the resolution and finds none, leading to a confident recommendation based on the established facts.\n\nGiven the thorough verification, accurate adherence to the resolution conditions, and logical processing of the information, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. There is no need for a rerun or default to p4, as the response meets all the required criteria for accuracy and reliability.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on verified facts and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the event and checked for any conditions that could affect the resolution.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409233 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:20:33 UTC",
