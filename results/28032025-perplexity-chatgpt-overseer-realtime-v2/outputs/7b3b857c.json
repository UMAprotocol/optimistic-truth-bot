The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Rodriguez vs. Costa fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the event has already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome. The main sources to look at are the ones that report the fight results. \n\nLooking at source [1], it's from MMA Decisions and clearly states \"Melquizael Costa def. Christian Rodriguez\" with a unanimous decision. The judges' scores are all 29-28 in favor of Costa. That's a strong indicator. \n\nSource [4] from Cageside Press also confirms the official result: Melquizael Costa won by unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28). This matches the information from source [1]. \n\nSource [2] is a YouTube video titled \"Melquizael Costa Battles to Decision Win Over Christian Rodriguez,\" which aligns with the other reports. The description mentions the judges scored it 29-28 for Costa. \n\nSource [9] had a prediction favoring Costa, but the actual result is what matters here. The other sources like [12] and [13] discuss betting odds and predictions before the fight, but the post-fight results in [1], [2], and [4] are definitive. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Costa wins, it resolves to p1. Since all credible sources confirm Costa's victory via unanimous decision, the resolution should be p1. There's no mention of a draw or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All post-event reports agree on Costa's win. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nMelquizael Costa defeated Christian Rodriguez by unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28) in their featherweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. All three judges scored the fight in favor of Costa, with media scores largely supporting this outcome despite some dissenting opinions[1][4]. The official result was confirmed by multiple sources including MMA Decisions and Cageside Press, aligning with the resolution conditions where Costa's victory corresponds to p1[1][4][2].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the event's outcome through credible sources and aligning the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event took place on March 29, 2025, and the current date is March 31, 2025, confirming that the event has occurred. It uses multiple credible sources (MMA Decisions, Cageside Press, and a YouTube video) to verify that Melquizael Costa won the bout by unanimous decision. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data where Costa's victory corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by checking multiple sources to confirm the fight's outcome. It ensures there is no conflicting information and that all sources agree on Costa's victory. The response also correctly disregards irrelevant information such as predictions and betting odds that do not affect the actual result.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome accurately and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the facts as per the ancillary data conditions. Costa's win leads to a resolution of p1, which is correctly recommended.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on verified outcomes and does not speculate or infer beyond the provided evidence.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410827 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:47:07 UTC",
