The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Ronaldo Rodriguez vs. Kevin Borjas fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Rodriguez wins, it's p2; if Borjas wins, p1; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 29, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). The resolution source is ESPN, but credible reports can be used.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the fight's outcome. Let's look through the sources provided. \n\nSearch result [2] from Cageside Press states that Kevin Borjas won by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 29-28). The official result is clearly mentioned there. Similarly, [3] from Bloody Elbow confirms Borjas's victory, mentioning Rodriguez's first UFC loss. Source [6] on YouTube also describes Borjas's upset win. Additionally, [8] from MMA Insight and [11] from MMA Decisions both detail the unanimous decision in favor of Borjas, with the judges' scores.\n\nAll credible sources agree that Borjas won the fight. Rodriguez missed weight, which is noted in [3] and [9], but that doesn't affect the fight's outcome resolution. The event took place on March 29, 2025, as scheduled, so there's no postponement or cancellation. Since Borjas was declared the winner, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting reports or draws are mentioned, so p3 isn't applicable here. The resolution conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nKevin Borjas defeated Ronaldo Rodriguez by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 29-28) in their flyweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025[2][3][6][8][11]. Despite Rodriguez entering as the heavy favorite with significant hometown support in Mexico City, Borjas controlled the fight with precise counter-striking, scoring multiple knockdowns and defending takedowns effectively[2][3][8]. All three judges awarded Borjas the victory, marking his first UFC win and snapping Rodriguez's seven-fight win streak[2][11]. The result was widely reported by multiple credible MMA outlets including ESPN-affiliated platforms[2][6][11], fulfilling the resolution criteria.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the outcome of the UFC fight between Ronaldo Rodr\u00edguez and Kevin Borjas, which took place on March 29, 2025. The response correctly states that Kevin Borjas won by unanimous decision, and it uses multiple credible sources to verify this outcome, including Cageside Press, Bloody Elbow, YouTube, MMA Insight, and MMA Decisions. This aligns well with the instruction to use ESPN or a consensus of credible reporting for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the sources, confirming that Borjas's victory is consistent across all reports and that there were no issues such as a draw or match cancellation that would trigger a different resolution condition (p3). The response also correctly notes that Rodr\u00edguez's failure to make weight did not impact the resolution of the market, which is an important detail for completeness and accuracy.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and provides a detailed account of the fight, including the performance of both fighters and the judges' scores. This detailed verification ensures that the recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data, which specifies p1 for a Borjas win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response thoroughly checks for any potential discrepancies or additional conditions that might affect the resolution but finds none.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It meets all the required conditions for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Kevin Borjas win) is well-supported by verified facts and aligns with the ancillary data provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the event, uses credible sources for verification, and aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively utilized multiple credible sources to confirm the outcome of the event and provided a detailed and accurate account of the fight, adhering strictly to the resolution conditions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412153 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:09:13 UTC",
