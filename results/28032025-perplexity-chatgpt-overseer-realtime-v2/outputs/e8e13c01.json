The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Rangers, p2 is Red Sox, and p3 is 50-50 if the game is postponed, canceled, or suspended without completion. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 30) is in the past. Now, I need to confirm the game's outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the March 30 game. Result [2] from pressherald.com states that the Rangers won 3-2 with home runs by Wyatt Langford and Adolis Garc\u00eda in the sixth inning. Result [8] is a video highlight of Garc\u00eda's go-ahead homer in the 6th, and result [11] is a condensed game confirming the Rangers' victory. Additionally, result [13] from YouTube also confirms the Rangers' win with a final score of 3-2. \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or suspended, as all sources indicate it was completed. The official outcome from MLB would list the Rangers as the winners. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Rangers). No conflicting information is present in the sources, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Red Sox vs. Texas Rangers game on March 30, 2025, concluded with the **Texas Rangers winning 3-2** [2][8][11][13]. Adolis Garc\u00eda and Wyatt Langford hit solo home runs in the sixth inning to secure the victory, overcoming a brief 2-1 deficit created by Boston\u2019s two-run top of the sixth. The game was completed without postponement or suspension, and the official MLB outcome confirms the Rangers as the winner[2][11].  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **p1** (Rangers) based on the official game result.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411501 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:58:21 UTC",
