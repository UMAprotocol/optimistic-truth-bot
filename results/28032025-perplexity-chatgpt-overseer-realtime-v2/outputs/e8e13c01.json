The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Rangers, p2 is Red Sox, and p3 is 50-50 if the game is postponed, canceled, or unresolved by April 1. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date given is March 30, 2025, 8:53 PM UTC. The game was supposed to start at 2:35 PM ET, which is 6:35 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the scheduled start, the game should have already begun. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources mentioning the game on March 30. Result [18] from FOX Sports shows the box score for the game, indicating it took place. Additionally, results [14], [15], and [16] from March 30 report that the Rangers won 4-3 against the Red Sox. Specifically, result [14] states that Adolis Garc\u00eda's performance led the Rangers to a 4-3 victory. \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as multiple sources confirm it was played. The final score was 4-3 in favor of the Rangers. According to the resolution conditions, since the Rangers (p1) won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being suspended or ending in a tie, so p3 isn't applicable here. All sources align on the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe MLB game between the Boston Red Sox and Texas Rangers on March 30, 2025, concluded with the **Texas Rangers winning 4-3**[14][15][16]. The game was played as scheduled at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, and was not postponed, canceled, or suspended. Adolis Garc\u00eda\u2019s go-ahead home run in the fourth inning and key contributions from Marcus Semien and Leody Taveras secured the Rangers' victory[14][16]. Since the Rangers (p1) won the game according to the official MLB outcome, the market resolves to **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743367940 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-30 20:52:20 UTC",
