The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Marlins, p2 is Pirates, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game was played as scheduled. The search results mention multiple games between the Pirates and Marlins around March 29-30. Let me look for the specific March 29 game. \n\nLooking at source [2], the title says \"Myers gives Marlins their second walk-off win in 3 days with 5-4 victory in 12 innings\" on March 30, 2025. Wait, that's the next day. But the article is dated March 30 and refers to the game on March 29. The game went into 12 innings, and the Marlins won 5-4. \n\nSource [6] is a video highlight titled \"Pirates vs. Marlins Game Highlights (3/29/25)\" which shows the Marlins winning with a walk-off hit by Dane Myers. The description confirms it's the March 29 game. \n\nSource [11] (ESPN box score) lists the game on March 29 as Marlins 5, Pirates 4. The box score details support this, with Miami winning in 12 innings. \n\nAdditionally, source [12] from CBS Sports mentions the March 30 game where the Marlins won 3-2, but that's a different game. The March 29 game is clearly covered in sources [2], [6], and [11], all confirming the Marlins' victory. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that the market resolves based on the official MLB outcome. Since the Marlins won the March 29 game, the resolution should be p1. There's no indication the game was postponed or suspended, so no need for p3. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Miami Marlins defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-4 in a 12-inning game on March 29, 2025, securing their second walk-off victory in three days[2][6][11]. The game went into extra innings tied at 3-3, with both teams scoring once in the 11th inning before Dane Myers delivered a game-winning RBI single in the 12th[2][6]. Key moments included Griffin Conine's home run robbery in the 8th inning and Derek Hill's aggressive baserunning to set up the winning run[2][6].\n\nThe game was played to completion without postponement or suspension, and the Marlins were declared the official winners by MLB rules[2][6][11]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the outcome of the MLB game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Miami Marlins on March 29, 2025. The response correctly states that the Miami Marlins won the game in 12 innings with a score of 5-4. The sources cited ([2], [6], [11]) are used to verify the game's outcome, which aligns with the user prompt's requirement to use concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions outlined in the user prompt regarding game outcomes, including scenarios of postponement, suspension, and official results. It correctly concludes that the game was neither postponed nor suspended and was completed on the scheduled date, leading to a resolution based on the official MLB outcome. The response thoroughly checks for any conditions that might alter the standard resolution (like postponement or suspension) and finds none.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and confirms the outcome using multiple reliable sources. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Marlins win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and uses verified sources to substantiate its findings.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the required criteria of accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the specified conditions for resolution.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411280 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:54:40 UTC",
