The ancillary data specifies that if the Magic win, it's p1; if the Kings win, p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date is March 29, 2025, 11:18 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 5:00 PM ET, which is 9:00 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, the event should have concluded. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game on March 29. Result [12] from CBS Sports provides a live score and stats, indicating the game took place. It mentions the Kings snapped a four-game losing streak with a 128-107 win over Portland, but that's their previous game. Wait, no\u2014looking closer, result [12] actually discusses the March 29 game. It says the Kings won 128-107 against Portland, but that's their prior game. The Magic lost to Dallas 101-92 on March 27. The Kings then faced the Magic on March 29. \n\nResult [13] from Action Network's live scores for March 29 lists the Kings at 35-37 and Magic at 35-38, but the final score isn't directly provided. However, result [12] from CBS Sports states that the Kings won their game against Portland on March 26 and then faced the Magic on March 29. The detailed stats in result [12] mention the Kings' lineup changes and their performance, but the actual outcome of the Kings vs. Magic game isn't explicitly stated there. \n\nWait, result [15] from The Score shows the Kings as 36-37 and Magic as 35-39 after the game. Since the Kings were 36-37 and the Magic 35-39 post-game, that implies the Kings won because their record improved from 35-37 (as in earlier results) to 36-37, while the Magic's record went from 35-38 to 35-39. Therefore, the Kings must have won the March 29 game, moving to 36-37, and the Magic dropped to 35-39. \n\nAdditionally, result [9] from NBC Sports mentions the Kings' odds and predictions, but the key info is in result [15], which shows the post-game records. Therefore, the Sacramento Kings won the game on March 29, leading to a resolution of p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Sacramento Kings defeated the Orlando Magic in their NBA game on March 29, 2025. Post-game records show the Kings improved to 36-37, while the Magic fell to 35-39[15]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided, where a Kings victory corresponds to **p2**.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
