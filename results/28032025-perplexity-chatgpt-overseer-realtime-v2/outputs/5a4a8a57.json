        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Warriors vs. Pelicans game on March 28, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Warriors win, it's p2; Pelicans win, p1; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 28, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the game's outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources report on the game. Result [2] from CBS Sports states that the Warriors beat the Pelicans 111-95. The AP recap confirms Stephen Curry's return and the Warriors' victory. Similarly, result [3] from Fox Sports and [8] from ESPN both list the final score as 111-95 in favor of the Warriors. The YouTube highlights in [5] and [7] also support this outcome, showing the Warriors' key plays leading to their win. \n\nThe Pelicans were missing key players like Zion Williamson, which might have affected their performance, but the result is clear. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game being played as scheduled with the Warriors winning. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Warriors). \n\nI need to ensure that the event in question is exactly the one mentioned. The date, teams, and outcome all match the user's query. No conflicting information is present. All sources agree on the result, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden State Warriors defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 111-95 in their March 28, 2025 matchup at Smoothie King Center[2][3][8]. Stephen Curry led the Warriors with 23 points in his return from injury, supported by Jimmy Butler's 18 points and 10 rebounds[2][6]. The Warriors overcame a 12-point first-quarter deficit with an 8-0 third-quarter run sparked by Curry and Brandin Podziemski's three-pointers[3][6].\n\nKey factors in the outcome:\n- **Warriors' defensive adjustments**: Held the Pelicans to 13 fourth-quarter points after trailing 82-81 late in the third[3][7]\n- **Pelicans' roster limitations**: Played without four starters including Zion Williamson (lower back injury)[2][6]\n- **Bench contributions**: Warriors reserves combined for 39 points compared to Pelicans' 26[6]\n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, meeting all specified resolution conditions. Market resolution aligns with the ancillary data's p2 parameter for a Warriors victory.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the instruction to report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It provides a detailed account of the game, including scores and key players, which supports the resolution recommendation. The response also checks for any possible postponements or cancellations, confirming none occurred.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and confirms the Warriors' victory. This aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Warriors win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not omit any crucial information necessary for resolving the query based on the user prompt and system instructions.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the specified conditions, and logical consistency in the response, the recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Warriors win) is justified and well-supported.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple reliable sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and logically supports the resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively utilized available information to confirm the event details and outcome, aligning the resolution recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411811 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:03:31 UTC"
