The ancillary data specifies that if the Clippers win, it's p2; if the Nets win, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query mentions March 28 at 7:30 PM ET. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Now, I need to check the search results for the outcome.\n\nLooking at the sources, several articles and videos report the game's result. Source [9] from the LA Times states the Clippers won 132-100. Source [10] from CBS Sports also confirms the Clippers' victory with the same score. Additionally, source [12] from SI mentions the Nets lost 132-100, and source [8] on Fox Sports lists the final score as a Clippers win. Multiple YouTube highlights (sources [3], [5], [7], [11], [13], [15]) from March 29, 2025, post-game, also support this outcome.\n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the Clippers won, so the resolution should be p2. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources align, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Brooklyn Nets 132-100 on March 28, 2025, in a game that was played as scheduled at Barclays Center. Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers with 31 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 steals, while Ivica Zubac added 21 points and 12 rebounds[9][10][12]. The Clippers dominated after a close first quarter, outscoring Brooklyn 42-21 in the second quarter and 37-21 in the third to secure their 10th win in 12 games[9][12]. \n\nKey factors in the outcome included:\n- **Clippers' offensive efficiency**: Shot 75% in the third quarter[5][11] and 54.4% overall from the field[1]\n- **Defensive dominance**: Forced 18 turnovers and held Brooklyn to 40.7% shooting[12]\n- **Bench production**: Norman Powell contributed 22 points off the bench[8]\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **\"Clippers\"** (p2) as the decisive winner.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410032 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:33:52 UTC"
