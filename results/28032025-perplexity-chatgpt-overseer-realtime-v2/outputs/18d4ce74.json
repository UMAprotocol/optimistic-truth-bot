The ancillary data specifies that if the Stars win, it's p2 (Stars), if the Kraken win, p1 (Kraken), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 29, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [5], [6], [7]) report that the Dallas Stars won the game 5-1. For example, source [1] states, \"Robertson, Oettinger lead Stars to 5-1 playoff-clinching victory over Kraken,\" and source [3] confirms the same score. The detailed game recap in [5] also mentions the Stars' victory with specific goal details. \n\nSince the game was played and the Stars won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the outcome, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Dallas Stars defeated the Seattle Kraken 5-1 in their March 29, 2025 NHL game, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][3][5][6][7]. The Stars secured a playoff berth with this victory, scoring three power-play goals and dominating key statistical categories like face-off wins (55-44%) despite being outshot 35-21[1][5]. This outcome occurred on the scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][3][5][6][7].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of event, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (NHL game between Dallas Stars and Seattle Kraken on March 29, 2025) and correctly notes the current date as March 31, 2025, confirming that the event is in the past. The response uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the game, which is a win by the Dallas Stars. This is in line with the instructions to use verified facts and concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt regarding the resolution conditions (p1 for Kraken win, p2 for Stars win, p3 for cancellation). It correctly concludes that since the Stars won, the market should resolve to p2. The reasoning is clear and follows a logical sequence from verifying the date, checking the event outcome, and applying the resolution conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, which all agree that the Dallas Stars won the game. This verification process aligns well with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Stars win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any reliance on unverified or irrelevant sources and sticks strictly to the event in question as outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the provided instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified facts and the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple sources, logically applies the resolution conditions, and aligns the recommendation with the verified facts without any errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the instructions, uses verified sources to confirm the event outcome, and provides a clear and accurate recommendation based on the user prompt's conditions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411179 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:52:59 UTC"
