        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Edgar Chairez vs. CJ Vergara fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Vergara, p2 is Chairez, and p3 is a draw or unresolved. The current date is March 30, 2025, so the event date (March 29) is in the past. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred and determine the outcome. The search results include several sources. Let's look through them. \n\nResult [5] from Wikipedia lists the results of the event. Under the preliminary card, it shows Edgar Chairez vs. CJ Vergara, but the result isn't filled in. Wait, no\u2014looking again, the main card has \u00c9dgar Ch\u00e1irez vs. C.J. Vergara, but the method and result columns are empty. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the Wikipedia page wasn't updated yet. \n\nLooking at result [1], the ESPN fight center page, under the Flyweight section, it lists \u00c9dgar Ch\u00e1irez vs. CJ Vergara with Mexico and USA flags, but no result mentioned. However, result [2] from Sherdog has a live play-by-play but the official result isn't shown. The other results, like [6], [7], [11], [12], [14], and [15], are pre-fight analyses or previews, so they don't have the outcome. \n\nWait, result [5] (Wikipedia) has a results table. Let me check again. The main card section lists \u00c9dgar Ch\u00e1irez vs. C.J. Vergara, but the method, round, time, and notes are blank. However, in the preliminary card section, other fights have results, like Jamall Emmers winning by TKO. But Chairez vs. Vergara isn't listed there. Wait, the main card's Flyweight entry is Chairez vs. Vergara, but no result is filled in. That's odd. Maybe the Wikipedia page wasn't updated post-fight. \n\nLooking at result [13], the ESPN fight center again, under Flyweight, it lists \u00c9dgar Ch\u00e1irez and CJ Vergara with Mexico and USA flags, but no result. The main event is Moreno vs. Erceg, but the other fights don't show results here either. \n\nResult [2] from Sherdog's live play-by-play includes the fight in the main card, but the official result isn't listed. The page seems to be a live blog that wasn't completed. \n\nResult [4] is a pre-fight interview with Chairez, and result [6] is about his training, both before the fight. Result [7] is a preview predicting Chairez to win by decision. \n\nWait, result [5]'s Wikipedia page has a results table. Let me check again. The main card lists \u00c9dgar Ch\u00e1irez vs. C.J. Vergara, but the result isn't filled. However, looking at the preliminary card results, there's a Flyweight bout between Kevin Borjas and Ronaldo Rodr\u00edguez where Borjas won by decision. But no mention of Chairez vs. Vergara's result. \n\nThis is confusing. Since the event date is March 29, 2025, and the current date is March 30, the fight should have happened. But none of the search results explicitly state the outcome. However, result [1] from ESPN's fight center might have the result embedded. Let me check again. \n\nIn result [1], under the Flyweight section, there's a line: \"\u00c9dgarCh\u00e1irez. 11-6-0. ESPN2/ESPN+. CJVergara. 12-6-1. Mexico. -270. +220. USA.\" The numbers here might be the betting odds, not the result. The \"-270\" for Chairez indicates he was the favorite. But that's pre-fight. \n\nSince all the search results provided are either pre-fight or live coverage without the final result, and the user's current date is March 30, 2025, the event has passed. However, the available sources don't provide the outcome. According to the resolution conditions, if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, we assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data says p2 is Chairez. The pre-fight analyses, like result [7], predicted Chairez to win by decision. He was the favorite in betting odds (e.g., result [12] has Chairez at -270). Given the lack of post-fight results in the provided sources, but the event date has passed, the resolution would default to the most probable outcome, which is Chairez winning. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between \u00c9dgar Ch\u00e1irez and C.J. Vergara took place on March 29, 2025, in Mexico City. Based on the ancillary data provided, the market resolves to \"Ch\u00e1irez\" (p2) if he wins, \"Vergara\" (p1) if he wins, or p3 for unresolved cases.  \n\n**Key analysis:**  \n- The event occurred on March 29, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 30, 2025)[1][2][5][12][14].  \n- No verifiable post-fight results are explicitly listed in the provided sources, as they primarily include pre-fight previews, betting odds, and live updates without final outcomes[1][2][4][5][7][12][14].  \n- Ch\u00e1irez entered as a significant favorite (-270 odds) with analysts predicting a decision win due to his reach, power, and grappling advantages[3][7][12][14]. Vergara\u2019s recent losses and passive style further supported this outlook[7][11].  \n- Per resolution conditions, if no verifiable outcome exists but the event date has passed, the resolution defaults to the **most probable outcome** based on ancillary data and pre-fight context[1][7][12].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
