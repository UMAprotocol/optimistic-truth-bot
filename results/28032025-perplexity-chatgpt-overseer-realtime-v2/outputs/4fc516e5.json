The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Edgar Chairez vs. CJ Vergara fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Chairez wins, it's p2; if Vergara wins, p1; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 29, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The fight was scheduled for March 29, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 31, 2025. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to determine the official result.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] states the official result as Edgar Chairez defeating CJ Vergara by submission (rear-naked choke) in the first round. Source [3] corroborates this with details of the fight, and source [4] mentions Chairez's emotional victory and the method of submission. Additionally, source [11] provides a round-by-round account, confirming the submission win for Chairez.\n\nAll credible sources agree that Chairez won the bout. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. The resolution conditions state that the source should be ESPN, but a consensus of credible reporting can be used. Since multiple reputable outlets (Cageside Press, Sportskeeda, MMA Junkie) report Chairez's victory, the consensus is clear.\n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to p2, corresponding to Chairez as the winner.\n</think>\n\nEdgar Chairez defeated C.J. Vergara via first-round submission (rear-naked choke) at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The official result[1][3][11] and multiple credible reports confirm Chairez secured the victory at 2:30 of Round 1 after dropping Vergara twice and applying the fight-ending choke[1][4]. The bout occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation[6], and all resolution conditions were met through verifiable fight outcomes[1][3][4][11].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Edgar Chairez vs. CJ Vergara fight at UFC Fight Night) and the date it occurred (March 29, 2025). It adheres to the instructions by verifying the outcome through multiple credible sources and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The response uses a consensus of credible reporting to confirm Edgar Chairez's victory, which is in line with the user prompt's allowance for using such a consensus if the primary source (ESPN) is not mentioned as the exclusive source.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the event's occurrence to the verification of the outcome. It checks the date, confirms the event has occurred, and verifies the winner through multiple sources. The response is thorough in detailing the fight's outcome and ensuring no conditions such as postponement or cancellation were met that would alter the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event against the scheduled date and confirms that it took place as planned. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Chairez winning) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the fight.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response does not rely on unnecessary information and sticks to the facts required to resolve the query.\n\nGiven the above points, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
