        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 28, 2025, based on the provided search results. The resolution conditions specify that the answer is \"Yes\" if the executive order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. Otherwise, it's \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of an executive order signed on March 28. Let's go through each source. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [3] mentions an executive order issued on March 18, 2025, titled \u201cAchieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness\u201d. That's not the date we need. \n\nResult [5] is an article from March 28, 2025, criticizing an executive order signed on March 25. Wait, March 25 is before March 28, so that's not relevant here. \n\nResult [6] from Littler's Executive Order Tracker, updated March 29, 2025, lists several executive orders. Under March 27, there's one about national security and labor relations, and another about historical sites. March 24 entries include orders on Venezuela and TikTok. But nothing on March 28. \n\nResult [7] from NAFSA mentions Executive Order 14224 on March 1, 2025, designating English as the official language. Again, not March 28. \n\nResult [9] is a fact sheet from February 19, 2025, about ending subsidies for illegal immigration. Result [10] is from January 20, 2025, about revoking previous orders. Result [12] is from March 6, 2025, regarding Bitcoin reserves. \n\nNone of the search results directly mention an executive order signed on March 28, 2025. The closest is result [5], which references an order from March 25, but that's three days prior. The user's query specifically asks about March 28. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if no executive order is published by 12 PM ET the next day (March 29), it resolves to \"No\". Since the search results don't show any executive orders on March 28 and the cutoff is March 29 at 12 PM ET, the answer should be \"No\". \n\nI need to make sure there's no mention in the White House's presidential actions page. The provided sources don't include any such publication for March 28. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\". \n\nrecommendation: p1\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did not sign an executive order on March 28, 2025, based on the available evidence. The search results include several executive orders from January, February, and early March 2025, but none dated March 28:\n\n1. **March 25, 2025**: An executive order on election integrity was signed[2][5], which drew criticism for its voter verification requirements and restrictions on non-citizen involvement in elections[5].\n2. **March 27, 2025**: Orders were issued regarding national security labor relations and historical site policies[6].\n3. **March 18, 2025**: An order focused on state/local preparedness and cybersecurity[3].\n\nThe resolution criteria require publication on the [White House presidential actions page](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) or in the Federal Register by 12 PM ET on March 29. None of the listed executive orders in the search results meet this specific date requirement, and no March 28 orders appear in the Federal Register excerpts provided[4]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on the specific date mentioned in the user prompt (March 28, 2025) and checking for the publication of an executive order on the White House's presidential actions page or the press pool by the specified deadline (12 PM ET on March 29, 2025). The response correctly identifies that no executive order was signed or published on March 28, 2025, as per the sources checked.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the relevant dates around March 28, 2025, and confirms that no executive order was issued on that specific date. It also correctly interprets the resolution conditions that if no executive order is published by the deadline, the market resolves to \"No\".\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the absence of an executive order on the specified date using the appropriate sources as outlined in the user prompt. The recommendation to resolve as \"No\" (p1) aligns with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified and uses the correct sources for verification.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It accurately and completely addresses the user prompt with a logical and well-supported recommendation.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743408955 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:15:55 UTC",
