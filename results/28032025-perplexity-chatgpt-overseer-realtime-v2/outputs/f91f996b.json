The ancillary data specifies that a visit is defined as physically entering Greenland's territory, and airspace doesn't count. The resolution sources are official U.S. government info, Vance's verified accounts, or credible reporting.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources confirming Vance's visit. Source [1] mentions he was at Pituffik Space Base on March 28, 2025. That's within the timeframe. Source [4] also details his remarks there on the same date. Other sources like [3], [6], and [8] corroborate the visit, noting the itinerary change but confirming he did go. The dates are all within March, so well before June 30. Since the visit is confirmed by multiple credible reports and official statements, the answer should be \"Yes,\" which corresponds to p2. No conflicting info found, so recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nVice President JD Vance visited Greenland's Pituffik Space Base on March 28, 2025, as confirmed by multiple credible reports[1][4][6][8]. This visit occurred within the specified timeframe of March 26 to June 30, 2025, meeting the market's resolution criteria for a \"Yes\" outcome. The trip included physical entry into Greenland's territory, with Vance conducting official briefings and addressing U.S. troops at the military installation[4][7].
