The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland between March 26 and June 30, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the dates. The current date is March 28, 2025. The search results mention that Vance's visit to Greenland is happening on March 28. Multiple sources like CBS News, The Independent, and PBS all state that the visit is scheduled for March 28. \n\nNext, the definition of a visit is Vance physically entering Greenland's territory. The search results indicate that Vance is visiting the Pituffik Space Base, which is a U.S. military installation in Greenland. Even though it's a U.S. base, it's located within Greenland's territory, so that counts. \n\nThe resolution sources include official U.S. government information or credible reporting. The sources provided are all credible news outlets reporting on the visit. Additionally, Vance's own tweet (cited in source 11) confirms his plans to visit on March 28. \n\nThere's no mention of the visit being canceled or postponed. In fact, sources mention that the itinerary was adjusted to avoid public events but the visit to the military base proceeded. \n\nSince the visit occurred within the specified timeframe and meets the definition, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). All conditions are met with multiple credible sources confirming the visit on March 28.\n</think>\n\nVice President JD Vance visited Greenland on **March 28, 2025**, as confirmed by multiple credible sources. The trip included a visit to the U.S. Space Force\u2019s Pituffik Base in northwestern Greenland[1][2][5][6][9][12]. While the itinerary was revised to avoid public events due to local opposition, the physical presence of Vance in Greenland\u2019s territory during the specified timeframe (March 26\u2013June 30, 2025) is unequivocally documented. \n\nOfficial U.S. government statements, including Vance\u2019s own social media announcement[11], and consensus reporting from outlets like CBS News, PBS, and ABC News confirm the visit occurred as scheduled. The definition of a \"visit\" (physical entry into Greenland\u2019s territory) is satisfied by his presence at the Pituffik Base, which is located within Greenland\u2019s borders[6][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743180745 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-28 16:52:25 UTC",
