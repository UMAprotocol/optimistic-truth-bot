        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said \"Big Balls\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The main sources are the interview transcript and related articles. From the search results, the interview was aired on FOX News, and there's a detailed transcript in source [6]. Let me look through that. \n\nIn the transcript from source [6], Bret Baier interviews Musk and several DOGE members. I'll scan through the conversation for any mention of \"Big Balls\". The transcript includes Musk discussing various topics like government efficiency, budget cuts, and responses to criticism. However, there's no mention of the term \"Big Balls\" in the quoted parts. \n\nOther sources mention Edward Coristine, known as \"Big Balls\", but they don't indicate that Musk used the term during the interview. Source [2] notes that Musk left out Edward Coristine from the interview. Source [3], [4], and [5] discuss Coristine's nickname but don't link it to Musk's statements in the interview. \n\nAdditionally, source [7] and [8] discuss the interview's content but again, no reference to Musk saying \"Big Balls\". The key point here is that while the nickname is associated with a DOGE employee, the interview itself, as per the transcript, doesn't have Musk uttering the phrase. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that any usage of the term by Musk during the interview counts. Since the transcript and related coverage don't show Musk using \"Big Balls\", the answer should be \"No\". The interview was released by the deadline, so the resolution is based on the content available. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided search results and the full transcript of Elon Musk's March 27, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on FOX News, there is no evidence that Musk uttered the term \"Big Balls\" during the conversation[1][6][7]. The interview focused on DOGE's government efficiency initiatives, budget cuts, and responses to criticism, but Musk avoided mentioning Edward Coristine (the 19-year-old DOGE staffer known by that nickname) despite his prominence in media coverage[2][3][4][5].\n\nKey points supporting this resolution:\n- The official transcript shows Musk discussing operational details of DOGE's work but makes no reference to \"Big Balls\"[6]\n- Multiple sources note Musk deliberately excluded Coristine from the interview panel[2][7]\n- While news outlets extensively discussed the \"Big Balls\" nickname in relation to DOGE staffers, these references came from external reporting rather than the interview itself[3][4][5]\n- The interview aired in full by the March 28 deadline without any reported technical issues or omissions[1][6]\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be thorough and well-aligned with the requirements of the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the user prompt, focusing on whether Elon Musk said \"Big Balls\" during the interview with Bret Baier. The AI checked the transcript and related articles, confirming that the term was not used by Musk during the interview. This is in line with the user prompt's requirement to resolve the market based on the specific occurrence of the term.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with an explanation of the task, followed by a detailed examination of the transcript and related sources. It concludes that since the term was not mentioned by Musk, the market should resolve to \"No\". The reasoning is clear, and the AI provides a comprehensive review of the relevant sources to ensure the term was not mentioned.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI correctly identifies the event (the interview) and verifies through multiple sources that the term \"Big Balls\" was not mentioned by Musk. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) is based on concrete evidence from the transcript and corroborated by additional sources.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI effectively uses the sources mentioned in the user prompt and does not stray from the event specified. It also correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is accurate, complete, and adheres to the instructions provided. It effectively uses the available information to make a well-supported recommendation.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and comprehensively analyzes the event in question, adhering to the user prompt and system instructions. It provides a well-supported recommendation based on verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm that the term 'Big Balls' was not mentioned by Elon Musk during the interview, aligning with the resolution conditions and making a correct market resolution recommendation.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743221574 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 04:12:54 UTC",
