The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Loopy Godinez vs. Julia Polastri fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Godinez wins, it's p2; Polastri is p1, and a draw or unresolved by April 29, 2025, is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 31, 2025, and the fight was on March 29, so it's already happened. That means I don't have to worry about future dates. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the provided sources. Let's look through the search results. \n\nSearch result [2] from mmadecisions.com clearly states that Lupita Godinez defeated Julia Polastri by unanimous decision. The judges' scores were 29-28 across all three, with media scores also favoring Godinez. This is a primary source for fight results.\n\nResult [10] from sportsnet.ca confirms the same outcome, mentioning all three judges scored it 29-28 for Godinez. Additionally, [4] and [9] also report Godinez's victory. There's consistent reporting across multiple sources that Godinez won. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that ESPN is the primary source, but a consensus of credible reporting can be used. Even though the direct ESPN link [11] is a live stream and doesn't have text results, the other sources like mmadecisions, sportsnet, and mmajunkie are credible and all agree. \n\nNo sources mention a draw or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All evidence points to Godinez winning, which according to the ancillary data, should resolve to p2. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all the search results align. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between Loopy Godinez and Julia Polastri took place on March 29, 2025, as scheduled. According to multiple verified sources, **Loopy Godinez won the fight via unanimous decision** with all three judges scoring the bout 29-28 in her favor[2][10]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided, where a Godinez victory corresponds to **p2**. \n\nKey details supporting this resolution:\n- Official scorecards from MMADecisions.com show Godinez winning Rounds 1 and 2 on all judges' cards, while Polastri took Round 3[2].\n- Sportsnet reported Godinez \"snapped a two-fight losing streak\" with this victory, emphasizing her control in the first two rounds despite Polastri's late rally[10].\n- Bloody Elbow documented Godinez overcoming adversity mid-fight to secure the decision win[4].\n\nNo credible sources indicate a draw, cancellation, or postponement. The event occurred before the April 29, 2025, cutoff date specified in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

It uses multiple credible sources to verify the outcome of the fight, which is a key requirement of the system prompt. The response adheres to the instruction to use a consensus of credible reporting since the primary source (ESPN) did not provide a text result.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the event date, searches for credible sources, and confirms the outcome without any ambiguity. It correctly aligns the outcome with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, recommending resolution p2 for a Godinez win, which matches the conditions set forth.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event occurred as scheduled and that Godinez won by unanimous decision. This is supported by multiple sources, and no credible sources contradict this outcome. The recommendation of p2 is directly aligned with the ancillary data and the verified event outcome.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response does not rely on a single source but corroborates the outcome with multiple reports, enhancing its reliability.\n\nGiven the thorough verification process, accurate alignment with the ancillary data, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple credible sources, aligns perfectly with the ancillary data, and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively utilized multiple sources to confirm the event outcome, adhered to the resolution conditions, and provided a clear and accurate recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411562 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:59:22 UTC",
