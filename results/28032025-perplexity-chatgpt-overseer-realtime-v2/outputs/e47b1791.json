        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said \"Rubio\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of the interview. Looking through the sources, there are a few relevant ones. Source [9] from Axios confirms the interview was scheduled for March 27 on Fox News. Source [13] and [14] mention that the interview did air on March 28, 2025, as part of a charm offensive by Musk and the DOGE team. \n\nNow, the key is to find if \"Rubio\" was mentioned. Source [5] is a blog post from March 28 that discusses the interview but doesn't mention Rubio. Source [13] (Newser) and [14] (Axios) provide summaries of the interview content, focusing on Musk's comments about government efficiency and the DOGE team's work. Neither of these mention Rubio. Source [15] (DNyuz) also covers the interview, highlighting Musk's statements about improving government but again no mention of Rubio. \n\nAdditionally, source [16] discusses the alleged feud between Musk and Rubio but doesn't link it to the Baier interview. The other sources about the feud are from before the interview date. Since the interview was on March 27 and the current date is March 29, the interview has already taken place and been released. \n\nSince none of the search results indicate that Musk mentioned \"Rubio\" during the interview, and the resolution conditions state that if the term isn't used, it resolves to \"No\", the answer should be p1. However, I need to be careful. The user provided a URL in the query (axios.com) which is source [9], and the instruction says to heavily bias towards URLs provided. But the Axios source [9] is about the announcement, not the actual interview content. The actual interview content is covered in sources [13], [14], [15], which don't mention Rubio. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information, Musk did not say \"Rubio\" during the interview. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nElon Musk's March 27, 2025 interview with Bret Baier aired as scheduled, with multiple sources confirming its occurrence[9][13][14]. The interview focused on Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives and cost-cutting measures, but no evidence exists in available records that Musk uttered the word \"Rubio\" during the broadcast.\n\nKey details:\n- The Fox News interview occurred during Baier's 6 PM ET timeslot as planned[9]\n- Multiple outlets described the content as centered on government restructuring[13][14][15]\n- Search results include detailed summaries of discussion topics but make no mention of Secretary of State Marco Rubio[13][14][15]\n- The only post-interview Rubio-related coverage concerns their earlier cabinet clash[16], not the Baier interview\n\nGiven the resolution conditions requiring verifiable evidence from the interview's audio/video recording, and the absence of any documented reference to \"Rubio\" in available reports about the broadcast, the market resolves to \"No.\"\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be thorough and well-reasoned, adhering closely to the instructions provided in the system prompt. Here is a detailed evaluation based on the criteria provided:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event in question (Elon Musk's interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025) and checks multiple sources to verify whether the term \"Rubio\" was mentioned. The response adheres to the instruction to focus on verified facts and concrete evidence, using multiple sources to confirm the occurrence of the interview and the content discussed therein.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources, concluding that the term \"Rubio\" was not mentioned during the interview. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt, determining that the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1) based on the absence of the term \"Rubio\" in any documented sources about the interview.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and aligns the recommendation with the facts gathered from reliable sources. It correctly identifies that the interview took place as scheduled and provides a detailed account of the topics covered, none of which included the term \"Rubio.\"\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or significant biases in the response. The AI has correctly prioritized information from the sources specified in the user prompt and has not shown any undue bias towards irrelevant information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) is well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the non-occurrence of the term 'Rubio' during the interview, aligns with the resolution conditions, and adheres closely to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-reasoned, effectively using multiple sources to confirm the details of the event and the absence of the specified term.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743220810 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 04:00:10 UTC",
