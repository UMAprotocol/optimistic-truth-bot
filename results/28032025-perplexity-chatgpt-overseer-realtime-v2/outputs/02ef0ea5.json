The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Vegas Golden Knights vs. Chicago Blackhawks game on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Golden Knights win, it's p2 (Golden Knights), if the Blackhawks win, p1 (Blackhawks), and other conditions for postponement or cancellation. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query says the game was scheduled for March 28 at 8:30 PM ET. The current date provided is March 29, 2025, 9:00:33 AM UTC, which is the next day. So the game has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 6, 9, 14) report that the Golden Knights won the game 5-3. For example, source 1's title states, \"Golden Knights overcome Donato's hat trick to beat Blackhawks 5-3 for 5th straight win.\" The detailed recaps mention the final score and key players, confirming the Golden Knights' victory. \n\nI should check if there's any conflicting information. Other sources (3, 4) discuss a previous game on February 27 where the Golden Knights also won, but that's a different date. The query is specifically about the March 28 game. All recent sources from March 29 consistently report the Golden Knights' win. \n\nNo sources mention the game being postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that if the game is completed, the result is based on the winner. Since the game happened and the Golden Knights won, the correct resolution is p2 (Golden Knights). \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Vegas Golden Knights defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 5-3 in their NHL game on March 28, 2025, at United Center. Multiple sources confirm the Golden Knights secured their fifth consecutive win, overcoming a hat trick by Chicago's Ryan Donato[1][2][6][14]. Key contributions came from Pavel Dorofeyev's power-play goal late in the third period and Victor Olofsson's two goals[1][14]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, and no evidence suggests unresolved contingencies. \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to \"Golden Knights\" (p2) as Vegas won the game.  \nrecommendation: p2",

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a win by the Golden Knights corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by confirming the date and time of the game, checking multiple sources for the game's outcome, and ensuring there is no conflicting information about the game being postponed or canceled. The response also correctly ignores irrelevant information about a previous game on a different date, focusing solely on the event specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe recommendation of p2 is well-supported by the evidence provided, including multiple sources confirming the Golden Knights' victory. The response also correctly identifies that the game concluded without any postponement or cancellation, which matches the conditions outlined for resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, ensuring that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743238761 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 08:59:21 UTC"
