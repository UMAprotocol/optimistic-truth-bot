If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Boston Celtics vs. San Antonio Spurs game scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Celtics win, the market resolves to \"Celtics\" (p2), if the Spurs win, it's \"Spurs\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current date provided is March 30, 2025, 2:21:50 AM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. So the game should have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game on March 29. For example, source [4] from CBS Sports gives a detailed preview, mentioning the Celtics' seven-game winning streak and the Spurs' lineup. However, the key is to find post-game results. \n\nWait, source [8] from SI.com mentions a starting lineup change for the Spurs on March 30, 2025, which might be a typo since the game was scheduled for March 29. Source [10] from Fox Sports shows a box score for the game dated March 29, 2025, but the page content seems to be a placeholder without actual results. Similarly, source [14] from ESPN's live score page doesn't list the final score, only previous games. \n\nOther sources like [1], [2], [5], [6], [7], [11], [12], and [13] are all previews or predictions before the game. They all predict a Celtics win, but predictions aren't actual results. \n\nNotably, source [4] (CBS Sports) mentions the Celtics' recent win against the Suns and their strong road record, but it's a preview, not a result. Source [8] (SI.com) talks about a lineup change but doesn't provide the game's outcome. \n\nSince all the provided search results are either previews, predictions, or incomplete data, there's no direct mention of the game's actual result. The current date is March 30, so the game should have happened, but the available sources don't confirm the outcome. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The predictions heavily favor the Celtics, with sources [1], [5], [6], [7], and [11] all indicating a Celtics win. However, without explicit confirmation from a post-game report, strictly following the rules, if there's no verifiable information, we should default to p4. Wait, the ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions unless contradicted. \n\nSince all previews point to a Celtics win and no sources contradict that, the resolution should be p2 (Celtics). However, the strict rule says if no verifiable info, but the event date is past, assume most probable. But the instructions also say if the user provides URLs, use them heavily. The URLs provided don't have the actual result, so technically, we can't confirm. But the market resolution rules say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable. Given the overwhelming predictions, the recommendation would be p2. However, the strictest interpretation might require p4 if no result is found. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Celtics vs. San Antonio Spurs NBA game scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET was analyzed based on available sources. The Celtics entered the game with a 54-19 record and a seven-game winning streak, while the Spurs were 31-41 and missing key players like Victor Wembanyama and De'Aaron Fox[4][6][8]. Pre-game predictions heavily favored Boston, citing their league-best road record (30-7) and offensive firepower led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown[1][5][6][7]. \n\nKey factors included:\n- **Celtics' dominance**: Ranked 2nd in the Eastern Conference with a +9.1 average scoring margin[7].\n- **Spurs' lineup changes**: Jeremy Sochan returned to the starting lineup, but San Antonio faced defensive challenges against Boston's three-point-heavy offense[8][11].\n- **Injury status**: Tatum was cleared to play after missing one game, while the Spurs remained without Wembanyama and Fox[6][8].\n\nNo verifiable post-game results were found in the provided sources as of March 30, 2025. However, ancillary data specifies that if no outcome is reported for a past-dated event, the resolution defaults to the most probable outcome based on pre-game conditions. Given the Celtics' overwhelming favoritism in predictions and superior season performance, the recommended resolution aligns with the ancillary data's p2 (\"Celtics\") outcome.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
