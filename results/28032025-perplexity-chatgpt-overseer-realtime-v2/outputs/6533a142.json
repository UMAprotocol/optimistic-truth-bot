The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Nets vs. Wizards game scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Nets win, it's p2; if the Wizards win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is two days after the scheduled game. Looking at the search results, several sources (9, 10, 11, 12, 13) report that the game was played on March 29, 2025. The Nets won 115-112. For example, source 9 mentions Drew Timme's go-ahead basket with 7.7 seconds left, leading to a Nets victory. \n\nNext, I need to confirm there's no indication of postponement or cancellation. The search results don't mention any delays or cancellations; instead, they provide detailed game summaries. Sources like 6 and 1 discuss NBA's policies on postponements, but since the game was played, those rules don't apply here. \n\nSince the game was completed as scheduled and the Nets won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Nets). There's no need to consider postponement or cancellation because the game happened. All the evidence points to a completed game with a clear outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets defeated the Washington Wizards 115-112 in their March 29, 2025 game, which was played as scheduled. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred with Drew Timme scoring the go-ahead basket in the final seconds[9][10][11][12][13]. Since the game was completed without postponement or cancellation, the market resolves based on the outcome.  \n\n**Resolution**: The Nets won, so the market resolves to **p2 (Nets)**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Nets vs. Wizards game on March 29, 2025) and verifies that it occurred as scheduled without any postponements or cancellations. The outcome of the game is reported with specific details, including the final score and a key play by Drew Timme, which aligns with the user prompt's requirement to report based on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first verifying the occurrence of the event, then confirming there were no disruptions like postponements or cancellations, and finally determining the outcome based on the game's result. This step-by-step analysis ensures that all necessary aspects are covered before arriving at a resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses multiple sources to confirm the event's occurrence and outcome, which satisfies the requirement for verification through reliable sources. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Nets win) directly corresponds to the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the event specified in the user prompt and used multiple sources to confirm the details, ensuring a reliable and unbiased resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409264 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:21:04 UTC"
