The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve based on the game's outcome. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game on March 29, 2025, with detailed highlights and box scores. Sources [4], [6], [8], [10], [11], and [12] all confirm the game took place. For example, source [8] from the AP recap states the Orioles won 9-5. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. The user provided some search results about a postponed game, but those are from 2024 (sources [2] and [5]), which is irrelevant here. The 2025 game on March 29 proceeded as planned.\n\nThe game started and was completed, as per the detailed play-by-play in sources [4] and [6], and the final score in [8] and [11]. There's no mention of the game being suspended or not completed. The official outcome from MLB, as reported by ESPN and AP, has the Orioles winning 9-5. \n\nSince the game was played to completion and the Orioles won, according to the resolution conditions, p2 (Orioles) should be the correct resolution. All the sources align on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The ancillary data's conditions are met, and the official MLB result is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 9-5 in their March 29, 2025, MLB game at Rogers Centre. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with the Orioles erasing a 4-2 deficit by scoring four runs in the fourth inning. Key performances included Jordan Westburg's two solo home runs and Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas' three-run double[8][11]. Max Scherzer left the game after three innings due to right lat soreness, but the game was completed under MLB rules[4][8].  \n\nThe official MLB outcome confirms the Orioles as the winner, meeting all resolution criteria outlined in the ancillary data. No suspensions, ties, or incomplete rulings affected the result.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411077 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:51:17 UTC",
