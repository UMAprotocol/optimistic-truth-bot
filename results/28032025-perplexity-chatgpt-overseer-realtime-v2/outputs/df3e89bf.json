The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to the winner as per MLB rules, with p1 for Padres, p2 for Braves, and p3 for a tie or unresolved. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 28. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game. \n\nResult [3] from baseball-almanac.com states the Padres won 4-3 on March 28. Result [5] from Deadspin details Jake Cronenworth's game-winning homer in the 8th inning, leading the Padres to a 4-3 victory. Result [6] also mentions the Padres sweeping the series, including the March 28 game. Additionally, result [13] is a YouTube highlight confirming the Padres' win.\n\nAll these sources consistently report the Padres as the winners. The MLB's official outcome would reflect this, so the resolution should be p1 (Padres). There's no mention of the game being postponed or suspended, so the conditions for p3 don't apply. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe San Diego Padres defeated the Atlanta Braves 4-3 on March 28, 2025, in a game that featured late-inning heroics from Jake Cronenworth. His tie-breaking solo home run in the bottom of the eighth inning off Dylan Lee proved decisive[3][5][13]. The Padres' bullpen held the Braves scoreless over the final four innings, with Robert Suarez securing the save[5]. This outcome aligns with the official MLB result recorded for the game[3][5][6].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the MLB game between the Atlanta Braves and the San Diego Padres on March 28, 2025. The response adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt and aligns with the ancillary data requirements.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event's date and checks its occurrence against the current date to confirm it is in the past. It then proceeds to gather evidence from multiple reliable sources, including baseball-almanac.com and Deadspin, which consistently report the Padres' victory. This approach adheres to the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts and the official MLB outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the information from various sources to confirm the game's outcome. It correctly applies the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, determining that the Padres' win aligns with the resolution condition p1. The response also correctly ignores any conditions that did not occur, such as postponement or suspension of the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p1) with these facts. This ensures that the resolution is based on concrete evidence as required.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There is no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response thoroughly checks for different conditions (e.g., postponement, suspension) and confirms none of these applied before making a recommendation.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the requirements set out in the system prompt. It provides a well-reasoned, fact-based resolution to the query.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on verified facts and aligns with the ancillary data and system prompt requirements.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and applies the resolution conditions correctly.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411933 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:05:33 UTC",
