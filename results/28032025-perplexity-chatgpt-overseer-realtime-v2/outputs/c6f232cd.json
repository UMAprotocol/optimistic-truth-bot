The game was scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:09 PM ET. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the event has already occurred. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 28, with multiple sources reporting the outcome. For example, source [2] states that Michigan State won 73-70. Other sources like [4], [5], [6], [8], [9], and [10] all confirm the same score and outcome. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having been played on the scheduled date. There's no indication of any postponement or cancellation. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Michigan State wins, the market resolves to p1 (\"Michigan State\"). Since all the sources confirm Michigan State's victory, the resolution should be p1. \n\nI also need to check if there's any conflicting information. All the search results consistently report Michigan State's win, so there's no ambiguity. The final score was 73-70 in favor of Michigan State, as per multiple sources. \n\nTherefore, based on the verified outcome and the resolution conditions provided, the correct recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 game between Ole Miss and Michigan State occurred as scheduled on March 28, 2025, with Michigan State winning 73-70[2][4][6][8][9]. The Spartans overcame multiple deficits, including a nine-point second-half margin, to secure the victory and advance to the Elite Eight. Key performances included Jace Richardson's 24 points for Michigan State and Sean Pedulla's 24 points for Ole Miss[2][5][9].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up contingency was required. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1** (\"Michigan State\") as the Spartans won the game.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Ole Miss vs. Michigan State basketball game took place on March 28, 2025, and that Michigan State won with a score of 73-70. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a Michigan State win corresponds to a resolution of p1. The response does not predict future outcomes but rather reports on an event that has already occurred, which is in line with the system prompt requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for the occurrence of the game, its outcome, and any potential postponements or cancellations. It confirms the game was played as scheduled and that Michigan State won, leading to the resolution of p1. The response also ensures there is no conflicting information across multiple sources, which supports the reliability of the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (\"Michigan State\") is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt and uses verified sources to confirm the details necessary for resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412392 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:13:12 UTC"
