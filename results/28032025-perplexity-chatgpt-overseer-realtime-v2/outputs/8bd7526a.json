        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Adin Ross has been unbanned from Twitch by December 31, 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 29, 2025. The market resolves based on whether the unban happens by the end of 2025. But since the current date is March 29, 2025, any information after this date isn't available yet. However, the search results include sources up to March 29, 2025.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [9] from Sportskeeda, dated March 29, 2025, explicitly states that Twitch unbanned Adin Ross on that day. Another source, [10], also from March 29, 2025, confirms his unban and mentions his account is accessible again. These are recent and directly state the unban occurred on the current date. \n\nEarlier sources like [1] and [4] mentioned Ross's claims about being unbanned in seven days, which aligns with the March 29 date. Source [7] from March 23, 2025, discussed rumors of his unban, and [11] from March 23 also reported his announcement about the seven-day timeline. \n\nTwitch's updated moderation policies (source [1] and [4]) allowed for reinstatement after bans, which Ross might have utilized. The CEO's comments (source [5]) indicated that behavioral changes could lead to unbanning, and Ross had been working on that (source [4], [6], [8]). \n\nSince the unban happened on March 29, 2025, which is well before December 31, 2025, the resolution condition for \"Yes\" (p2) is met. The official sources (Twitch.com) aren't directly cited, but multiple credible reports (Sportskeeda, Gamerant) confirm the unban. Therefore, the answer should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nAdin Ross was officially unbanned from Twitch on March 29, 2025, as confirmed by multiple credible reports[9][10]. This occurred after a two-year ban initially imposed in February 2023 for displaying unmoderated Kick chat containing offensive content during a Twitch stream[10]. The reinstatement came following:\n\n- Twitch's updated moderation policies allowing banned creators to appeal after six months[1][4]\n- Public appeals from Ross and supporters like Kai Cenat[8]\n- Twitch CEO Dan Clancy's conditional openness to reinstatement if behavior improved[5][4]\n\nKey evidence includes:\n1. Sportskeeda's direct report stating \"Twitch unbanned popular live streamer Adin Ross on March 29, 2025\"[9]\n2. Restoration of Ross' Twitch channel with 7,500+ new followers immediately after unban[10]\n3. Fulfillment of Ross' own March 23 prediction about a 7-day unban timeline[1][11]\n\nAs this resolution occurred before the December 31, 2025 deadline specified in the ancillary data and meets the requirement for credible reporting consensus, the market resolves definitively to \"Yes.\"\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate and complete in addressing the user prompt regarding whether Adin Ross has been unbanned from Twitch by December 31, 2025. The response effectively uses the current date, March 29, 2025, to establish that the event in question is not in the future relative to the timestamp, thus adhering to the system prompt instructions that require the event to have already occurred for a resolution to be made.\n\nThe response is logically sound, as it bases its conclusion on multiple credible sources that confirm Ross's unbanning on March 29, 2025. This is well before the December 31, 2025 deadline. The response also correctly identifies the resolution condition for \"Yes\" (p2) based on the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The sources cited, including Sportskeeda and Gamerant, are considered reliable and relevant to the resolution of this query.\n\nFurthermore, the response adheres to the system prompt's requirement to verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. The response does not predict future outcomes but reports on what has definitively happened, which is in line with the system prompt instructions.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by directly verifying the information from Twitch.com, as specified in the user prompt, to strengthen the credibility of the resolution. While the response mentions that Twitch's official announcements would qualify, it does not explicitly confirm the unban from Twitch's own communications. Including this verification would align the response more closely with the user prompt's stipulation for primary resolution sources.\n\nOverall, the response is satisfactory as it stands, but the recommendation could be strengthened with direct confirmation from Twitch.com.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on credible sources confirming Adin Ross's unbanning from Twitch, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response could be improved by including direct verification from Twitch.com to align more closely with the user prompt's primary resolution source requirement.\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743281741 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 20:55:41 UTC"
