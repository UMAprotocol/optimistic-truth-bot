        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether there have been 500 or more confirmed measles cases in the U.S. in 2025 according to the CDC by March 28, 2025. The key here is to rely solely on the CDC's data as per the resolution source.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the CDC's reported numbers. Looking at the sources, there's a mix of information. The CDC's own page (source [5]) was updated on March 21, 2025, and states 378 confirmed cases. However, other sources like [9] and [12] mention higher numbers. For example, source [9] from March 29 says the Texas outbreak alone has 400 cases, and the U.S. total is approaching 500. Source [12] from March 28 cites the CDC confirming 483 cases. But wait, the user's note specifies that only CDC-reported cases count, not state agencies or others. \n\nHowever, source [14] (Xinhua) on March 28 quotes the CDC's latest data as 483 cases. But the CDC's own page (source [5]) hasn't been updated since March 21. There's a discrepancy here. The user's resolution source is the CDC's counter, which as of March 21 was at 378. But other sources claim the CDC reported 483 by March 28. This could be due to the CDC updating their page weekly on Fridays, as mentioned in source [5]. If the CDC's official update on March 28 (a Friday) showed 483 cases, then the answer is \"Yes\". However, the latest CDC data in the provided search results (source [5]) is from March 21. Without the March 28 update in the search results, but other sources citing the CDC's number as 483 by March 28, I need to verify which is accurate. \n\nThe user's note says if the CDC counter is unavailable, another credible source is used. But according to the search results, source [14] and [12] both reference the CDC's data as of March 28, stating 483 cases. Even though the direct CDC link in the search results (source [5]) hasn't been updated beyond March 21, the other sources are citing the CDC's later update. Since the resolution time is March 28, and the CDC's own data as reported by these sources reaches 483, the answer should be \"Yes\". Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nAs of March 28, 2025, the CDC's official measles case count reached **483 confirmed cases** according to multiple sources citing CDC data released on that date[12][14]. This exceeds the 500-case threshold specified in the resolution conditions, but the CDC's final count for March 28 fell just short at 483 cases. However, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported **400 cases in Texas alone** as of March 28[9][12], and other states contributed additional cases that brought the national total to 483 in CDC reporting[14].\n\nThe resolution conditions explicitly state that **only CDC-reported cases qualify**, overriding higher state-level numbers. While Texas' outbreak accounted for 83% of national cases, the CDC's March 28 tally of 483 remains below the 500-case threshold required for a \"Yes\" resolution. This discrepancy arises because:\n- The CDC updates its national count weekly, while states report cases in real-time\n- Some state-reported cases may not yet be included in CDC totals due to reporting delays\n- The CDC's March 21 update showed 378 cases[5], with a 7-day lag in reporting\n\n**recommendation: p1**",

It recognizes the potential for updates not reflected in the most recent direct CDC data available.\n   - It concludes that if the CDC's official update on March 28 showed 483 cases, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). However, it then correctly identifies that the number falls short of the 500-case threshold required for a \"Yes\" resolution, leading to a recommendation of \"No\" (p1).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response attempts to verify the event (number of measles cases) through multiple sources. However, it initially suggests a \"Yes\" resolution based on an incorrect threshold understanding before correctly adjusting to \"No\" due to the actual threshold of 500 cases not being met.\n   - The final recommendation aligns with the facts as the number reported (483 cases) does not meet the 500-case threshold.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The response initially misinterprets the threshold for resolution, suggesting a \"Yes\" when the number reported was below 500.\n   - It could improve by explicitly stating the need for the most recent and direct CDC data as of the resolution date, rather than relying on earlier data or secondary sources without confirmation.\n\n**Decision:**\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's requirements, correctly identifies the relevant data sources, and logically processes the information to arrive at a correct recommendation based on the facts provided.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409428 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:23:48 UTC",
