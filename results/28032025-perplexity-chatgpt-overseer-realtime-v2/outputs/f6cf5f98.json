The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the NBA game between the Portland Trail Blazers and the New York Knicks scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Knicks win, it's p1; if the Trail Blazers win, p2; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the game happened on March 30, which is the day before. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game's result. Source [1] from CBS Sports states the Knicks won 110-93. Source [2] from SI.com also mentions the Knicks' victory with a 110-93 score. Additionally, the YouTube highlights in source [13] and the game recap in source [6] both corroborate the Knicks' win. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All the evidence points to the game having taken place as scheduled with the Knicks emerging victorious. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the correct resolution is p1 for the Knicks winning. No conflicting information or future dates are involved here, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Knicks defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 110-93 in their NBA game on March 30, 2025. The Knicks, led by OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges (each scoring 28 points), overcame a 14-point deficit by dominating the second half, outscoring the Blazers 60-35 after halftime[1][2][6][13]. The game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the search results.  \n\n**Resolution**: The outcome aligns with the ancillary data's condition for a Knicks victory.  \nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the outcome of the NBA game between the Portland Trail Blazers and the New York Knicks, which took place on March 30, 2025. The AI confirms that the Knicks won the game with a score of 110-93, based on multiple reliable sources including CBS Sports and SI.com, as well as YouTube highlights and a game recap. This outcome aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Knicks victory corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response is logically sound and thorough in its verification process. It checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the game has occurred. It then proceeds to gather evidence from multiple sources to ensure the accuracy of the game's result, noting that there were no indications of postponement or cancellation. This thorough verification process supports the resolution recommendation of p1, which is the correct outcome based on the Knicks winning the game.\n\nThere are no missing information, bias, or errors detected in the response. The AI strictly adheres to the instructions to report based on verified facts and does not speculate or predict outcomes. It also correctly identifies that the event has already occurred and provides a resolution based on the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the NBA game according to the user prompt and ancillary data, with thorough sourcing and logical reasoning.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome and adhered strictly to the resolution conditions provided, leading to an accurate and reliable resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411761 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:02:41 UTC"
