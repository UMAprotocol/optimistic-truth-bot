The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Montreal Canadiens vs. Carolina Hurricanes game on March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if the Canadiens win, it's p2; if the Hurricanes win, p1; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, which is March 29, 2025, 1:44 AM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 28, so it's already happened. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Source [9] from ESPN provides a live score update showing the final score as Hurricanes 4, Canadiens 1. The detailed box score in [9] lists the goals by period, confirming Carolina's victory. Additionally, source [12] on ESPN's game summary also notes the Hurricanes' 4-1 win. \n\nOther sources like [3] and [6] had predictions favoring the Hurricanes, but the actual result is confirmed in the post-game reports. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the result stands. \n\nSince the Hurricanes won, according to the ancillary data, the resolution should be p1. All checks for event occurrence and correct outcome are satisfied with reliable sources.\n</think>\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens faced the Carolina Hurricanes on March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. According to verified game results from ESPN[9][12], the **Carolina Hurricanes defeated the Montreal Canadiens 4-1**. Key details include:\n\n- **First Period**: Josh Anderson scored for Montreal at 0:23, but Carolina's Jackson Blake tied the game at 0:41[9].\n- **Second Period**: Taylor Hall (power play) and Sebastian Aho extended Carolina's lead to 3-1[9].\n- **Third Period**: Andrei Svechnikov sealed the win with an empty-net goal[9].\n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, and the outcome is definitively recorded. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Hurricanes\"** (p1). \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743212605 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 01:43:25 UTC"
