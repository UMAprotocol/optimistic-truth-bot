The ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Alabama advances, \"No\" if they're eliminated, and \"No\" if not determined by May 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Alabama's outcome in the Elite Eight. The search results [1], [2], [5], and [6] all mention Duke defeating Alabama in the Elite Eight game on March 29, 2025. Specifically, result [1] states Duke beat Alabama 85-65, advancing to the Final Four. Result [2] confirms Duke's victory and Alabama's elimination. \n\nLooking at the dates, all the relevant articles are from March 30 or 31, 2025, which is after the game date. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, so the event has already occurred. Since Alabama lost to Duke in the Elite Eight, they were eliminated and couldn't advance to the Final Four. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the team is eliminated, the market resolves to \"No\" (p1). All sources agree Alabama lost, so the answer should be \"No\". There's no conflicting information, so p3 isn't applicable. The Final Four was determined before May 31, so the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nDuke defeated Alabama 85-65 in the Elite Eight on March 29, 2025, eliminating the Crimson Tide from the 2025 NCAA Tournament[1][2][5]. Since Alabama failed to advance past the Elite Eight, they did not qualify for the Final Four. The 2025 Final Four participants are all No. 1 seeds: Duke, Florida, Houston, and Auburn[3][6][8]. \n\nThis outcome was confirmed by multiple official sources including Duke Athletics[1], ESPN[2], CBS Sports[5], and Bleacher Report[6], all reporting Alabama's elimination in the East Region Final. The NCAA tournament bracket shows Alabama's last game occurred on March 29[7], with no subsequent games scheduled.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that Alabama was defeated by Duke in the Elite Eight of the 2025 NCAA Tournament, which is a fact that aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution. The response uses multiple sources to confirm this outcome, which enhances the reliability of the information provided.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It correctly concludes that since Alabama did not advance to the Final Four, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The reasoning is clear, follows the prompt's instructions, and addresses all necessary aspects of the query.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence (Alabama's defeat in the Elite Eight) using multiple reliable sources, including Duke Athletics and major sports news outlets. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) is directly aligned with the verified facts and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI has not omitted any crucial information that would affect the resolution of the query. The response strictly adheres to the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410747 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:45:47 UTC"
