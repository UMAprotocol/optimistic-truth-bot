The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the New York Islanders and the Carolina Hurricanes on March 30, 2025, at 5:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hurricanes win, it's p1 (Hurricanes), if the Islanders win, p2 (Islanders), and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [8]) report that the Carolina Hurricanes defeated the New York Islanders with a score of 6-4. For example, ESPN's recap [1] states the Hurricanes won 6-4, and the NHL's official site [4] confirms the same result. Additionally, the Islanders' own coverage [5] acknowledges the loss, extending their winless streak. \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game took place on March 30. There's no mention of any cancellation or postponement. Therefore, based on the resolution conditions, since the Hurricanes won, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the New York Islanders and Carolina Hurricanes on March 30, 2025, resulted in a **6-4 victory for the Carolina Hurricanes**[1][2][3][4][5]. Multiple sources confirm the Hurricanes secured their 45th win of the season, with Seth Jarvis scoring two goals and Sebastian Aho contributing a goal and two assists[1][3][4]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as it concluded as scheduled[1][4][5]. \n\nGiven the resolution conditions (p1 for Hurricanes win, p2 for Islanders win, p3 for cancellation), the outcome definitively aligns with **p1** based on Carolina's victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
