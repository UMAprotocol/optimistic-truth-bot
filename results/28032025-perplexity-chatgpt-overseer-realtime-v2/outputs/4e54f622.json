The user is asking about a UMA optimistic oracle resolution for an IPL match between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) that was scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if CSK wins, the market resolves to \"Chennai\" (p2), if RCB wins, it's \"Bangalore\" (p1), and if the game isn't completed by April 3, 2025, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the match date. So the event has already occurred. The next step is to determine the outcome of the match using the search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]) report that RCB defeated CSK by 50 runs on March 28, 2025. For example, source [1] states, \"Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) scripted a historic 50-run victory over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in Match 8 of TATA IPL 2025.\" Similarly, source [4] mentions, \"Royal Challengers Bengaluru breached fortress Chepauk to make it two in two in the Indian Premier League 2025.\" \n\nAll the sources confirm that the match was completed, so there's no need to consider the April 3 deadline. The resolution conditions state that an RCB win corresponds to \"Bangalore\" (p1). Therefore, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in question is the same as reported. The match date and teams align with the user's query. There's no mention of the match being postponed or canceled, and all sources indicate it was played as scheduled. \n\nNo conflicting information is present in the search results. All sources consistently report RCB's victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) defeated Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 50 runs in their IPL 2025 match played on March 28, 2025, at MA Chidambaram Stadium[1][3][4][5][6][7]. This marked RCB's first victory over CSK at Chepauk since the inaugural 2008 season[1][4][6], with standout performances from captain Rajat Patidar (51 off 32 balls) and Josh Hazlewood (3/21)[1][4][5].\n\nThe match was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][3][4][5][6][7]. All sources confirm the game concluded on March 28, well before the April 3 resolution deadline specified in the ancillary data[1][3][4][5][6][7].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (IPL match between Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore on March 28, 2025) and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The response uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the match, which is that Royal Challengers Bangalore won by 50 runs. This outcome aligns with the resolution condition that if RCB wins, the market resolves to \"Bangalore\" (p1).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It correctly concludes that since the match was completed and RCB won, the market should resolve to p1. The response also correctly notes that the match was not postponed or canceled, which is relevant to the resolution conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and confirms the outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is based on verified facts and is consistent with the resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and confirms the match's completion within the specified timeframe.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409142 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:19:02 UTC"
