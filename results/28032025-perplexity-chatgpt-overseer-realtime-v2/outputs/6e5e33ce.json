        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Sharks vs. Kings game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1; Sharks win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 31, 2025, which is after the game's scheduled date of March 30. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [4], [6], [7]) report that the Kings won the game 8-1. For example, source [1] states, \"Kings rout Sharks 8-1 to set franchise record for home wins in a season with 27.\" Similarly, source [4] and [6] confirm the same score. \n\nThe ancillary data says a Kings win resolves to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports indicate the game was played as scheduled with a clear result. Therefore, the resolution should be p1. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in the sources matches the user's query. The date, teams, and outcome all align. No conflicting information is present. The Kings' victory is well-documented across multiple reliable sources like CBS Sports and ESPN. \n\nNo other factors like postponement or cancellation are mentioned, so the only possible resolution is p1. The answer is straightforward based on the evidence.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings defeated the San Jose Sharks 8-1 in their NHL game on March 30, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][4][6][7]. The Kings secured their franchise-record 27th home win of the season, with Adrian Kempe and Warren Foegele each scoring two goals. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, and the final outcome was decisively in favor of Los Angeles. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Sharks vs. Kings game) occurred on March 30, 2025, and the current date is March 31, 2025, which means the event is in the past. The response then verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources, which all confirm that the Kings won the game 8-1. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Kings win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It checks that there were no reports of postponement or cancellation, which matches the conditions specified for resolution. The response also ensures that the details of the event (teams involved and the score) match the user prompt, thus avoiding any resolution based on a similar but different event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources and ensures that these sources are reliable (e.g., CBS Sports, ESPN). The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven this analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the system prompt. It accurately resolves the query based on verified facts and aligns with the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and adheres strictly to the instructions, verifying the event's outcome through multiple sources and ensuring alignment with the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\"\n}\n```",

This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412557 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:15:57 UTC"
