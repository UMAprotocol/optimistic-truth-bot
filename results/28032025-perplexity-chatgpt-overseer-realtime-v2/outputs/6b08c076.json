The user wants to know if Auburn made the 2025 Final Four, based on the provided search results and ancillary data. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The given current date is March 30, 2025, which is the same day as some of the search results. The Final Four is scheduled for April 5, 2025, according to source [1]. But wait, the user's current timestamp is March 30, 2025, 11:34 PM UTC. The Elite Eight game between Auburn and Michigan State happened on March 30, as per sources [2] and [3]. \n\nLooking at source [3], it clearly states that Auburn defeated Michigan State 70-64 on March 30, 2025, advancing to the Final Four. Source [2] also mentions that Auburn became the fourth top-seed to advance to the Final Four after beating Michigan State. Additionally, source [6] talks about Auburn preparing for the Elite Eight game against Michigan State, and source [7] outlines the schedule, showing that the winner of Auburn vs. Michigan State would face Florida in the Final Four on April 5. \n\nSince the current date is March 30, and the game result is already reported in the search results, Auburn has indeed advanced. The resolution conditions state that if the team is eliminated, it resolves to \"No\" (p1), otherwise \"Yes\" (p2). Since Auburn won their Elite Eight game, they are in the Final Four. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nAuburn has advanced to the 2025 NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four after defeating Michigan State 70-64 in the Elite Eight on March 30, 2025[3][6]. This marks the program's second Final Four appearance in history, matching their 2019 achievement[3][5]. The Tigers secured their spot as the No. 1 overall seed with a 31-win season, setting a new program record[6].\n\nKey details supporting this resolution:\n- **Game outcome**: Auburn's victory over No. 2 seed Michigan State was decisive, featuring a 17-0 first-half run and strong performance from national player of the year candidate Johni Broome (25 points, 14 rebounds)[3]\n- **Tournament context**: The 2025 Final Four features all four No. 1 seeds for only the second time since 1985, with Auburn set to face SEC rival Florida in the national semifinals[2][7]\n- **Schedule verification**: The Final Four is scheduled for April 5, 2025 at San Antonio's Alamodome, with Auburn's advancement confirmed before the resolution deadline of May 31, 2025[1][7]\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743377646 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-30 23:34:06 UTC"
