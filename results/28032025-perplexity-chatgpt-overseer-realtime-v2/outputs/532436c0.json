The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Mederos vs. Hubbard fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Mederos wins, it's p2; Hubbard, p1; and if there's a draw or unresolved by April 29, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The event happened two days ago, so the fight's result should be available. Let's look through the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] from cagesidepress.com states the official result: MarQuel Mederos def. Austin Hubbard by split decision (28-29, 29-28, 29-28). That's a clear win for Mederos. \n\nResult [3] from mmadecisions.com also confirms the split decision in favor of Mederos, with two judges scoring 29-28 for him and one for Hubbard. \n\nResult [4] from ufc.com's prelim results mentions the same split decision victory for Mederos. \n\nResult [6] from f4wonline.com provides a detailed round-by-round breakdown and the official result again confirming Mederos' win. \n\nOther sources like [5] and [8] discuss predictions and Mederos' intentions but don't affect the outcome since the fight already occurred. \n\nAll credible sources agree Mederos won via split decision. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. Since the event date is in the past and the result is verified by multiple sources, including the official UFC site, the resolution should be p2 (Mederos). No conflicting information found, so no need for p3.\n</think>\n\nMarQuel Mederos defeated Austin Hubbard by split decision (28-29, 29-28, 29-28) in their lightweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025[1][3][4][6]. The fight opened UFC Mexico City's preliminary card at Arena CDMX, with Mederos securing his second UFC victory and eighth consecutive professional win[1][4]. Judges' scorecards showed two officials scoring the bout 29-28 for Mederos, while one judge favored Hubbard 29-28[3][6].\n\nKey moments included:\n- Mederos' effective leg kicks and striking accuracy (45%) versus Hubbard's wrestling attempts[2][7]\n- A dominant second round where Hubbard controlled Mederos' back for extended periods[1]\n- A final round scramble that saw Mederos land damaging elbows from top position[6]\n\nThe result aligns with pre-fight predictions favoring Mederos' momentum and striking capabilities[5][8]. No reports indicate the bout was postponed, canceled, or declared a draw[1][4][6].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
