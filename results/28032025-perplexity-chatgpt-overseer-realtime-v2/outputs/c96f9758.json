        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said \"Fort Knox\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if it's uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The main sources here are the transcripts from the interview. Let's look through the search results that include the interview content. \n\nSearch result [3] is a transcript from the Fox News interview. In the transcript, there's a part where they mention Fort Knox. Specifically, the user says: \"Fort Knox Mystery: Trump and Musk question if America\u2019s $425 Billion in gold is really there.\" But wait, that's a segment title, not part of Musk's dialogue. Let me check the actual conversation.\n\nLooking deeper into [3], there's a line where someone says, \"Fort Knox Mystery: Trump and Musk question if America\u2019s $425 Billion in gold is really there.\" However, this might be a description from the video, not Musk's words. Let me check another source. \n\nSearch result [12] discusses the interview and mentions Musk's team's findings but doesn't explicitly state that Musk said \"Fort Knox.\" However, search result [9] from Axios quotes Musk talking about the revolution in government but doesn't mention Fort Knox. \n\nWait, search result [3] includes a part of the interview transcript where Musk and the team discuss government efficiency and audits. One of the team members, possibly Tyler Hassen, mentions reviewing contracts and finding issues, but there's no direct mention of \"Fort Knox\" in the quoted parts. \n\nLooking at search result [15], which is the specific query's ancillary data, the resolution depends on whether Musk said \"Fort Knox\" during the interview. The key here is to find a direct quote from Musk in the interview. \n\nSearch result [13] is a press release about the interview but doesn't provide the content. Search result [12] from The Bull Elephant mentions the interview and corruption but again, no direct quote of \"Fort Knox\" by Musk. \n\nWait, in search result [3], during the interview, there's a segment where they discuss auditing government spending. The user in the transcript says, \"Fort Knox Mystery: Trump and Musk question if America\u2019s $425 Billion in gold is really there.\" But this might be a title or a chyron, not Musk's actual words. \n\nAnother angle: search result [10] and [11] discuss Musk's interest in auditing Fort Knox's gold reserves, but those are from February 2025, before the March 27 interview. The user's query is specifically about the March 27 interview. \n\nIn search result [3], the full transcript includes a part where the host says, \"as you see there we were just listening into that segment that aired a bit earlier today on Fox News it was an exclusive with Bret Bearer being able to sit down with members of the Doge team of course including there Elon Musk.\" But in the quoted dialogue, Musk doesn't mention \"Fort Knox.\" The team members discuss contracts and audits but not specifically Fort Knox. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no direct evidence that Elon Musk said \"Fort Knox\" during the Bret Baier interview on March 27, 2025. The mentions of Fort Knox in other contexts (like previous events or other interviews) don't apply here. Since the resolution source is the audio/video of the specific interview, and the transcripts provided don't show Musk using the term, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's ancillary data says p2 is Yes and p1 is No. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes. So if Musk didn't say it, it's p1. \n\nBut wait, in search result [3], the transcript includes a part where the host mentions Fort Knox, but that's the host, not Musk. The actual dialogue from Musk in the interview doesn't include \"Fort Knox.\" Therefore, the answer should be p1: No. But I need to be absolutely sure. Let me check all results again. \n\nSearch result [14] is a video titled \"Trump on Missing Gold Reserves At Fort Knox; Elon...\" but that's from February 25, before the interview in question. \n\nGiven all the search results, there's no indication that Musk said \"Fort Knox\" during the March 27 interview. Therefore, the resolution should be p1: No.\n</think>\n\nElon Musk did not say \"Fort Knox\" during his March 27, 2025, interview with Bret Baier on Fox News' *Special Report*. The interview focused on the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to audit federal spending, streamline bureaucracy, and reduce deficits[1][3][9]. While Musk and the DOGE team discussed topics like government waste, contract reviews, and transparency, there is no evidence in the available transcripts or summaries that Musk explicitly mentioned \"Fort Knox\" during the conversation[3][9][12]. \n\nThe term \"Fort Knox\" appears in unrelated segments of Fox News coverage (e.g., discussions about gold reserves in February 2025)[10][11][14], but these predate the March 27 interview and are not part of Musk\u2019s remarks during the Baier interview. The resolution conditions specify that only usage of the term *during this interview* counts, and no such instance occurred[15]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres well to the instructions provided in the user prompt. It correctly identifies that the resolution of the query hinges on whether Elon Musk specifically mentioned \"Fort Knox\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The response thoroughly investigates multiple sources, focusing on the content of the interview and ensuring that any mentions of \"Fort Knox\" are in the context of Musk's own words during this specific event.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a logical approach by methodically checking through various sources, including transcripts and press releases, to confirm whether Musk mentioned \"Fort Knox.\" It correctly concludes that mentions of \"Fort Knox\" in other contexts or from other dates are irrelevant to the resolution of this market. The response is comprehensive in its search and analysis of the available data.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the interview took place as scheduled and scrutinizes the content relevant to the query. It aligns well with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, concluding that since Musk did not mention \"Fort Knox,\" the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The AI has not missed any crucial information based on the details provided in the user prompt and the ancillary data. It has correctly focused on the specific event and used the appropriate sources for verification.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed with the recommendation of p1 (No) is justified based on the evidence provided in the response.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the non-occurrence of the specified term 'Fort Knox' by Elon Musk during the interview, adhering to the resolution conditions and user prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and logically structured, effectively using the provided sources to confirm the resolution. No further improvements are needed.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411607 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:00:07 UTC",
