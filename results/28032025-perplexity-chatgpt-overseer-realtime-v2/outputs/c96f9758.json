        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said \"Fort Knox\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of \"Fort Knox\" in the interview. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles about the interview. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [6] is a transcript from the USA Today video where Musk discusses deficit reduction and Social Security. No mention of Fort Knox there. Result [9] from Axios mentions Musk calling DOGE's work a revolution but doesn't reference Fort Knox. Result [11] is a Fox News video description, but the transcript isn't provided. \n\nOther results like [4], [5], [12], [13], and [14] discuss Musk and Trump's interest in auditing Fort Knox, but these are from February 2025, before the March 27 interview. The query specifically asks about the March 27 interview. \n\nResult [3] and [10] talk about Dogecoin and Musk's influence but don't mention Fort Knox in the context of the Baier interview. Result [7] mentions \"digital Fort Knox\" in a different context related to Bitcoin, not the actual Fort Knox. \n\nSince none of the search results directly indicate that Musk said \"Fort Knox\" during the March 27 interview, and the resolution conditions require the term to be used in the interview, the answer should be \"No\". However, I need to ensure there's no mention in any other source. The Axios article [9] and the Fox News transcript [1] don't mention it. Without any evidence from the interview itself, the resolution should be p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether Elon Musk said \"Fort Knox\" during his March 27, 2025, interview with Bret Baier on Fox News. Based on available evidence:\n\n- The interview focused primarily on Musk\u2019s work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), deficit reduction efforts, and Social Security reforms[1][6][9]. No transcripts or reports from the interview mention Musk using the term \"Fort Knox.\"\n- While Musk and Trump had previously discussed auditing Fort Knox\u2019s gold reserves in February 2025[4][5][12][14], these discussions occurred weeks before the March 27 interview and are unrelated to the specific content of the Baier interview.\n- The resolution conditions specify that **only** usage of the exact term \"Fort Knox\" (or its possessive/plural forms) during this particular interview counts. Compound words or unrelated contexts (e.g., \"digital Fort Knox\" in Bitcoin discussions[7]) do not qualify.\n\nWithout verifiable evidence from the interview\u2019s audio/video confirming the term\u2019s use, the market resolves to **No**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the user prompt by focusing on whether Elon Musk mentioned \"Fort Knox\" during the specified interview. The response correctly identifies that the term must be used exactly as specified, and it checks various sources to confirm whether the term was mentioned.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by systematically checking through various sources, including transcripts and news articles, to find any mention of \"Fort Knox.\" It correctly concludes that since no sources confirmed the use of the term during the interview, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The response also correctly ignores mentions of \"Fort Knox\" outside the context of the specified interview, adhering to the resolution conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the interview took place as scheduled and checks multiple sources to ensure that the term \"Fort Knox\" was not mentioned. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" aligns with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There is no apparent bias or errors in the response. The response does not mention any missing information, and it appears to have adequately searched available sources to confirm the absence of the term \"Fort Knox\" during the interview.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns with the verified facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately checks multiple sources to confirm that 'Fort Knox' was not mentioned during the interview, adheres to the resolution conditions, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. It provides a thorough and logical analysis based on the evidence available.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743222751 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 04:32:31 UTC",
