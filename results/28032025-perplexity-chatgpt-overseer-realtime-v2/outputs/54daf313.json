The ancillary data specifies that p2 corresponds to Torres winning, p1 to Dober, and p3 to a draw or unresolved outcome. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the fight's result. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. Source [1] from BJPENN.COM states that Manuel Torres defeated Drew Dober via KO in the first round. The article includes tweets from UFC confirming the TKO victory.\n2. Source [2] from MMA Junkie also reports Torres's TKO win at 1:45 of Round 1, mentioning Dober's disagreement with the stoppage but confirming the official result.\n3. Source [3] lists the fight result as a TKO for Torres at 1:45 of Round 1.\n4. Source [5] from Sportskeeda describes Torres's first-round TKO and the subsequent debate over the stoppage, but the official result stands.\n5. Source [6] mentions the co-main event where Torres brutally knocked out Dober.\n6. Source [8] from MMA Junkie's live updates confirms the TKO victory for Torres at 1:45 of Round 1.\n\nAll credible sources consistently report that Manuel Torres won the fight by TKO in the first round. The event took place on March 29, 2025, which is before the current date of March 31, 2025. There's no mention of the fight being postponed, canceled, or resulting in a draw. \n\nSince the resolution conditions state that p2 is for Torres winning, and all verified sources confirm his victory, the market should resolve to p2. Even though there was some controversy over the stoppage, the official result from ESPN and other credible outlets is clear. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nManuel Torres defeated Drew Dober via first-round TKO (strikes) at 1:45 of Round 1 during the co-main event of UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025[1][2][3][8]. The official result was confirmed by multiple credible sources including ESPN-affiliated outlets, with Torres landing a decisive right hand that dropped Dober followed by unanswered hammerfists until referee intervention[1][2][5]. \n\nWhile Dober expressed confusion about the stoppage post-fight[2][5], all official records show the bout concluded as a TKO victory for Torres[1][3][8]. The fight occurred as scheduled on March 29, 2025, with no indications of postponement, cancellation, or unresolved scoring[1][3][6][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation based on the criteria provided:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the outcome of the Manuel Torres vs. Drew Dober fight, confirming Torres's victory via TKO in the first round. The response uses multiple credible sources to verify this outcome, including BJPENN.COM, MMA Junkie, and Sportskeeda, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts. The response adheres to the instruction to use concrete evidence and established facts for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources to conclude that Torres won the fight, which corresponds to the resolution condition p2 (Torres winning). It also checks for any indications of postponement, cancellation, or unresolved scoring, which are absent, thus further supporting the resolution to p2. The reasoning is thorough and considers all necessary aspects to ensure a complete evaluation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled on March 29, 2025, and that the outcome was a TKO victory for Torres. This verification is aligned with the facts provided by multiple sources and correctly leads to the recommendation of p2, as defined in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There is no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response effectively uses the sources mentioned and aligns the outcome with the specified resolution conditions without any deviation or incorrect interpretation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
