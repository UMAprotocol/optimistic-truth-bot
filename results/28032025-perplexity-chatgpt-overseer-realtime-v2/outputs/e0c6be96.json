The ancillary data specifies that if the Hornets win, it's p2; Pelicans win, p1; postponed stays open, and canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 30, so it's already in the past. That means I don't have to worry about future dates. Now, I need to confirm the actual result of the game.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources report the game's outcome. Source [1] mentions the Pelicans defeated the Hornets 98-94. Source [2] shows the final score as 98-94 in favor of the Pelicans. Source [3] also confirms the Pelicans' win with a recap. Source [4] from ESPN has the final score as 98-94 Pelicans. Source [6] (ESPN UK) and [8] (another ESPN recap) both reiterate the same result. \n\nAdditionally, source [5] is a postgame interview with the Pelicans' coach James Borrego discussing the win. The box scores and play-by-play in sources [2] and [4] back up the final score. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game having been played as scheduled with the Pelicans winning. \n\nSince the Pelicans won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information or indications of cancellation or postponement. All sources are consistent, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Charlotte Hornets 98-94 in their March 30, 2025 NBA game, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][4][6]. Key details from the matchup include:\n\n**Game Outcome**  \n- Final score: Pelicans 98, Hornets 94  \n- Decisive play: Jos\u00e9 Alvarado's go-ahead three-point play with 31 seconds remaining[1][6]  \n- Pelicans' balanced scoring: Six players scored double digits, led by Keion Brooks Jr. (17 pts)[1][4]  \n- Hornets' performance: Miles Bridges (20 pts) and Nick Smith Jr. (19 pts) led Charlotte[1][6]  \n\n**Context**  \n- Both teams fielded depleted rosters due to injuries and playoff elimination[3][7]  \n- Pelicans assistant coach James Borrego (former Hornets HC) led the team in Willie Green's absence[1][5]  \n- The result impacted lottery odds for both franchises[3][7]  \n\nNo evidence suggests postponement or cancellation. The game concluded as scheduled with a verified outcome.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410096 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:34:56 UTC"
