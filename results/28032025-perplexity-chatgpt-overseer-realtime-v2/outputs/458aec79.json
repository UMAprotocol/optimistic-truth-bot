The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the NHL game between Utah and the Chicago Blackhawks on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, the resolution is p2; if the Blackhawks win, it's p1; and if the game is canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, so the game on March 30 is indeed in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome of the game using the search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [1] from secondcityhockey.com clearly states that Utah won the game 5-2. The article details the goals scored by each team, including timestamps and assists, which adds credibility. Source [6] from chicagohockeynow.com also confirms the final score of 5-2 in favor of Utah, mentioning that Utah scored four unanswered goals after the Blackhawks briefly led. \n\nOther sources like [2] and [4] are predictions made before the game, giving Utah a higher probability of winning, but they don't affect the resolution since the actual result is already known. Sources [3], [5], [7], and [8] discuss prediction models and market efficiency but aren't relevant to the game's outcome. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and not postponed or canceled, and multiple reliable sources confirm Utah's victory, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no indication of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable here. All conditions are met to resolve to Utah's win.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Utah Hockey Club and Chicago Blackhawks occurred on March 30, 2025, as scheduled. Multiple sources confirm Utah defeated Chicago with a final score of **5-2**[1][6]. The game proceeded without postponement or cancellation, with Utah scoring four unanswered goals after Chicago briefly held a 2-1 lead in the second period[1][6].\n\n**Key game details**:\n- Utah's Nick DeSimone opened scoring at 8:21 of the second period\n- Chicago briefly led 2-1 after goals from Joe Veleno and Ryan Donato\n- Utah regained control with two goals in 31 seconds (Mikhail Sergachev and Alexander Kerfoot)\n- Third-period insurance goals from Kailer Yamamoto and Logan Cooley sealed Utah's victory\n\nAs the game concluded normally and Utah won decisively, this market resolves to **Utah** per the defined resolution conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response is logically structured, beginning with a verification of the event date and proceeding to confirm the outcome through reliable sources. The response correctly identifies that the game occurred on March 30, 2025, and that Utah won with a score of 5-2, leading to a resolution of p2 as per the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\nKey strengths of the response include:\n1. Accurate verification of the event date relative to the current timestamp, confirming that the event is in the past.\n2. Proper use of reliable sources to confirm the outcome of the game, ensuring that the resolution is based on verified facts.\n3. Correct alignment of the resolution recommendation (p2 for a Utah win) with the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n4. Detailed reporting of game specifics, which supports the credibility of the sources and the factual accuracy of the event's outcome.\n\nHowever, there are minor areas for improvement:\n- The response could benefit from explicitly stating that no information was found regarding postponement or cancellation, which would reinforce the decision to resolve based on the game's outcome rather than defaulting to p3 or p4.\n- While the response is thorough, it could enhance clarity by briefly summarizing why other potential resolutions (p1 or p3) are not applicable based on the event details and outcomes provided.\n\nDespite these minor points, the response is factually accurate, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410484 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:41:24 UTC"
