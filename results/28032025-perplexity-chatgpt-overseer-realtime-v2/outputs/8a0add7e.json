The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Michigan vs. Auburn college basketball game scheduled for March 28 at 12:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Auburn wins, it resolves to p1; if Michigan wins, p2; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was supposed to happen on March 28, so it's already in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the search results, several sources ([1], [9], [10], [11], [14]) mention the game between Auburn and Michigan. Specifically, result [1] states that Auburn beat Michigan 78-65 on March 29, advancing to the Elite Eight. Other sources like [9], [10], and [11] confirm the same score and outcome. Additionally, [14] is a recap from Michigan's perspective, acknowledging their loss to Auburn. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled, with Auburn winning. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Auburn). \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The other search results don't relate to this game's outcome, focusing instead on other topics like electric vehicles or gaming IPOs. All relevant sports results consistently report Auburn's victory. \n\nSince the event occurred, the result is clear, and there's no ambiguity. The correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Auburn and Michigan occurred as scheduled on March 28, 2025, with Auburn defeating Michigan 78-65[1][9][10][11][14]. Multiple sources confirm the game was played without postponement or cancellation, and Auburn's victory advanced them to the Elite Eight[1][5]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions:\n- **Auburn's win** directly triggers **p1** resolution  \n- No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in the search results\n- All game reports confirm completion with a decisive outcome\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the outcome of the Michigan vs. Auburn college basketball game, which is crucial for resolving the UMA optimistic oracle request.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game occurred on March 29, 2025, and not on the scheduled date of March 28, 2025. It accurately reports Auburn's victory over Michigan with a score of 78-65, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition for an Auburn win (p1). The response also confirms that the game was neither postponed nor canceled, which matches the conditions outlined for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date of the event, followed by confirming the outcome through multiple sources. It ensures that there is no conflicting information and that all relevant sources agree on the outcome. This thorough verification process supports the final recommendation confidently.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple reliable sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and accurate. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 (Auburn) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the relevant event and does not include unnecessary information that could confuse the resolution process.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Michigan vs. Auburn game, aligns with the resolution conditions, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and provides a clear, well-reasoned recommendation based on the facts.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409910 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:31:50 UTC"
