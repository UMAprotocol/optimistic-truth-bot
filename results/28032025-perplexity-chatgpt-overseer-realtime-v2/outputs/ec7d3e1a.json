The ancillary data specifies that if the Blue Jackets win, it's p1; if the Canucks win, p2; and other conditions for p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine who won the game. Looking through the sources, multiple articles (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12) report that the Blue Jackets won 7-6 in a shootout. The game was on March 28, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 29, 2025. \n\nThe key points from the sources: Columbus trailed 3-0 but came back, tied the game, and eventually won in a shootout with Kent Johnson scoring the lone shootout goal. Elvis Merzlikins made crucial saves in the shootout. The final result was a Blue Jackets victory. \n\nSince the game was completed and not postponed or canceled, and the Blue Jackets won, the resolution should be p1. All sources confirm the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The market should resolve to \"Blue Jackets,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks and Columbus Blue Jackets played their scheduled NHL game on March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The Columbus Blue Jackets won the game 7-6 in a shootout[1][2][3][5][6][8][9][12]. Despite trailing 3-0 in the first period and 5-3 in the third period, the Blue Jackets rallied both times, with Boone Jenner scoring two goals and Kent Johnson netting the decisive shootout goal[1][3][5][12]. Elvis Merzlikins made 31 saves and stopped all three shootout attempts[1][13], securing the victory.\n\n**Key Game Details**  \n- **Final Score**: Blue Jackets 7, Canucks 6 (SO)  \n- **Shootout Result**: Kent Johnson scored the lone goal, while Merzlikins denied all three Vancouver attempts[1][5][13].  \n- **Standings Impact**: The win moved Columbus into a tie for the final Eastern Conference wild-card spot[1][3][8].  \n\n**Resolution Conditions Met**  \n- The game was completed as scheduled, with no postponement or cancellation.  \n- The Blue Jackets\u2019 victory triggers a resolution to \"Blue Jackets\" (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743238677 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 08:57:57 UTC"
