        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said the word \"Billion\" 10 or more times during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The resolution depends on the actual count from the interview's audio/video. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any transcripts or mentions of Musk's usage of \"Billion.\" Looking at the provided sources, several mention parts of the interview. \n\nSearch result [5] includes a transcript snippet where Musk says, \"our goal is to reduce the waste and fraud by $4 billion a day every day seven days a week.\" That's one instance. \n\nResult [10] has a more detailed transcript. Musk mentions \"a billion dollars\" twice in the context of wasteful spending, like the survey example. He also talks about \"$4 billion a day,\" which adds another instance. \n\nResult [9] quotes Musk saying \"reduce the waste and fraud by $4 billion a day,\" which matches the transcript in [10]. \n\nResult [14] mentions Musk's claim of saving \"$130 billion\" and aiming for \"$4 billion per day.\" \n\nResult [15] is a transcript from a different interview, so it's not relevant here. \n\nResult [11] states Musk's goal to \"cut the deficit by a trillion dollars\" but doesn't mention \"billion\" in the provided text. \n\nPutting this together, in the available transcripts from the March 27 interview, Musk uses \"billion\" at least three times. However, the search results don't provide the full interview transcript. Without the complete audio/video, it's unclear if he reached 10 mentions. The market resolves to \"No\" if the interview wasn't released by March 28, but the sources confirm it aired on March 27. Since the available evidence shows some uses but not 10, and the full transcript isn't provided, the resolution should be based on what's available. The user's ancillary data says if the interview is released and the condition isn't met, resolve to \"No.\" Since the interview was released but the provided excerpts don't reach 10, the answer is \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nElon Musk used the term \"billion\" multiple times during his March 27, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News' *Special Report*. Key instances include:\n\n- **Budget reduction targets**: Musk stated their goal to \"reduce the waste and fraud by $4 billion a day\" [5][9][10], repeating this figure multiple times in the interview.\n- **Waste examples**: He cited a federal survey contract costing \"almost a billion dollars\" compared to a $10,000 commercial alternative [10].\n- **Progress claims**: Musk asserted DOGE had already saved \"$130 billion\" through cost-cutting measures [14], though analysts noted this fell short of their $4B/day target [14].\n\nWhile the term \"billion\" appears in multiple contexts (including plural/possessive forms like \"billions\"), available transcripts and video clips show fewer than 10 clear instances of the exact term being spoken by Musk. The full 50-minute interview aired as scheduled on March 27 [3][4], meeting the release requirement, but available evidence from verified sources doesn't demonstrate 10+ utterances of \"billion.\"\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event in question (Elon Musk's interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025) and adheres to the user prompt's requirement to count the instances of the word \"billion\" mentioned by Elon Musk. The response correctly identifies several instances from different parts of the interview, ensuring that the term's usage aligns with the user prompt's conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by correlating the instances of the word \"billion\" found in various sources with the requirement to determine if the word was mentioned 10 or more times. The AI's decision to recommend resolution to \"No\" (p1) is based on the evidence provided by the excerpts, which show fewer than 10 mentions. This reasoning is sound given the data available.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the interview occurred as scheduled and checks multiple sources for mentions of the word \"billion.\" The recommendation aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which states the market should resolve to \"No\" if the full interview does not demonstrate 10+ mentions of \"billion.\"\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit noticeable bias or errors. It appropriately uses the sources mentioned to compile evidence of the word's usage. However, it notes the absence of a complete transcript or full video, which could potentially contain more instances of the word \"billion.\" This limitation is acknowledged, and the decision is made based on the best available evidence, which is a prudent approach.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It accurately assesses the information available, adheres to the user prompt's requirements, and logically concludes based on the evidence provided. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) is justified given the data reviewed.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the event, adheres to the prompt's requirements, and logically uses available evidence to make a recommendation. The decision to resolve as 'No' aligns with the evidence provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the sources to compile instances of the word 'billion' and makes a reasoned decision based on this evidence. It acknowledges the absence of a complete transcript, which is a limitation but handles it appropriately by basing the decision on available data.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743223576 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 04:46:16 UTC",
