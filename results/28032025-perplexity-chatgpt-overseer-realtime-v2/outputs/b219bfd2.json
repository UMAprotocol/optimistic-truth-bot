The ancillary data specifies that p1 is for the Nationals, p2 for the Phillies, and p3 for a 50-50 split if the game is postponed, canceled, or tied. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 30, 2025. Sources [1], [3], [5], and [6] all confirm the game was played. So, no postponement or cancellation here.\n\nNext, determine the official winner. The ESPN recap [6] states the Nationals won 5-1. The box score from Fox Sports [3] and the game summary [5] also show the Nationals leading 5-1. The YouTube highlights [1] describe the Nationals' key plays, including home runs by Josh Bell and Nathaniel Lowe, supporting the win. \n\nThe resolution conditions require using MLB's official outcome. All sources align that the Nationals were the victors. There's no mention of the game being suspended or ending in a tie. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1, corresponding to the Nationals' win.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Nationals defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1 on March 30, 2025, in a game that concluded without postponement or suspension[1][3][5][6]. Key contributions came from Josh Bell's three-run homer and Nathaniel Lowe's two-run shot, while Mitchell Parker delivered 6.1 scoreless innings for Washington[6].

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It confirms that the game occurred as scheduled and identifies the winner based on multiple reliable sources, including ESPN and Fox Sports. The response correctly applies the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt, determining that the Nationals' victory aligns with the ancillary data (p1 corresponds to a Nationals win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the sequence of checks required by the prompt: verifying the game's occurrence, confirming no postponement or cancellation, and establishing the winner based on the official MLB outcome. The response is complete as it covers all potential scenarios mentioned in the prompt (postponement, cancellation, suspension, official result, and tie).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Nationals win) with the verified facts. The details provided about the game's score and key players contribute to the credibility and specificity of the verification.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\nGiven the thoroughness, accuracy, and strict adherence to the resolution conditions and system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and reliable for resolving the oracle request.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the oracle request based on the event's verified outcome and adheres to all specified conditions and instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple reliable sources to verify the event's outcome and logically applies the resolution conditions without any errors or bias.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
