The ancillary data specifies that if the Jets win, it's p1; Canucks win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 30, so it's already in the past. Now, I need to verify the result of that game using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, multiple articles confirm the outcome. Source [1] states the Jets won 3-1. Sources [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], and [8] all corroborate this result. The ESPN score in [7] explicitly shows Jets 3, Canucks 1. The YouTube highlights in [8] also mention the Jets' victory. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and not postponed or canceled, the resolution depends on the winner. All sources agree the Jets won, so the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being delayed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The other sources, like [4], reference a previous game in January where the Jets won 6-1, but that's irrelevant here. The March 30 game is clearly covered in the recent sources. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p1 (Jets).\n</think>\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets defeated the Vancouver Canucks 3-1 in their March 30, 2025, NHL game at Canada Life Centre[1][2][3][5][6][7]. Key details from the matchup include:\n\n- **Kyle Connor** scored his team-leading 38th goal and added an assist[1][5]\n- **Connor Hellebuyck** made 23 saves for his 50th win of the season[3][7]\n- The Jets extended their Western Conference lead to 6 points over Dallas[1][5]\n- Vancouver's playoff hopes diminished as they fell 6 points behind wild card spots[2][12]\n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, meeting all specified resolution conditions.

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and verification of event alignment with the facts provided in the user prompt. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Canucks vs. Jets game occurred on March 30, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. It correctly states that the Winnipeg Jets won the game 3-1 against the Vancouver Canucks. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Jets win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly disregards irrelevant information about a previous game and focuses solely on the event in question. The response also provides additional context about the game, such as individual performances and implications for the standings, which, while not necessary for the resolution, enriches the understanding of the event's significance.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, ensuring that the recommendation is based on verified facts. The alignment with the ancillary data in the user prompt is precise, as the Jets' victory directly leads to the recommendation of p1.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The information provided is relevant and directly pertains to the user prompt's requirements. All necessary aspects of the event that influence the market resolution are covered, and there is no missing information that would affect the outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Canucks vs. Jets game, aligns with the resolution conditions, and provides a well-reasoned recommendation based on verified sources.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome and disregards irrelevant information, focusing strictly on the event specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411220 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:53:40 UTC"
