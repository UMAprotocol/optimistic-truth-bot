        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Miami Marlins game on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Marlins, p2 is Pirates, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 28. The current date is March 29, 2025, so the game date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources mention the game on March 28. For example, source [1] talks about the Marlins' walk-off victory on Opening Day, which was March 28. Source [5] also describes the Marlins winning 5-4 with a walk-off single in the ninth inning. Similarly, source [10] confirms the Marlins won 5-4 with a walk-off by Kyle Stowers. \n\nI need to verify the official outcome. The key here is that the official result as per MLB rules is what matters. Sources [1], [5], and [10] all state that the Marlins won the game. There's no mention of the game being postponed, suspended, or ending in a tie. The ancillary data says if the game is completed, it resolves to the official winner. Since the Marlins won, the resolution should be p1. \n\nI should also check if any sources contradict this. Source [9] mentions a Pirates 6-5 win over Marlins, but the date there is March 28, 2024, which is a different year. That's likely a typo or an error, as other sources from 2025 clearly state the Marlins won on March 28, 2025. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 (Marlins).\n</think>\n\nThe Miami Marlins defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-4 on March 28, 2025, in a game that featured a dramatic ninth-inning comeback. After trailing 4-1 entering the bottom of the seventh, the Marlins scored two runs in the eighth and completed the rally with Nick Fortes' leadoff triple and Kyle Stowers' walk-off single against Pirates closer David Bednar in the ninth[1][5][10]. \n\nThe game was played to completion with no suspensions or postponements, and Major League Baseball officially recorded the Marlins as the winners[1][5][10]. No evidence suggests the game ended in a tie or required continuation beyond March 28.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The details provided about the game's progression and final score are consistent with the user prompt's requirement to use the official outcome as recorded by Major League Baseball. The response does not predict future outcomes but rather reports on an event that has already occurred, which is in line with the system prompt's instructions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date of the event, checking multiple sources for the game's outcome, and confirming that the game was not postponed, suspended, or ended in a tie. The response also correctly dismisses an irrelevant source that refers to a game from a previous year, demonstrating attention to detail and critical evaluation of sources.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring reliability. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Marlins win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions outlined in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743212680 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 01:44:40 UTC",
