        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about the resolution of a market on the UFC Fight Night bout between Rafa Garc\u00eda and Vinc Pichel. The ancillary data specifies that if Garc\u00eda wins, it resolves to p2, Pichel to p1, and a draw or other issues to p3 (50-50). The event date is March 29, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome of the Garc\u00eda vs. Pichel fight. Let's look through the sources provided.\n\nSearch result [1] discusses the main event between Moreno and Erceg but doesn't mention Garc\u00eda vs. Pichel. \n\nResult [2] from mmadecisions.com has detailed information about the Garc\u00eda vs. Pichel fight. It states that Rafa Garc\u00eda defeated Vinc Pichel by unanimous decision. The judges' scores are listed as 30-27, 30-27, and 29-28 in favor of Garc\u00eda. Additionally, media scores and fan scoring predominantly favor Garc\u00eda. This seems like a reliable source.\n\nResult [3] (Wikipedia) lists the fight under the preliminary card with Garc\u00eda winning by unanimous decision (30\u201327, 30\u201327, 29\u201328), which matches the details from [2].\n\nResult [4] from ESPN Africa's live coverage doesn't mention this specific fight in the snippets provided, but result [7] from RingSide24 confirms Garc\u00eda's victory by unanimous decision with the same scores. \n\nResult [6] (Sherdog) has a play-by-play but the specific rounds for Garc\u00eda vs. Pichel aren't detailed in the provided snippet. However, result [7] and [2] are consistent in their reporting.\n\nSince all the relevant sources ([2], [3], [7]) confirm that Rafa Garc\u00eda won the fight by unanimous decision, the market should resolve to p2 as per the resolution conditions. The event took place on March 29, 2025, which is before the current date, so there's no issue with it being a future event. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2 (Garc\u00eda).\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between Rafa Garc\u00eda and Vinc Pichel took place on March 29, 2025, as part of the UFC on ESPN 64 event in Mexico City. According to multiple verified sources, **Rafa Garc\u00eda** won the fight by **unanimous decision** with judges' scores of 30-27, 30-27, and 29-28[2][3][7]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided, where a Garc\u00eda victory corresponds to **p2**. The event occurred before the cutoff date, and no credible reports indicate a draw, postponement, or cancellation. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event in question, the UFC Fight Night bout between Rafa Garc\u00eda and Vinc Pichel, and correctly notes the date of the event as March 29, 2025. The response checks multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the fight, which is a key requirement of the system prompt. The sources cited (mmadecisions.com, Wikipedia, and RingSide24) are used to verify that Rafa Garc\u00eda won by unanimous decision, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the outcome of the fight from multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. It correctly ignores irrelevant information (such as details from other fights or events) and focuses solely on the Garc\u00eda vs. Pichel fight. The response also correctly notes that there is no information suggesting a draw, postponement, or cancellation, which would affect the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through credible sources and aligns the recommendation (p2 for a Garc\u00eda win) directly with the facts verified and the conditions outlined in the user prompt. This ensures that the recommendation is based on concrete evidence as required.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response does not speculate and sticks to verified information, which is crucial for the integrity of the resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It adheres strictly to the instructions provided, uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome, and aligns the recommendation correctly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using credible sources and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event outcome and provides a clear, well-reasoned recommendation based on the facts.\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409173 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:19:33 UTC",
