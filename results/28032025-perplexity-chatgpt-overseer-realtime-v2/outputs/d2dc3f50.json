The ancillary data specifies that if the Oilers win, it's p1; Flames win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the date. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game happened two days ago. The next step is to look at the search results to determine the outcome. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles (1, 2, 3, 6, 8) report that the Oilers won 3-2 in overtime. For example, source [1] mentions Draisaitl scoring the winning goal in OT. Source [2] confirms the final score and that the Oilers moved up in the standings. The other sources also consistently report the Oilers' victory. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. The prediction in source [5] suggested Flames might win, but the actual result was an Oilers victory. \n\nSince the Oilers won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers defeated the Calgary Flames 3-2 in overtime on March 29, 2025, at Rogers Place. Leon Draisaitl scored the game-winning goal 2:25 into overtime, marking his 51st goal of the season and securing the Oilers' victory[1][2][6]. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, and all sources confirm the final outcome[3][8].  \n\n**Key Details:**  \n- Regulation ended 2-2, with Draisaitl tying the game late in the third period[4][8].  \n- The Oilers improved to 42-26-5, tying for second place in the Pacific Division[6].  \n- No evidence of the game being altered or unresolved[1][2][3][6][8].  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1** (Oilers).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the outcome of the NHL game between the Calgary Flames and the Edmonton Oilers, which took place on March 29, 2025, and provides a clear resolution based on the verified facts.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game occurred on March 29, 2025, and that the current date is March 31, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. It confirms the Oilers' victory over the Flames with a score of 3-2 in overtime, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition for an Oilers win (p1). The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring reliability and adherence to the requirement for verification through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly ignores irrelevant predictions and focuses on the actual results of the game. The response also checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which there were none, thus not triggering the other resolution conditions (p3 or remaining open).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome accurately and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the facts established through source verification. This ensures that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the event specified in the user prompt and does not deviate into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, and logical processing of the information, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event, adheres to the resolution conditions, and uses multiple reliable sources for confirmation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively meets all requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412491 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:14:51 UTC"
