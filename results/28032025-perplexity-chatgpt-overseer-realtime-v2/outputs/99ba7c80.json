The ancillary data specifies that p2 is for the Phillies winning, p1 for the Nationals, and p3 if it's a tie or unresolved. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game was set for March 29 at 4:05 PM ET. The current date provided is March 29, 2025, 11:20 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the event date is in the past.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome. Looking at the sources, several mention the game. Source [9] from thescore.com provides a detailed box score showing the Phillies won 11-6. Additionally, source [6] on YouTube highlights the Phillies winning 7-3 in extra innings, but that might be a different game. Wait, checking the dates, source [6] is from March 27, which was the opener, while the March 29 game is a separate one. \n\nSource [9] clearly states the final score as Phillies 11, Nationals 6. Other sources like [11] mention Kyle Schwarber's home run contributing to the Phillies' lead. The betting results in sources [1], [8], and [12] predicted a Phillies win, which aligns with the actual outcome. \n\nSince the game was completed and the official MLB outcome (as per source [9]) has the Phillies winning, the resolution should be p2. There's no indication of postponement or suspension, so no need for p3. All conditions in the ancillary data are met for p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Washington Nationals 11-6 in the MLB game played on March 29, 2025, at Nationals Park[9]. The game concluded without postponement or suspension, and the official outcome recorded by Major League Baseball shows a Phillies victory[9][11]. Key moments included Kyle Schwarber's three-run homer in the 6th inning[11] and Brandon Marsh's three-run shot in the 7th[9], contributing to the Phillies' decisive win.  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **p2** (Phillies win) based on the verified final score and MLB\u2019s official records[9][11].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
