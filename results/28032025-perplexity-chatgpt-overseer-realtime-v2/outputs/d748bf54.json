The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Detroit Tigers and Los Angeles Dodgers on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Dodgers, p2 is Tigers, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 29. The current date given is March 30, 2025, so the game date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 3, 5, 7, 10) report that the Dodgers won the game on March 29 with a score of 8-5 in the 10th inning. Mookie Betts hit a walk-off three-run homer. The game was completed, so there's no suspension or postponement mentioned. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that the official MLB outcome determines the result. Since the Dodgers won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no indication of the game being canceled, postponed, or ending in a tie. All sources confirm the Dodgers' victory, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Tigers vs. Los Angeles Dodgers game scheduled for March 29, 2025, was completed as planned. The **Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Detroit Tigers 8-5 in 10 innings**, with Mookie Betts hitting a walk-off three-run homer[1][3][5][7][10]. The game was not postponed, suspended, or declared a tie, and it concluded according to MLB rules. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided (p1 for Dodgers win, p2 for Tigers win, p3 for unresolved/50-50), the market resolves to **p1** (Dodgers victory) as confirmed by multiple verified sources reporting the official outcome.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
