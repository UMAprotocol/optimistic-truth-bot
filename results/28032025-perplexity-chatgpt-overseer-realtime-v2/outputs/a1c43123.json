The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves based on the official MLB outcome, with p1 for Marlins, p2 for Pirates, and p3 for a tie or unresolved game. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 30. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game is in the past. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Sources [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], and [8] all mention the March 30 game. \n\nNext, I need to determine the official outcome. According to the box score in [5], the Marlins won 3-2. Source [4] from ESPN's recap also states the Marlins won 3-2 with a walk-off wild pitch in the ninth inning. Additionally, [3] mentions the Marlins' third consecutive walk-off win, including the March 30 game. The YouTube highlights in [6] and [7] support this outcome, showing the Marlins' victory. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that the official MLB outcome is used. All sources agree the Marlins won, so the correct resolution is p1. There's no indication the game was postponed, suspended, or tied. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Miami Marlins defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-2 on March 30, 2025, in a game that concluded with a walk-off wild pitch in the bottom of the ninth inning[3][4][5]. This marked the Marlins' third consecutive walk-off victory in their opening series, a historic achievement not seen since the 1901 Milwaukee Brewers[3][4]. \n\nKey moments included:\n- **Andrew McCutchen's 800th career extra-base hit** with a second-inning solo homer[4]\n- **Griffin Conine's game-tying HR** in the seventh inning, coinciding with his father Jeff Conine's induction into the Marlins Hall of Fame[4]\n- **Derek Hill's game-winning sequence**: Walk, stolen base, advancement on an error, and scoring on David Bednar's wild pitch[4][5]\n\nThe game was declared official through nine completed innings with no suspensions or postponements[4][5]. Per MLB rules and the ancillary data specifications, the market resolves to **p1** (Marlins win)[4][5].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
