The ancillary data says if the Rangers win, it's p2; Sharks win is p1; postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the event is in the past. Now, need to verify the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [8], [9]) report the Rangers won 6-1. For example, source [1] states \"Panarin, Fox each score 2 goals as Rangers top Sharks 6-1\" and source [9] mentions the Rangers moved into the playoff wild card spot after the win. The Sharks' only goal was by Cam Lund, his first NHL goal, but the score was 6-1 in favor of the Rangers. \n\nNo sources mention the game being postponed or canceled. All reports confirm the game was played as scheduled. Therefore, the outcome is a Rangers win. According to the resolution conditions, Rangers win corresponds to p2. \n\nNeed to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources align on the result, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Rangers defeated the San Jose Sharks 6-1 in their NHL game played on March 29, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. Multiple sources confirm the Rangers dominated the game, with Artemi Panarin and Adam Fox each scoring two goals[1][2][8][9]. Jonathan Quick made 21 saves for New York, while San Jose's lone goal came from rookie Cam Lund in the third period[4][8]. The result was decisive, with New York leading 2-0 after the first period and extending their advantage throughout the game[9].\n\nThis outcome triggers the resolution condition specified in the ancillary data, where a Rangers victory corresponds to \"p2.\" There is no indication of postponement or cancellation in any of the verified game reports[1][2][4][8][9].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Rangers vs. Sharks game on March 29, 2025) and verifies that it has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. The outcome of the game is reported with specific details, including the score and key players, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts. The response adheres to the instruction to report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt regarding how the market should resolve based on different outcomes (Rangers win, Sharks win, postponement, cancellation). It confirms the Rangers' victory and correctly applies the ancillary data to recommend resolution p2. The reasoning is thorough, checking for any indications of postponement or cancellation and confirming the game's occurrence as scheduled.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The alignment of the recommendation (p2 for a Rangers win) with the facts provided is precise and follows the ancillary data guidelines.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The outcome is clearly stated, sources are checked for consistency, and the resolution condition is correctly applied.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412571 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:16:11 UTC"
