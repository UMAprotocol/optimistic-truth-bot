        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Warriors vs. Spurs game on March 30, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Warriors win, it's p2; if the Spurs win, p1; postponed stays open, canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's March 31, 2025, so the game has already happened. Now, looking at the search results to find the game's outcome. \n\nSearch result [1] from NBC Sports Bay Area states the Warriors won 148-106 against the Spurs on March 30. It mentions key players like Podziemski and Moody contributing to the win. The article also notes the Warriors' strong performance with season-high points. \n\nResult [3] from Fox Sports lists the game date as March 30, 2025, and under \"SPREAD,\" it mentions the Warriors needed to win by 12 points or more, which they did (148-106 is a 42-point difference). \n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports again provides the box score, showing the Warriors' field goal percentage and points, confirming the win. \n\nResult [8] from ESPN explicitly states the final score as Warriors 148-106 Spurs, with Brandin Podziemski scoring 27 points. \n\nOther results like [2] and [4] discuss pre-game decisions and player performances but still align with the Warriors playing and winning. \n\nNo sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. All evidence points to the game occurring as scheduled with a decisive Warriors victory. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Warriors).\n</think>\n\nThe Golden State Warriors defeated the San Antonio Spurs 148-106 on March 30, 2025, in a decisive victory[1][8]. The Warriors set a season-high scoring total with 148 points, led by Brandin Podziemski's 27 points and Moses Moody's 20-point contribution[1][4]. Key factors included:\n\n**Dominant Team Performance**  \n- Shot 57.7% from the field with 42 assists and 17 steals[1][7]  \n- Scored 44 first-quarter points - their highest opening period of the season[1]  \n- All nine players scored in the first quarter[1]  \n\n**Standings Impact**  \n- Improved to 42-31 record, maintaining 7th in the Western Conference[8]  \n- Gained a one-game lead over the Clippers for the 6th seed[1]  \n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1][2][7][8]. As the Warriors won decisively per the final score verification across multiple authoritative sports outlets[1][7][8], the market resolution aligns with the ancillary data's defined outcome for a Warriors victory.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Warriors vs. Spurs game) occurred on March 30, 2025, and that the current date is March 31, 2025, confirming the event is in the past. The AI used multiple reliable sources (NBC Sports Bay Area, Fox Sports, ESPN) to verify the outcome of the game, which is that the Warriors won with a score of 148-106. This outcome aligns perfectly with the user's resolution conditions where a Warriors win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date of the event, followed by a thorough search for the outcome using credible sports news outlets. It confirms the game was not postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions for a standard resolution based on the game's outcome. The AI also provides detailed statistics and information about the game, which supports the credibility of the sources and the final score reported.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation of p2 is based on verified facts that the Warriors won the game. This recommendation is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p2 corresponds to a Warriors win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or significant omissions in the response. The AI strictly adhered to the facts and did not include unnecessary or unrelated information. It focused solely on the event specified in the prompt without deviating to other similar events or general information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to recommend p2 is well-supported by the evidence provided, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verified the event's outcome using reliable sources and aligned the recommendation with the user's specified resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple credible sources to confirm the event's outcome and provided a detailed, factual basis for the resolution recommendation.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411379 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:56:19 UTC"
