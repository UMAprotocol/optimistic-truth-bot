        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price on Binance for the BTCUSDT pair closed above $84,000 on March 28, 2025, specifically at noon ET. The resolution depends on the 1-minute candle close price at that time. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any data around that date and time. Looking through the sources, several mention March 28, 2025. For example, result [3] discusses a market drop on March 28, mentioning BTC's price being pushed below $85,000. Result [12] from Binance's market update on March 28 states BTC was trading at $85,320 at 09:30 AM UTC, which is 5:30 AM ET. Later that day, result [16] notes BTC dropped below $84,000 USDT, trading at 83,983.15 around 15:06 PM UTC (11:06 AM ET). Another update on March 29 (result [18]) shows BTC at 83,919.70 at 02:57 AM UTC (March 28, 10:57 PM ET), still below $84k. \n\nThe critical time is noon ET, which is 16:00 UTC. The closest data points around that time are from result [16] at 15:06 UTC (11:06 AM ET) showing a price below $84k, and result [12] from 09:30 UTC (5:30 AM ET) at $85,320. There's a gap between 11:06 AM ET and the resolution time of noon ET. However, subsequent data on March 29 and 30 (results [17] and [18]) show continued declines, suggesting the price remained below $84k after the drop. \n\nSince the specific 1-minute candle at noon ET isn't directly provided, but multiple sources indicate a downward trend and prices below $84k around that period, it's reasonable to conclude the close price at the specified time was below the threshold. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nBitcoin's price on Binance's BTC/USDT pair fell below $84,000 during key trading windows on March 28, 2025, according to multiple verified data points. The Binance market update at 09:30 UTC (05:30 ET) showed BTC trading at $85,320[12], but by 15:06 UTC (11:06 ET), the price had dropped to $83,983.15[16]. This downward trend continued into subsequent days, with BTC reaching $81,862.57 by March 30[17].\n\nThe resolution criteria specifically requires a **1-minute candle close at or above $84,000.01 at noon ET (16:00 UTC)** on March 28. While no direct timestamped price for this exact minute appears in the sources, the available evidence shows:\n\n1. Sustained bearish momentum throughout March 28[3][12][16]\n2. Multiple confirmations of prices below $84,000 in the hours surrounding the target time[16][18]\n3. Technical analysis indicating strong resistance at $84,816-$85,717 during this period[13]\n\nGiven the documented price action and the absence of contradictory data showing a recovery above $84,000 at the specified time, the most probable outcome aligns with the observed sub-$84,000 trading levels during this window. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions by focusing on the specific event of Bitcoin's price on Binance for the BTCUSDT pair on March 28, 2025, at noon ET. The response uses the specified source (Binance) and correctly identifies the relevant data points around the specified time.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the available data points before and after the specified time, noting a downward trend and prices below $84,000. It correctly infers that since no data point contradicts this trend at the critical time of noon ET, the price likely did not exceed $84,000. This reasoning is sound given the absence of direct evidence to the contrary.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event using the specified source and aligns the recommendation with the observed facts. The recommendation of p1 (No) is based on multiple data points indicating that the price was below $84,000 around the critical time.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not have direct data for the exact minute but uses a logical inference based on available data, which is a reasonable approach given the constraints.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, logically sound, and aligns with the requirements of the user prompt and the system prompt instructions.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409463 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:24:23 UTC",
