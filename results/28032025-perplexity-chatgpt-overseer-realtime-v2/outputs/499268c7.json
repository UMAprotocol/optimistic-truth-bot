The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the New Jersey Devils vs. Winnipeg Jets game scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Jets win, it's p1; if the Devils win, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 28) is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources ([6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14]) report the game took place on March 28, 2025. The Jets won 4-0. For example, source [7] mentions the Jets' 4-0 victory with Hellebuyck's shutout. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nSources [2] and [5] refer to a 2017 game that was postponed, but that's irrelevant here. The 2025 game proceeded as planned. All recent sources confirm the Jets' win. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (Jets). No conflicting info found. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe New Jersey Devils and Winnipeg Jets played their scheduled game on March 28, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The Jets defeated the Devils 4-0, with Connor Hellebuyck recording a shutout[7][10][12][14]. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred as planned, with no indications of postponement or cancellation.  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- Winnipeg scored two goals within the first 1:52 of the game[9][14].  \n- Alex Iafallo (2 goals), Mark Scheifele, and David Gustafsson scored for the Jets[7][12].  \n- The Devils were shut out for the eighth time in the 2024-25 season[13].  \n\nSince the Jets won decisively, the market resolves to **p1** (Jets).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that the Winnipeg Jets won the game 4-0, which aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt that specifies the market should resolve to \"p1\" if the Jets win.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and gathers evidence from multiple sources to verify the outcome. The response also correctly ignores irrelevant information about a past game from 2017, focusing solely on the event in question.\n\nThe verification of the event and the alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response provides specific details about the game, such as the score, key players, and specific events during the game, which supports the resolution recommendation of \"p1.\"\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, ensuring that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409079 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:17:59 UTC"
