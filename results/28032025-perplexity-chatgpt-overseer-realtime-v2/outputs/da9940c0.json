The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Kentucky vs. Tennessee CBB game scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:39 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Kentucky wins, it's p2 (Tennessee p1, etc.), and the resolution conditions map p1 to Tennessee, p2 to Kentucky, p3 to 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was supposed to happen on March 28, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] states Kentucky lost to Tennessee 78-65 in the Sweet 16 on March 28. Source [4] also mentions the 78-65 loss, ending Kentucky's season. The YouTube highlights in [2] and [5] support this, showing Tennessee's victory. Additionally, source [6] from UK Athletics confirms the loss. All sources agree Tennessee won, so the market should resolve to p1 (Tennessee). No indications of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Sweet 16 game between the Kentucky Wildcats and Tennessee Volunteers occurred on March 28, 2025, as scheduled. **Tennessee defeated Kentucky 78-65**, advancing to the Elite Eight while ending Kentucky's season with a 24-12 record[1][4][6]. Key factors included Tennessee\u2019s defensive dominance (limiting Kentucky to 6/15 three-point shooting compared to 12 threes in prior matchups) and superior bench production (23-6 advantage in bench points)[1][4]. Zakai Zeigler led Tennessee with 13 first-half points[4], while Lamont Butler\u2019s 18 points and 6 rebounds were Kentucky\u2019s top performance[1][6].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up conditions apply. Based on the resolution terms, the outcome maps to **Tennessee\u2019s victory**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
