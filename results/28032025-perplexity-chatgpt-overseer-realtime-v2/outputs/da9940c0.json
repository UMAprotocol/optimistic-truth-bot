        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Kentucky vs. Tennessee game. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:39 PM ET. The current date provided is March 29, 2025, so the game has already taken place. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event, which would have resulted in p4. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the search results. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [1] from UK Athletics clearly states that Kentucky lost to Tennessee 78-65 in the NCAA Sweet 16 on March 28. The article details the game's progression, including scores at halftime and key player stats. This is a primary source from Kentucky's official site, so it's reliable.\n\nResult [2] from On3.com also confirms Tennessee's victory, mentioning the final score of 78-65. It discusses how Tennessee controlled the tempo, which aligns with the game details in [1]. \n\nResult [3] from Tennessee's official sports site reports their win over Kentucky with the same score, 78-65, advancing them to the Elite Eight. This is another primary source, adding credibility.\n\nOther sources like [6], [7], and [9] provide pre-game information, but since the game has already happened, the post-game reports in [1], [2], and [3] are more relevant. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Tennessee wins, the resolution is p1. Since all verified sources confirm Tennessee's victory, the correct resolution is p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. All post-game sources agree on the outcome, so there's no discrepancy. Therefore, confidently resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nTennessee defeated Kentucky 78-65 in their NCAA Sweet 16 matchup on March 28, 2025, as verified by multiple authoritative sources including both teams' official athletic websites[1][2][3]. The game occurred on schedule without postponement or cancellation, with Tennessee controlling the tempo and securing a double-digit victory through strong defensive play and efficient scoring[1][2][3]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response uses multiple reliable sources, including both teams' official athletic websites, which are appropriate and trustworthy for verifying the event's outcome. The response adheres strictly to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and not predicting or assuming outcomes without evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the sequence of verification, starting from confirming the event date and time, checking the outcome through reliable sources, and aligning the resolution with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The reasoning is clear, structured, and leads to a conclusive resolution based on the evidence provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was neither postponed nor canceled. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Tennessee win) directly with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any unnecessary reliance on irrelevant or unverified sources and maintains objectivity by corroborating information across multiple authoritative sources.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria effectively.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743238576 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 08:56:16 UTC"
