The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump using that specific phrase within the specified timeframe. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the period in question has already passed. \n\nLooking through the search results:\n\n1. **Result [2]**: Mentions a White House Black History Month event on February 20, 2025. This is before the March 21 start date, so it's outside the window.\n2. **Result [5]**: Discusses Trump's actions in February 2025, including executive orders and symbolic moves, but no mention of the phrase \"the blacks.\"\n3. **Result [6]**: Details Trump's interactions with the Congressional Black Caucus in 2017 and 2025. The 2025 reference is about a comment on Schumer, not using \"the blacks.\"\n4. **Result [7]**: From February 2024, where Trump claims his indictments boosted appeal to Black voters. The term used is \"Black population,\" not \"the blacks.\"\n5. **Result [8]**: Dated March 22, 2025, discusses policy reversals but doesn't mention Trump using the phrase.\n6. **Other results ([1], [3], [4])**: Focus on Project 2025 and policies affecting Black Americans but don't report any specific instances of Trump saying \"the blacks\" in the given timeframe.\n\nNone of the search results indicate that Trump used the exact phrase \"the blacks\" between March 21 and March 28, 2025. The latest relevant result is from March 22, 2025, which doesn't mention the term. Since there's no evidence in the provided sources, the resolution should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided search results, there is no evidence that Donald Trump used the phrase \"the blacks\" between March 21, 2025 (6:10 PM ET) and March 28, 2025 (11:59 PM ET). The latest relevant information from March 22, 2025[8] discusses policy reversals related to civil rights but contains no reference to this specific terminology. Earlier 2025 events like the February Black History Month celebration[2] and March interactions[6] also show no usage of this phrase.\n\nThe search results focus on:\n- Policy agendas like Project 2025's impacts on Black communities[1][3][4]\n- Trump's executive actions targeting DEI programs[5][8]\n- Political rhetoric about Black voters[7]\n- Historical racial controversies from Trump's first term[6]\n\nNone of these sources document Trump using the exact phrase \"the blacks\" during the specified March 21-28 window. While Trump discussed Black voters and populations during this period[7][8], the language used (\"Black population,\" \"Black voters\") doesn't meet the resolution criteria for \"the blacks.\"\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions by focusing on the specific timeframe (March 21 to March 28, 2025) and the exact phrase \"the blacks\" as outlined in the user prompt. The response correctly identifies that the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp and proceeds to analyze the available information rather than predicting or assuming outcomes.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks through various search results related to Donald Trump's statements and actions within the specified timeframe. It provides a clear rationale for why each result does not meet the criteria for a \"Yes\" resolution, focusing on the absence of the exact phrase \"the blacks.\" This shows a thorough and logical approach to resolving the query based on the evidence provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that none of the events or statements within the specified timeframe included the use of the phrase \"the blacks.\" It aligns this finding with a recommendation of p1 (No), which is consistent with the evidence presented and the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI has focused solely on verified facts and specific instances that could influence the resolution, adhering strictly to the user prompt's requirements.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation of p1 is appropriately justified with concrete evidence, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzes the specified timeframe and phrase, adheres to the instructions, and logically concludes based on the evidence provided. The recommendation aligns with the facts and resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided information to make a well-supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
