The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Miami Heat vs. Philadelphia 76ers game scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Heat win, it's p2 (Heat), if the 76ers win, p1 (76ers), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the game in question happened two days ago. Now, I need to check the search results to find out the actual outcome of that game.\n\nLooking through the search results, multiple sources mention the game. Result [1] is a YouTube video titled \"Miami Heat vs Philadelphia 76ers Full Game Highlights - March 29, 2025\" which indicates the game occurred. Result [3] from CBS Sports states the final score as a Heat victory, 118-95. Similarly, result [6] from Hot Hot Hoops confirms the Heat won 118-95. Result [9] from The Score also reports the Heat's win with Herro scoring 30 points. Result [13] is another YouTube recap titled \"Game Recap: Heat 118, 76ers 95\" and result [15] from CBS Sports again confirms the 118-95 score.\n\nAll these sources consistently report that the Miami Heat won the game on March 29. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The 76ers were eliminated from playoff contention with this loss, as noted in result [9] and [13]. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and the Heat won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no conflicting information in the search results, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Miami Heat defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 118-95 in their March 29, 2025 matchup at Wells Fargo Center[1][3][6][9][13][15]. Multiple sources confirm Tyler Herro led Miami with 30 points and 7 assists, while Philadelphia's Jared Butler had 19 points in the losing effort[1][6][14]. This outcome eliminates Philadelphia from playoff contention[9][13] and extends Miami's winning streak to four games[3][6][15].\n\n**Key details confirming resolution:**\n- Game occurred as scheduled on March 29 (current analysis date: March 31, 2025)[1][3][6]\n- Final score: Miami 118, Philadelphia 95[3][6][9][15]\n- No indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1-15]\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411012 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:50:12 UTC"
