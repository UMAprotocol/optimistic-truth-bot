If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 29, 2025, based on the provided sources. The resolution conditions specify that the answer must be \"Yes\" if the order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or through the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. Otherwise, it's \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check all the search results for any mention of an executive order signed on March 29. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: Dated March 30, discusses an executive order from March 30. Not relevant to March 29.\n2. **Source [2]**: March 28, mentions an executive order on making D.C. safe. Not March 29.\n3. **Source [3]**: February 3, about a regulatory freeze. Not relevant.\n4. **Source [4]**: March 25, an order on electronic payments. Not March 29.\n5. **Source [5]**: May 20, 2020. Old document, irrelevant.\n6. **Source [6]**: Lists orders from January and February 2025. No March 29.\n7. **Source [7]**: March 28, order on American history. Not the 29th.\n8. **Source [8]**: March 29, mentions an Executive Order Tracker but no specific order on the 29th.\n9. **Source [9]**: March 28, discusses various actions but nothing on March 29.\n10. **Source [10]**: March 6, timeline up to March 5. Doesn't cover the 29th.\n11. **Source [11]**: No dates mentioned that match.\n12. **Source [12]**: Lists orders up to March 20. No March 29.\n13. **Source [13]**: March 20, order to eliminate the Department of Education. Signed on the 20th, not the 29th.\n14. **Source [14]**: March 20, mineral production order. Again, not the 29th.\n\nNone of the sources mention an executive order signed on March 29. The closest is the March 30 order in source [1], but that's after the cutoff. The user's current date is March 31, so the deadline for publication would have passed. Since no sources indicate an order on March 29, the answer should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results provided, there is no mention of Donald Trump signing an executive order on March 29, 2025. The most recent executive orders referenced in the sources are:\n\n- March 30, 2025: An executive order on election procedures[1]\n- March 28, 2025: Orders related to Washington D.C. safety[2] and American history[7]\n- March 25, 2025: An order modernizing government payments[4]\n- March 20, 2025: Orders regarding mineral production[14] and education department closure[13]\n\nThe search results include an Executive Order Tracker updated through March 29, 2025[8], but it does not list any executive orders signed on that specific date. The White House presidential actions page and Federal Register sources specified in the resolution conditions show no records of an executive order published on March 29 or March 30 (the deadline for publication being 12 PM ET March 30).\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409945 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:32:25 UTC",
