        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Oakland Athletics vs. Seattle Mariners game on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Mariners, p2 is Athletics, and p3 is 50-50. The current date is March 30, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to find out the outcome of the game. Looking through the sources:\n\n- Source [10] and [11] both mention that the Athletics beat the Mariners 6-0 on March 28. Wait, but the game in question is March 29. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, source [10] is dated March 29 but describes a game where the Athletics won 6-0. However, the query is about the March 29 game. Let me check other sources. \n\nLooking at source [12], it mentions the Mariners lost 7-0 to the Athletics on Friday, March 28. Then source [13] and [14] discuss the March 29 game, with the Athletics' next game being against the Mariners on March 29. Source [6] and [8] confirm the March 29 game with probable pitchers Bryce Miller for the Mariners and Osvaldo Bido for the Athletics. \n\nWait, but the actual result of the March 29 game isn't directly mentioned in the search results. The latest game covered is March 28 (source [10], [11], [12]) where Athletics won 6-0 or 7-0. The March 29 game is previewed in sources [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [13], [14], but none of these provide the actual result. Since the current date is March 30, the game on March 29 should have already occurred. However, the provided search results don't include any sources that report the outcome of the March 29 game. All the results for March 29 are either previews, predictions, or odds, not the actual result. \n\nWait, source [10] and [11] mention a game on March 28 (Friday) where Athletics won. The next game would be March 29. But the search results don't include any post-game reports for March 29. The user's current date is March 30, so the game should have happened, but the provided sources don't have the result. \n\nIn this case, according to the ancillary data, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, we assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, the user's instructions say that if the event is in the past and no info is available, default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the personalization section says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in this case, the search results don't have the March 29 game result. All the sources about March 29 are previews. The latest result is March 28. Therefore, there's no verifiable information about the March 29 game. However, the user's current date is March 30, so the game should have occurred. But without any sources reporting the result, we can't confirm it. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is in the past, we have to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But if we can't infer it, default to p3 (50-50) or p4? Wait, the resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. The personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. Wait, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions are p1: Mariners, p2: Athletics, p3: 0.5. But the instructions say if no info, default to p4. Wait, the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in this case, the event date is March 29, which is in the past (current date is March 30). The search results don't include any post-game reports for March 29. Therefore, there's no verifiable information. So we have to check if we can infer the outcome. The previews suggest the Mariners were favorites, but without the actual result, we can't confirm. Therefore, since there's no information, we have to default to p4. However, the resolution conditions don't have a p4. Wait, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. But the personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. The user's ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 (50-50). So if the event occurred but there's no info, perhaps it's p3. But according to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info, and can't be inferred, default to p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the personalization instructions: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut the ancillary data only has p1, p2, p3. The user's query includes resolution_conditions with p3 as 0.5. However, the personalization says to return p4 if it can't be resolved. But the user's resolution_conditions don't have a p4. This might be a conflict. However, the user's ancillary data says \"resolution_conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.\" So p3 is 50-50. If the event can't be verified, perhaps it's p3. But according to the personalization rules, if the event is in the past and no info, and can't be inferred, default to p4. But the user's setup doesn't have p4. This is a problem. However, the user's ancillary data might have a typo, but given the data, p3 is the 50-50 outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the event was not played, but the sources don't mention cancellation. Since the search results don't include the result for March 29, and the current date is March 30, but there's no information, the correct resolution would be p3 (50-50) as per the user's ancillary data. However, according to the personalization rules, if no info, default to p4. But the user's setup doesn't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, the personalization section says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" So p4 is an option even if not in the user's resolution_conditions. But the user's resolution_conditions only have p1, p2, p3. So in this case, since the event date is in the past, and there's no verifiable information, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user's ancillary data says that if the game is postponed or not completed, it resolves to p3 (50-50). But without any info, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, but the result isn't in the provided sources. Since the sources don't include the March 29 result, but the current date is March 30, the assistant can't verify the outcome. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, and can't be inferred, default to p4. \n\nBut the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. However, the instructions say to end with p1-p4 regardless. Given that, and since there's no information in the search results about the March 29 game's outcome, the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, since there's no information, we can't infer the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is a problem, but according to the instructions, we must end with p4 if unresolved. Therefore, despite the user's setup, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe Oakland Athletics vs. Seattle Mariners game scheduled for March 29, 2025, at T-Mobile Park was not completed or officially recorded in the provided search results. While sources [6][8][14] confirm the game\u2019s scheduling and previews, no post-game reports or final scores for March 29 are included in the available data. The most recent verified result is the Athletics' 6-0 victory over the Mariners on March 28[10][11][12].  \n\nGiven the absence of verifiable information about the March 29 game\u2019s outcome and the event date being in the past, the resolution defaults to **p4** (unresolved due to insufficient evidence).  \n\nrecommendation: p4",
