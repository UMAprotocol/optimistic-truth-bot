        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Anoop Kuttysankaran made a public statement by March 28, 2025, regarding his alleged relationship with Divya Shashidar or about Prasanna Sankar. The resolution depends on whether such a statement was released by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results to see if any mention Anoop making a statement. The search results span from March 24 to March 26, 2025. The deadline here is March 28, so the results up to March 26 are before the deadline, but there's no data beyond that. \n\nLooking through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: Dated March 26, mentions Anoop's alleged affair but no statement from him. Prasanna shared messages, but Anoop himself hasn't commented.\n2. **Source [2]**: March 25, again discusses the accusations but no statement from Anoop.\n3. **Source [3]**: March 25, YouTube video summary. Mentions Prasanna's claims but no Anoop statement.\n4. **Source [4]**: March 24, includes Divya's accusations against Prasanna but nothing from Anoop.\n5. **Source [5]**: March 24, details the WhatsApp messages but no Anoop statement.\n6. **Source [6]**: March 24, Prasanna's tweets and allegations, no mention of Anoop responding.\n7. **Source [7]**: March 24, repeats the affair claims without Anoop's input.\n8. **Source [8]**: March 24, same as others, no Anoop statement.\n9. **Source [9]**: March 25, discusses the custody battle but no Anoop statement.\n10. **Source [10]**: March 24, allegations by Prasanna, no Anoop response.\n11. **Source [11]**: March 24, similar to others, no statement from Anoop.\n12. **Source [12]**: March 26, unrelated to the query.\n13. **Source [13]**: March 26, unrelated.\n14. **Source [14]**: March 24, same as previous articles, no Anoop statement.\n\nAll sources up to March 26 mention the allegations and the messages Prasanna shared, but none indicate that Anoop made any public statement. The deadline is March 28, but the latest available information is March 26. Since there's no evidence in the provided search results of Anoop releasing a statement by March 28, the market should resolve to \"No\". \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if there's no verifiable information by the event date (which is in the past here), we default to the most probable outcome. Since no sources mention a statement from Anoop, the answer is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results provided, there is no verifiable evidence that Anoop Kuttysankaran released any public statement about his alleged relationship with Dhivya Sashidhar or regarding Prasanna Sankar by the March 28, 2025 deadline. Key details from the sources:\n\n- Multiple articles confirm Prasanna Sankar's allegations about the affair, including screenshots of messages and hotel bookings allegedly provided by Anoop's wife[1][5][6][10]. However, **none of the sources mention Anoop Kuttysankaran issuing any public statements** about these claims.\n\n- The most recent articles (dated March 25-26, 2025) focus on Dhivya's counter-accusations against Prasanna and ongoing custody battles[3][9], but **no credible reports indicate Anoop addressed the allegations publicly** before the resolution deadline.\n\n- The primary resolution source specified (Anoop himself) shows no activity, and secondary sources (media reports) contain no statements from him[1-14]. All references to Anoop derive from Prasanna's social media posts or third-party accounts.\n\nGiven the absence of confirmed statements from Anoop Kuttysankaran by March 28, 2025, and no consensus in credible reporting about such a statement, this market resolves to **No**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on whether Anoop Kuttysankaran made a public statement by the specified deadline. The response correctly identifies that no such statement was made according to the sources reviewed up to March 26, 2025. This is in line with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking each source for evidence of a statement from Anoop Kuttysankaran. It correctly concludes that since no statement was found in the sources up to two days before the deadline, and no additional information is available beyond that date, the most probable outcome is that no statement was made by the deadline. This reasoning is sound given the data provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event in question (Anoop's public statement) did not occur by the deadline according to the available sources. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) aligns with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The response does not include any irrelevant information or assumptions beyond what is presented in the sources. It strictly adheres to the event and context as outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It accurately and completely addresses the query based on the information available, adheres strictly to the instructions, and logically concludes based on the evidence from the sources.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409260 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:21:00 UTC",
