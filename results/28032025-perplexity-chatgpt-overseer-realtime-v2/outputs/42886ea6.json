        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Anoop Kuttysankaran made a public statement by March 28, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether such a statement exists either from Anoop himself or credible reports confirming it. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any mention of Anoop Kuttysankaran releasing a statement. The search results span from March 24 to March 26, 2025. The key dates here are important because the deadline is March 28. \n\nLooking through the sources, most of them discuss the allegations made by Prasanna Sankar against his wife Divya and Anoop. Several articles mention that Prasanna shared screenshots of messages between Divya and Anoop, which he claims were provided by Anoop's wife. For example, sources [1], [5], [7], and [10] mention these messages and hotel bookings as evidence of the affair. However, none of the search results indicate that Anoop himself made a public statement. \n\nThe latest search result is from March 26, 2025, which is still before the March 28 deadline. However, even in the most recent articles, there's no mention of Anoop responding or issuing any statement. All the information about the affair comes from Prasanna's social media posts and the screenshots he shared. There's no credible reporting from news outlets that Anoop has made any public comments. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that a consensus of credible reporting can be used if Anoop himself doesn't release a statement. But the search results don't show any such reports. All references to Anoop are based on Prasanna's allegations and the provided screenshots, not on any statements from Anoop. \n\nSince the deadline has passed (current date is March 29, 2025), and there's no evidence in the search results of a statement by Anoop or credible reports confirming it by March 28, the resolution should be \"No\". Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether Anoop Kuttysankaran released a public statement about his alleged relationship with Divya Shashidar or Prasanna Sankar by March 28, 2025. Based on the provided search results, **no credible evidence indicates that Anoop Kuttysankaran made such a statement** by the deadline. \n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Allegations and Evidence**:  \n   - Prasanna Sankar publicly accused his wife, Divya Shashidar, of having a six-month affair with Anoop Kuttysankaran, sharing screenshots of alleged WhatsApp messages and hotel bookings[1][5][7][10]. These messages were reportedly provided by Anoop\u2019s wife[5][7].  \n   - Divya denied the allegations and counter-accused Prasanna of sexual misconduct and kidnapping their son[5][15].  \n\n2. **Anoop\u2019s Involvement**:  \n   - While Anoop is repeatedly named in the dispute, **none of the search results mention Anoop releasing a personal statement** addressing the allegations or the relationship. All references to Anoop derive from Prasanna\u2019s claims or Divya\u2019s rebuttals[1][5][7][10].  \n   - No credible third-party reports confirm Anoop\u2019s direct involvement beyond the screenshots shared by Prasanna.  \n\n3. **Timeline**:  \n   - The latest search result is dated March 26, 2025[14], two days before the March 28 deadline. None of the subsequent updates (up to the current date of March 29, 2025) indicate a statement from Anoop.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nSince **no verifiable public statement from Anoop Kuttysankaran** exists in the provided sources, and no credible reporting confirms such a statement by the deadline, the market resolves to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743223202 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 04:40:02 UTC",
