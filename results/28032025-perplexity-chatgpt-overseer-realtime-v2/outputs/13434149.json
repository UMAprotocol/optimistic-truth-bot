        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Cleveland Guardians and Kansas City Royals on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to p1 (Royals win), p2 (Guardians win), or p3 (50-50) based on the official outcome. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the game date, so it's in the past. The search results mention the game took place on March 29, with the Royals winning 4-3 [1][3][5]. Sources like the Associated Press article [1] and MLB.com [3] confirm the Royals' victory. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no postponement or cancellation. The game details in the search results indicate it was played, with specific innings and player performances described. There's no mention of the game being suspended or not completed. The box score from Fox Sports [5] shows a full 9-inning game, so it was officially completed.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that the official MLB outcome determines the result. The Royals won 4-3, so the market should resolve to p1. All sources align on the outcome, and there's no conflicting information about the game's status. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Kansas City Royals defeated the Cleveland Guardians 4-3 on March 29, 2025, in a game that concluded without postponement or suspension[1][3][5]. Key moments included Maikel Garcia's game-tying home run and Bobby Witt Jr.'s go-ahead RBI double in the seventh inning[1][3]. The game was played to completion under MLB rules, with Carlos Estevez securing the save for Kansas City[1]. \n\nSince the game began and ended on March 29 with an official result recorded by MLB, the market resolves to **p1** (Royals win) based on the ancillary data conditions.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
