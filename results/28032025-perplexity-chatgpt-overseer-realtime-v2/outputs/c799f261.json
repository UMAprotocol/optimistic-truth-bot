        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Pistons vs. Timberwolves game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Pistons win, it's p2; if the Timberwolves win, p1. If postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 30) is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [1] from CBS Sports mentions the game on March 30 with a final score of Timberwolves 123-104 Pistons. Similarly, ESPN's recap [6] and other sources like [3], [4], and [5] all report the game occurred with the same outcome.\n\nNext, verify the winner. All sources consistently state the Timberwolves won. The AP report in [1] and [6] both mention the 123-104 victory. The YouTube video [2] also confirms the Timberwolves' win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution conditions for p3 don't apply here.\n\nCheck for any discrepancies. The box score in [8] shows the Timberwolves with higher points, aligning with the reported score. The fight during the game led to ejections, but that doesn't affect the game's outcome. The ancillary data doesn't mention any conditions related to in-game events like ejections, only the final result.\n\nSince the game was played, and the Timberwolves won, the correct resolution is p1. All sources agree, so there's no ambiguity. The answer should clearly state the outcome and recommend p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Pistons vs. Minnesota Timberwolves NBA game scheduled for March 30, 2025, concluded with a **123-104 victory for the Minnesota Timberwolves**[1][3][6]. The game featured a second-quarter brawl that resulted in seven ejections, including players and coaches from both teams[1][2][5]. Despite Detroit initially leading by 16 points in the first quarter[3], Minnesota dominated the third quarter with Anthony Edwards scoring 18 points in that period alone[1][4]. \n\nKey factors influencing the outcome:\n- **Ejections**: Detroit lost three rotation players (Isaiah Stewart, Ron Holland II, Marcus Sasser) and their head coach during the altercation, significantly impacting their depth[1][4][5].\n- **Third-quarter surge**: Minnesota outscored Detroit 38-23 in the third quarter, taking their first lead at 69-67 and never trailing again[1][3][6].\n- **Statistical dominance**: Rudy Gobert recorded 19 points and 25 rebounds for Minnesota, while Julius Randle added 26 points[1][3][6].\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **Timberwolves** (p1) as the decisive winner.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410682 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:44:42 UTC"
