        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the NBA game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Detroit Pistons on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Cavaliers win, it's p2; if the Pistons win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 31, 2025, and the game was on March 28, so it's already happened. That means I don't have to worry about future dates. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [9] from TSN clearly states that the Pistons won 133-122. It mentions Tim Hardaway Jr. scoring 32 points and the Pistons securing their first winning season since 2016. This is a reliable source, likely an official news outlet. \n\nAnother source, [14] from Sports Illustrated, confirms the same score and notes that this victory was historic for the Pistons, tripling their previous season's wins. \n\nAdditionally, the YouTube highlights in [13] and [9] describe the Pistons' win, with key players like Hardaway Jr. leading the charge. The box score in [4] shows the final score as well, with the Pistons having more points. \n\nAll these sources consistently report a Pistons victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, based on the ancillary data, the resolution should be p1 (Pistons win). \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in the query matches the sources. All sources refer to the March 28 game between the Cavaliers and Pistons, so there's no confusion with other games. \n\nNo conflicting information found. All evidence points to a Pistons win. So the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Pistons defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 133-122 in their March 28, 2025 NBA game at Little Caesars Arena. Despite missing key players like Cade Cunningham, the Pistons secured their first winning season since 2016 behind Tim Hardaway Jr.'s season-high 32 points and 7 three-pointers[9][14]. Donovan Mitchell led Cleveland with 38 points, including 22 in the fourth quarter, but couldn't overcome Detroit's 25-6 fast-break advantage and 44.1% three-point shooting[9][4].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: **Pistons 133** - Cavaliers 122[9][14]\n- Detroit's historic achievement: Tripled their 2023-24 win total (14\u219242), becoming the first NBA team to do so in consecutive 82-game seasons[14]\n- Game impact: Clinched Detroit's first playoff berth since 2019 while delaying Cleveland's 60th win[9]\n\nThe outcome meets the resolution criteria specified in the ancillary data, with no evidence of postponement or cancellation. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It uses reliable sources to verify the outcome of the game, which is that the Detroit Pistons won. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided (p1 for a Pistons win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response thoroughly checks for the possibility of the game being postponed or canceled and finds no evidence supporting these scenarios. It confirms the Pistons' victory through multiple sources, including TSN and Sports Illustrated, which are considered reliable. The response also cross-references the game's details across different sources to ensure consistency and accuracy in reporting the event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response ensures that the event discussed in the sources matches the event described in the user prompt. It verifies the game's score, key players' performances, and the date and teams involved, ensuring no mix-up with another event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not introduce irrelevant information or assumptions beyond what is verified by the sources. It strictly adheres to the facts as required.\n\nGiven the above points, the response is both accurate and complete, adhering strictly to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411360 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:56:00 UTC"
