The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Diamondbacks, p2 is Cubs, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 28. The search results mention several games in the series. Let's look at the dates. \n\nSearch result [1] is from March 29, 2025, discussing a game on March 28 where the Diamondbacks won 8-1. Result [5] also confirms the March 28 game with the same score. Result [14] from CBS Sports on March 29, 2025, has the headline \"Eugenio Su\u00e1rez hits 2 HRs... D-backs top the Cubs 8-1\" and mentions the date as Friday night, which aligns with March 28. \n\nThe official outcome, as per MLB rules, is crucial. All sources point to the Diamondbacks winning that specific game. There's no mention of postponement, cancellation, or suspension. The game was completed, so the resolution should be p1 (Diamondbacks). \n\nI need to ensure the event date matches. The query is about March 28, and the sources clearly reference that date with the Diamondbacks as the winner. No conflicting information found. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks played their scheduled MLB game on March 28, 2025, at Chase Field in Phoenix. The Arizona Diamondbacks won the game 8-1[1][5][14]. Eugenio Su\u00e1rez led the offense with two two-run home runs off Cubs starter Jameson Taillon, while Merrill Kelly pitched 5.1 innings of one-run ball for Arizona[5][14]. The game was completed without suspension or postponement, and the outcome was officially recorded by Major League Baseball[14].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410902 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:48:22 UTC",
