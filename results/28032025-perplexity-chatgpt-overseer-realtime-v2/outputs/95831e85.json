The user is asking about the resolution of a market based on the outcome of the Gujarat Titans vs Mumbai Indians IPL match scheduled for March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Gujarat Titans win, the market resolves to \"Gujarat\" (p2), if Mumbai Indians win, it's \"Mumbai\" (p1), and if the game isn't completed by April 4, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The match was on March 29, so it's already happened. The next step is to verify the result using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [7], [8]) confirm that Gujarat Titans won the match by 36 runs. For instance, source [1] states, \"Gujarat Titans beat Mumbai Indians by 36 runs,\" and source [2] mentions \"Gujarat Titans... thrashed Mumbai Indians by 36 runs.\" All the relevant articles from March 29 report the same outcome. \n\nSince the match was completed on its scheduled date and the result is clear, there's no need to consider the April 4 deadline. The ancillary data maps a Gujarat win to p2. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align on Gujarat's victory. No mentions of the match being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here. The resolution is straightforward based on the verified result.\n</think>\n\nThe Gujarat Titans defeated the Mumbai Indians by 36 runs in their IPL 2025 match held on March 29 at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium[1][2][3][4]. Multiple verified sources confirm GT posted 196/8 batting first, with Sai Sudharsan's 63-run knock being pivotal, while MI could only manage 160/6 in reply despite Suryakumar Yadav's 48[1][2][4]. The match concluded without interruptions or postponements, meeting all completion requirements specified in the resolution conditions.\n\n**Key Match Details**  \n- **Result**: Gujarat Titans won by 36 runs[1][2]  \n- **Date**: Completed March 29, 2025 (before April 4 deadline)[1][3]  \n- **Resolution Basis**: Full match played to conclusion with GT victory[4][7]  \n\n**Recommendation**: p2  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response correctly uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the match, which is that Gujarat Titans won by 36 runs. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition that if Gujarat Titans win, the market should resolve to \"Gujarat\" (p2).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It correctly concludes that since the match was completed and Gujarat Titans won, there is no need to consider the April 4 deadline for a 50-50 resolution. The response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the market based on the provided conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the reliability of the information. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not omit any crucial information necessary for the resolution of the market. It strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and uses verified facts to support its recommendation.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411436 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:57:16 UTC"
