        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Gujarat Titans vs Mumbai Indians IPL match scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Gujarat Titans win, the market resolves to \"Gujarat\" (p2), if Mumbai Indians win, it's \"Mumbai\" (p1), and if the game isn't completed by April 4, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 29, 2025, 6:38:45 PM UTC. The match was scheduled for 10:00 AM ET, which is 2:00 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the scheduled start, the event should have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [5], [7]) report that Gujarat Titans defeated Mumbai Indians by 36 runs on March 29, 2025. For example, source [1] states \"Gujarat Titans Beat Mumbai Indians by 36 Runs!\" and source [2] mentions \"Gujarat Titans secured a 36-run victory over Mumbai Indians.\" These are consistent across different articles, confirming the result. \n\nI also need to ensure the match was completed. The detailed scorecard in [7] and the mention of the match being concluded in [2] indicate the game was fully played without any interruptions leading to an incomplete result. There's no mention of the match being abandoned or postponed, so the completion condition is met. \n\nSince the Gujarat Titans won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to \"Gujarat,\" which corresponds to p2. The ancillary data's p2 is mapped to Gujarat, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nGujarat Titans defeated Mumbai Indians by 36 runs in their IPL 2025 match played on March 29 at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad[1][2][4]. The game concluded successfully with GT defending their total of 196/8 through strong bowling performances from Mohammed Siraj (2 wickets) and Prasidh Krishna (2/18)[2][4]. This result gives Gujarat Titans their first victory of the season while extending Mumbai Indians' losing streak to two matches[2][7].\n\n**Key Match Details**  \n- **Toss**: Mumbai Indians won and elected to bowl first[5]  \n- **GT Batting**: Sai Sudharsan (63 off 41) and Shubman Gill (38) provided a strong start[2][4]  \n- **MI Chase**: Suryakumar Yadav (48 off 28) and Tilak Varma (39 off 36) couldn't sustain momentum[2][4]  \n- **Completion Status**: Full 40 overs played with no interruptions reported[1][7]  \n\nThe match concluded before the April 4 deadline specified in the resolution conditions. Based on the verified outcome and ancillary data parameters:  \nrecommendation: p2",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743273479 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 18:37:59 UTC"
