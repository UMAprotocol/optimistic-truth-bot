The ancillary data specifies that if Auburn wins, it's p1; Michigan State, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 30, so it's already in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, multiple articles confirm that Auburn won the game. For example, source [1] states Auburn beat Michigan State 70-64. Source [2] and [4] also mention Auburn's victory, with Broome's performance highlighted. Even the official Michigan State website [15] and ESPN [16] report the loss to Auburn. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled, and Auburn emerged victorious. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Auburn). \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Some sources like [9] and [14] had predictions favoring Michigan State, but the actual results from the game day clearly show Auburn won. No sources suggest any issues with the game's completion. \n\nSo, the conclusion is straightforward: Auburn won, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nAuburn defeated Michigan State 70-64 in the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight game played on March 30, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][4][15][16]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, with Auburn securing its spot in the Final Four.  \n\n**Key Details:**  \n- **Final Score:** Auburn 70, Michigan State 64[1][16].  \n- **Game Context:** Auburn\u2019s Johni Broome led with 25 points and 14 rebounds, overcoming an elbow injury in the second half[1][4].  \n- **Outcome Implications:** The win marked Auburn\u2019s second Final Four appearance, while Michigan State\u2019s season ended at 30-7[1][15].  \n\n**Resolution Conditions Met:**  \n- The game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation[1][2][15].  \n- Auburn\u2019s victory aligns with the ancillary data\u2019s resolution parameter **p1** (Auburn win)[1][16].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Michigan State vs. Auburn game) and its scheduled date (March 30, 2025). It verifies that the game has already occurred by checking the current date (March 31, 2025). The response then confirms Auburn's victory through multiple reliable sources, which is consistent with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and finds none. The resolution recommendation (p1 for Auburn's win) aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable and consistent. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is based on verified facts that Auburn won the game.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any undue preference for unverified or irrelevant sources and sticks to the facts required for resolution.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the system prompt.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
