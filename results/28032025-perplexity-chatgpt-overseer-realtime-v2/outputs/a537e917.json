        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Congress will grant Trump more funds for deportations by June 30, 2025. The resolution depends on whether a bill with new or increased funding passes both the House and Senate by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of relevant legislation. The search results mention several key points. There's a Continuing Resolution (CR) passed in March 2025 that allocated additional funds to ICE for deportations [2][3]. The Senate and House have each passed budget resolutions directing significant funds towards immigration enforcement, with the Senate proposing $350 billion over ten years and the House $200 billion [6][11]. The Laken Riley Act, targeting deportations for nonviolent crimes, has cleared the Senate and is on track for passage [7]. However, ICE is reportedly short $2 billion, and the recent CR only provided an extra $500 million, which isn't enough [10]. \n\nThe CR in March 2025 did include increased funding, which might meet the criteria. But the main budget resolutions are still in process. Since the deadline is June 30, there's time for these to pass. Given the GOP control and some Democratic support, especially in the House, it's likely the bill will pass. The sources indicate ongoing efforts and allocations, so the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nCongress has already taken significant steps to grant additional funding for deportations, with several key legislative actions passed as of March 2025. The Continuing Resolution (CR) funding the government through September 30, 2025, allocated **$430 million more to ICE** for detention and deportation operations[2][3], along with **$136 million for immigration-related prosecutions**[2]. This follows a separate Senate-approved bill (the Laken Riley Act) that lowers the threshold for deporting undocumented immigrants charged with nonviolent crimes[7].\n\nThe legislative landscape shows:\n- **Senate/House budget resolutions** proposing $350 billion (Senate) and $200 billion (House) over 10 years for expanded enforcement[6][11]\n- **ICE's current $2 billion shortfall** despite recent funding increases[10]\n- **Bipartisan support** in both chambers, with 48 House Democrats and 10 Senate Democrats voting for recent enforcement bills[7]\n\nWhile the final FY2025 budget hasn't been fully enacted, the CR already satisfies the market's resolution criteria by explicitly increasing deportation funding through September 2025[2][3][9]. With GOP control of both chambers and demonstrated Democratic crossover support, the likelihood of meeting the June 30 deadline appears high given existing legislative momentum[7][11].\n\nrecommendation: p2",
