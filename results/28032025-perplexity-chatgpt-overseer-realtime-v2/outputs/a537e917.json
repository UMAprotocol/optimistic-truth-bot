        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Congress will grant Trump more funds for deportations by June 30, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The given current date is March 31, 2025. The deadline for the market resolution is June 30, 2025. Since the event is in the future relative to the current date, according to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4. Wait, but the query is about whether a bill will be passed by June 30, which is a future event. However, looking at the search results, there are recent developments in March 2025. Let me check the search results again.\n\nSearch result [13] from March 14, 2025, mentions that Congress passed a continuing resolution funding the government through September 30, 2025. This bill includes increased funding for ICE. Specifically, result [10] states that the House passed a CR allocating $9.9 billion to ICE, which is $485 million more than FY 2024. Result [3] from March 14, 2025, also mentions Congress approved a CR providing at least $430 million more to ICE for detention and deportation. \n\nSo, even though the deadline is June 30, the bill has already been passed in March 2025, which is before the current date of March 31. Wait, the current date is March 31, 2025, and the bill was passed on March 14. Therefore, the event (passing the bill) has already occurred. The user's query is whether Congress will grant more funds by June 30, but since the bill was already passed in March, the answer is Yes. \n\nBut I need to confirm if the bill explicitly includes new or increased funding for deportations. The search results [3], [10], and [13] all mention increased funding for ICE, specifically for detention and deportation. For example, result [3] says Congress approved $430 million more for ICE detention beds and deportation costs. Result [10] mentions a $485 million increase. \n\nTherefore, the bill has already been passed, meeting the condition for resolution to Yes (p2). Even though the deadline is June 30, the event has already occurred. The personalization rules state that if the event date is in the past, resolve based on verifiable information. Since the bill was passed before the current date, the answer should be p2. \n\nWait, but the market's resolution is based on whether a bill is passed by June 30. Since the bill was passed in March, which is before June 30, the condition is met. Therefore, the resolution should be Yes (p2). \n\nI need to make sure there's no conflicting information. All the recent search results from March 2025 indicate that Congress has already approved increased funding. Therefore, the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nCongress has already passed legislation providing increased funding for deportations as part of the FY 2025 budget process. The Continuing Resolution (H.R. 1968) approved on March 14, 2025 allocates **$9.9 billion to ICE** - a $485 million increase from FY 2024 levels[10][13]. This includes specific funding boosts for:\n\n- **Detention beds** (+$430 million)[3]\n- **Deportation operations** and transportation[3][10]\n- **Border security technology** and personnel[9][11]\n\nThe legislation passed both chambers (House 217-213, Senate 54-46) before being signed into law[13], meeting the market's requirement for passage by both House and Senate. While the original Senate proposal sought $350 billion for enforcement[1][6], the final bill represents a significant funding increase that explicitly supports expanded deportation efforts.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event in question (passage of a bill including funding for deportations) has already occurred before the specified future date (June 30, 2025). The response correctly uses the current date (March 31, 2025) to determine that the event is in the past and thus can be resolved. The response adheres to the instruction to resolve based on verifiable information if the event date is in the past.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the information from the search results, confirming that the bill passed includes specific allocations for deportation-related expenses, which meets the user prompt's conditions for a \"Yes\" resolution. The reasoning is thorough, checking that the bill explicitly includes new or increased funding for deportations, which is a key requirement of the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event through multiple search results and aligns the recommendation (p2 for Yes) with the facts presented. It confirms that the bill was passed by both the House and Senate and signed into law, which satisfies the market's resolution requirements.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event specified in the user prompt and uses credible search results to support its conclusions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns correctly with the verified facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's conditions.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
