        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Trail Blazers vs. Knicks game on March 30, 2025. The key points are determining the outcome based on verified facts and the given resolution conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, and the game was scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. Since March 30 is in the past, the event has already occurred. \n\nNext, I need to verify the game's result using the provided search results. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [1] from ESPN shows the final score as Knicks 114 and Trail Blazers 113. However, this seems to be from March 12, 2025, which was their previous meeting. The same source also mentions a game on March 30, but the live score isn't finalized there. \n\nResult [3] is a YouTube video titled \"INSANE OT ENDING Knicks vs Blazers\" from March 12, 2025, which again refers to the earlier game. \n\nResult [7] is another YouTube video from March 30, 2025, titled \"New York Knicks VS Portland Trail Blazers Game 3rd Highlights Mar 30,2025.\" The transcript mentions the Knicks being down and then making a comeback, but the exact final score isn't clear from the snippets. \n\nResult [8] from ESPN's game summary for March 12, 2025, confirms the Knicks won 114-113 in overtime. \n\nResult [12] from The Columbian also reports the March 12 game with the same score. \n\nLooking at result [15] from thescore.com, the Knicks are listed with a 46-27 record, and the Trail Blazers at 32-42 after the March 30 game. This suggests the Knicks won, as their record improved from 45-27 in earlier results to 46-27 here. \n\nResult [16] from NBC Sports mentions the Knicks' record as 46-27 after the game, indicating a win. \n\nResult [18] from SI.com states the Knicks' record as 46-27 post-game, confirming their victory. \n\nPutting this together, the Knicks won the March 30 game, improving their record to 46-27. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to \"Knicks,\" which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Knicks defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in their March 30, 2025 matchup. Post-game records show the Knicks improved to 46-27[15][16][18], while the Trail Blazers fell to 32-42[15]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions where a Knicks victory corresponds to **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of event, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Verification of Event**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Trail Blazers vs. Knicks game on March 30, 2025) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 31, 2025). The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which consistently indicate a Knicks victory. The use of post-game records to confirm the Knicks' improved record further supports the conclusion that the Knicks won the game.\n\n2. **Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by focusing solely on verified facts to determine the outcome of the event. It does not speculate or predict but uses concrete evidence from reliable sources to resolve the query.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources, dismissing irrelevant data from a previous game on March 12, 2025, and focusing on the specific game in question. It comprehensively gathers evidence from multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring that the reasoning is robust and well-supported.\n\n4. **Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Knicks\" (p1) aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Knicks win corresponds to p1. The response ensures that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided.\n\n5. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI effectively uses the information available to it without showing any preference or bias towards either team. All sources are appropriately checked for their relevance and accuracy concerning the event date.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743380354 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 00:19:14 UTC"
