The user wants to know if Tennessee made the 2025 Final Four, based on the provided search results and ancillary data. \n\nFirst, I need to check the resolution conditions. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if Tennessee advances, \"No\" (p1) if they're eliminated, and p3 if it's unknown. The current date is March 31, 2025, and the Final Four is determined by May 31, so timing isn't an issue here.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the outcome of the Elite Eight game between Houston and Tennessee. Source [1] from ESPN states that Houston defeated Tennessee 69-50, advancing to the Final Four. It specifically notes that Tennessee failed to reach their first Final Four. Source [4] from Bleacher Report also confirms Houston's victory, eliminating Tennessee. Additionally, source [7] from CBS Sports grades Tennessee's performance as a 'D' in their loss to Houston. Source [9] from SI.com mentions that Houston is part of the Final Four, while Tennessee is not listed among the teams advancing.\n\nAll these sources consistently report that Tennessee lost to Houston in the Elite Eight, which means they were eliminated and did not make the Final Four. There's no conflicting information in the search results. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nHouston defeated Tennessee 69-50 in the Elite Eight of the 2025 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, eliminating the Volunteers and preventing them from reaching their first Final Four in program history[1][4][7]. The game featured a dominant defensive performance by Houston, which held Tennessee to 15 first-half points and 28.8% shooting overall[1][4]. With this loss, Tennessee's season ended in the Elite Eight for the second consecutive year, maintaining their status as the program with the most Sweet 16 appearances (10) without a Final Four berth[1][6].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It correctly identifies that the event in question (Tennessee's participation in the 2025 Final Four) is a future event relative to the current timestamp (March 31, 2025). The response uses verified facts from reliable sources such as ESPN, Bleacher Report, CBS Sports, and SI.com to confirm that Tennessee did not advance to the Final Four, having been defeated by Houston in the Elite Eight.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from multiple sources to conclude that Tennessee was eliminated from the tournament. It provides a detailed account of the game's outcome and Tennessee's performance, which supports the resolution condition of the market resolving to \"No\" (p1) if Tennessee is eliminated.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's outcome through multiple independent sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which stipulates this resolution if Tennessee does not make the Final Four.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt and uses the appropriate sources for verification.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409986 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:33:06 UTC"
