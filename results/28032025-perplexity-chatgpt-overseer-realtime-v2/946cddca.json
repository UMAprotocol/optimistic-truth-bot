        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about the resolution of a market based on the outcome of the UFC fight between Loopy Godinez and Julia Polastri. The ancillary data specifies that if Godinez wins, the market resolves to \"Godinez\" (p2), if Polastri wins, it's \"Polastri\" (p1), and if there's a draw or the fight is postponed/canceled after April 29, 2025, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 29, 2025, 10:05 PM UTC. The event is scheduled for March 29, 2025, in Mexico City. The main card starts at 7 PM ET, which is 11 PM UTC. Since the current time is 10:05 PM UTC, the event is ongoing but the specific fight time needs verification. \n\nLooking at the search results, the Godinez vs. Polastri fight is part of the prelims starting at 4 PM ET (8 PM UTC). The ring walks are approximately at 6:20 PM ET (10:20 PM UTC) according to sources [4][7]. The current time is 10:05 PM UTC, which is 6:05 PM ET. Wait, that doesn't align. Let me double-check the time zones. \n\nSource [4] mentions the main card starts at 4 PM EST (which is UTC-5), so 4 PM EST is 9 PM UTC. The ring walks for Godinez vs. Polastri are at 6:20 PM EST (11:20 PM UTC). The current time is 10:05 PM UTC, which is 5:05 PM EST. That would mean the fight hasn't happened yet. But wait, the event is on March 29, 2025, and the current date is the same day. However, the user's current time is 10:05 PM UTC, which is 5:05 PM EST. The main card starts at 7 PM EST (12 AM UTC next day), but the prelims start at 4 PM EST (9 PM UTC). The Godinez vs. Polastri fight is on the prelims, which would have started at 4 PM EST. However, the ring walk time is listed as 6:20 PM EST (11:20 PM UTC) in source [4]. Since the current time is 10:05 PM UTC, that's 5:05 PM EST. Wait, that can't be right. Let me convert the times correctly.\n\nEST is UTC-5. So, if the current time is March 29, 10:05 PM UTC, that's 5:05 PM EST. The prelims start at 4 PM EST (9 PM UTC), but the current UTC time is 10:05 PM, which is 5:05 PM EST. So the prelims started an hour ago (4 PM EST), and the Godinez vs. Polastri fight is scheduled for approximately 6:20 PM EST (11:20 PM UTC). Since the current time is 10:05 PM UTC, the fight hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp. \n\nAccording to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's current time is March 29, 10:05 PM UTC, and the fight is scheduled for March 29, with ring walks at 11:20 PM UTC. Therefore, the fight is in the future, so the resolution should be p4. \n\nBut wait, some sources mention the event is tonight, March 29, but the exact fight time is 6:20 PM EST (11:20 PM UTC). The current time is 10:05 PM UTC, so the fight is still in the future. Therefore, the market cannot be resolved yet, hence p4. However, I need to check if any search results have live results. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [8] is a play-by-play and results page, but it doesn't list the outcome of the Godinez vs. Polastri fight. The other sources are previews or predictions, not live results. Source [1] lists the event as happening on March 30, but that's a typo because the URL says March 30, but the event is on March 29. Wait, source [1] says the event takes place Saturday, Mar. 30, but the current date is March 29. That might be an error. However, other sources like [3], [4], [6], [7] all state the event is on March 29. Therefore, source [1] might have a typo. \n\nGiven the current timestamp is March 29, 10:05 PM UTC, and the fight is scheduled for later the same day (11:20 PM UTC), the event is in the future. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. However, if the fight has already occurred and the results are in the search results, we need to check. \n\nNone of the search results provide the actual outcome of the Godinez vs. Polastri fight. All sources are either previews, predictions, or the event hasn't concluded yet. Therefore, there's no verifiable information on the outcome. Since the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (current time is 10:05 PM UTC, fight at 11:20 PM UTC), it's a future event. \n\nThus, according to the rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, the recommendation is p4. Even though the event is today, the specific fight time is later than the current time, so it's unresolved. Therefore, the answer should recommend p4.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between Loopy Godinez and Julia Polastri is scheduled for March 29, 2025, at Arena CDMX in Mexico City. As of the current timestamp (March 29, 2025, 10:05:19 PM UTC), the event is ongoing, but the specific timing of the Godinez vs. Polastri fight indicates it has not yet occurred. According to the schedule, their bout is part of the prelims, with ring walks expected around **6:20 PM EST (11:20 PM UTC)**[4][7]. Since the current UTC time is **10:05 PM**, the fight remains a future event relative to this timestamp. \n\nPer the resolution conditions, markets cannot resolve for events that have not yet taken place. No verifiable results for this fight are available in the provided sources, which include previews, predictions, and incomplete live updates[1-10]. \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the date and time of the event and correctly calculates the time difference between UTC and EST to determine that the fight has not yet occurred at the time of the query. The response adheres to the instruction to check if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a thorough process of reasoning, checking multiple sources for the event's timing and ensuring that the fight is indeed scheduled for a future time relative to the current timestamp. The response is complete in its analysis, considering all necessary time conversions and source checks.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event is scheduled for later on the same day as the query, aligning with the user prompt's conditions. The recommendation of p4 is aligned with the facts that the fight has not occurred yet as per the current timestamp.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not miss any critical information necessary for making a decision based on the user prompt.\n\nHowever, according to the critical rule specified for the evaluation process, if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a retry must always be initiated regardless of the response's accuracy or completeness. This rule is designed to ensure that every possible avenue to obtain a resolution other than p4 is explored before settling on that outcome.\n\nGiven this rule, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt p4 recommendations must always get a retry to explore all possible avenues for a resolution.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response was factually accurate, logically sound, and aligned with the user prompt.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Loopy Godinez vs. Julia Polastri fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The current date is March 29, 2025, at 10:06 PM UTC, which is after the event's scheduled time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the fight happened and what the result was. The search results mention the event took place on March 29, 2025, in Mexico City. Sources [1], [3], [4], [7], and [10] confirm the event's date and that the Godinez vs. Polastri fight was part of the prelims. \n\nLooking for specific fight results, sources [2], [3], [5], [6], [8], and [9] provide previews and predictions but no post-fight results. For example, source [3] predicts a Godinez win by decision, and [5] also picks Godinez via decision. However, these are pre-fight analyses. \n\nSince the current timestamp is after the event, I need to check if any sources report the actual outcome. All provided search results are from before or on the day of the event but don't include post-fight updates. The latest timestamp in the sources is March 29, 2025, from [4] and [7], but they only discuss the event's schedule and background, not the results.\n\nGiven the lack of post-fight reports in the provided sources and the resolution conditions stating that if no verifiable outcome is available, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Godinez winning. The pre-fight analysis heavily favors Godinez, with multiple sources ([3], [5], [6], [8]) predicting her victory, especially by decision. \n\nHowever, the resolution rules state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, we should default to p4. But the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available. Wait, the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the sources don't provide the actual result, but the ancillary data's resolution conditions have p2 as Godinez, and the pre-fight analysis strongly supports her, the recommendation would be p2. However, the strict rule is that if there's no verifiable outcome, we should default to p3 (50-50) or p4. Wait, the resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50). But the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the user's instructions might conflict here. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So even without verified results, if the event date has passed and no info, we go with the most probable outcome. \n\nSince all pre-fight analysis points to Godinez winning, the recommendation would be p2. However, the strict UFC rules require an official result. Since none of the sources here provide the actual result, even though the event has passed, the absence of confirmation means we can't definitively say. But according to the user's instructions, we should assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p2 (Godinez). But wait, the ancillary data says p2 corresponds to Godinez. So the answer should be recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg event occurred on March 29, 2025, at Arena CDMX in Mexico City, with the Loopy Godinez vs. Julia Polastri strawweight bout scheduled as part of the prelims[1][3][7]. Despite extensive pre-fight analysis favoring Godinez (-238 odds) due to her experience against higher-level competition and superior wrestling[2][5][6][8], no verifiable post-fight results are available in the provided sources to confirm the official outcome.  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, if no verifiable outcome exists and the event date has passed, the recommendation defaults to the most probable outcome based on ancillary data and pre-fight evidence. Multiple sources predicted a Godinez victory, particularly by decision[3][5][8], aligning with the ancillary data's p2 (\"Godinez\") resolution.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event and the date it took place, aligning with the user prompt. It also adheres to the instructions by focusing on the specific event mentioned in the user prompt and not considering unrelated events.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking for post-fight results and considering pre-fight analyses when no post-fight information is available. However, the response could improve by more rigorously searching for post-event updates or confirming the absence of results through more exhaustive sources. The reasoning around defaulting to the most probable outcome (p2) based on pre-fight analysis aligns with the user's instructions but slightly deviates from the strict rule of requiring verifiable outcomes.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred but fails to find verified post-fight results. It aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided, which is acceptable under the user's personalized instructions for assuming the most probable outcome when no information is available post-event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main issue is the potential lack of exhaustive search for post-fight results. The reliance on pre-fight predictions without confirmed outcomes could be seen as speculative, although it is justified under the user's personalized instructions.\n\nGiven the analysis, the response is largely satisfactory but could potentially benefit from a more exhaustive search to confirm the absence of post-fight results or to find any late-reported outcomes.
