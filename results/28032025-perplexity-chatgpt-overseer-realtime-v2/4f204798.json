The ancillary data says p1 is No, p2 is Yes, and p3 is unknown. The current date is March 30, 2025, which is after the scheduled Elite Eight game between Alabama and Duke on March 29. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the outcome of that game. Looking through the sources, result [14] from Sports Illustrated clearly states that Alabama's season ended in the Elite Eight with an 85-65 loss to Duke. That's a direct elimination. Other sources like [10] and [15] mention the game setup, but [14] is the key here. Since the game was on March 29 and Alabama lost, they can't advance to the Final Four. The resolution condition for \"No\" is p1. So the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nAlabama's bid to reach the 2025 NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four ended in the Elite Eight with an **85-65 loss to Duke** on March 29, 2025. The Crimson Tide, who set an NCAA Tournament record with 25 three-pointers in their Sweet 16 win over BYU, struggled offensively against Duke's defense, shooting just 5-of-19 from three-point range in the first half and failing to overcome a 13-point halftime deficit[14][4]. Duke's Cooper Flagg (18.7 PPG season average) and Kon Knueppel (21 points in the game) led a balanced attack, while Alabama's Mark Sears\u2014coming off a 34-point, 10-three-pointer performance against BYU\u2014was limited to one three-pointer in the loss[14][16].\n\nWith this elimination, Alabama cannot advance to the Final Four, triggering resolution condition **p1 (\"No\")** per the market rules. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
