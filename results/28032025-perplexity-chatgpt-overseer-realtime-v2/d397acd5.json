The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Canadiens vs. Panthers game scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Canadiens win, the market resolves to \"Canadiens\" (p2), and if the Panthers win, it resolves to \"Panthers\" (p1). If the game is postponed or canceled, there are other conditions, but the main focus is on determining who won the game on the specified date.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the game's outcome. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, which is the day after the game, so the event has already occurred. Let's look through the sources.\n\nSearch result [1] from the Canadiens' official site states they won 4-2 against the Panthers on March 30. Similarly, [2] from the Panthers' site also confirms the Canadiens' 4-2 victory, mentioning Nick Suzuki's game-winning goal. Source [3], a news article, reiterates the same score and outcome. The YouTube highlights in [5] and the Sportsnet article [7] both align with this result, showing Montreal's win. \n\nAdditionally, the game logs in [4] and [8] list the March 30 game as a loss for the Panthers against the Canadiens. All sources consistently report a Canadiens victory with a 4-2 score. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution should be based on the actual outcome. Since the Canadiens won, the market should resolve to p2 as per the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens defeated the Florida Panthers 4-2 in their NHL game on March 30, 2025, at Amerant Bank Arena[1][2][3][7]. Key highlights include Nick Suzuki's game-winning goal in the third period[1][3], Lane Hutson's three assists[3][7], and Samuel Montembeault's 24 saves[1][3]. The Panthers' goals came from Seth Jones and Sam Reinhart[3][7], but their seven-game home winning streak was snapped[2][6].\n\nThis result moved Montreal back into a playoff position[1][7], while Florida remained second in the Atlantic Division[4][8]. The teams are scheduled for a rematch on March 31, 2025[2][6].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
