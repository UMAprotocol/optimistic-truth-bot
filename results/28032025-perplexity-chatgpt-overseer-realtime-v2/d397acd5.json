The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Montreal Canadiens vs. Florida Panthers game on March 30, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Panthers win, p2 for Canadiens win, and p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date provided is March 30, 2025, 7:38 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (1:00 PM ET, which is 17:00 UTC). So the game should have happened.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [18] from ESPN provides live score updates. It shows the final score as Canadiens 4, Panthers 2. The detailed period breakdown confirms Montreal scored 4 goals against Florida's 2. Additionally, other sources like [16] and [15] mention the Canadiens had a 3-1 win earlier in the season and were on a five-game losing streak but still in playoff contention. However, the key source is [18], which directly reports the game's outcome with the Canadiens winning 4-2. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other sources like [1] and [3] are previews before the game, predicting a Panthers win, but the actual result from [18] is definitive. Since the game was completed and the Canadiens won, the resolution should be p2 as per the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens defeated the Florida Panthers 4-2 in their March 30, 2025, NHL game at Amerant Bank Arena. The Canadiens secured the win with an empty-net goal by Brendan Gallagher at 18:16 of the third period, extending their head-to-head dominance over the Panthers to three consecutive victories this season[18]. Key contributions came from Nick Suzuki (1 goal, 1 assist) and Lane Hutson (3 assists), while Sam Reinhart scored for the Panthers[18]. \n\nGiven the verified outcome and the resolution parameters specified, the market should resolve to **Canadiens** (p2). \n\nrecommendation: p2",

It uses reliable sources, specifically ESPN, to confirm the outcome of the Montreal Canadiens vs. Florida Panthers game. The response adheres to the instruction to base the resolution on verified facts and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided (p2 for a Canadiens win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the event's occurrence against the current date and time and by confirming the game's outcome through a credible source. It provides a detailed account of the game's score and significant contributors, which supports the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through a detailed examination of source [18] from ESPN, which is considered reliable for sports results. The alignment of the recommendation (p2) with the facts (Canadiens win) is accurate and meets the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The information provided is relevant and directly pertains to the query's requirements. All necessary details to resolve the market based on the game's outcome are included, and there is no extraneous or irrelevant information that could mislead the resolution process.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743363433 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-30 19:37:13 UTC"
