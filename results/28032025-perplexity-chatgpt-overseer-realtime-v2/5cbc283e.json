The ancillary data specifies that if the Nuggets win, it's p1; Jazz win is p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the event has already occurred. That means I don't have to worry about it being in the future. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [3] is an article titled \"Jokic has 27 points and 14 rebounds in Nuggets' 129-93 romp over Jazz\" from March 29, 2025. It clearly states that the Denver Nuggets beat the Utah Jazz 129-93. That's a decisive win. Source [5] provides the box score, showing the Nuggets with 129 points and the Jazz with 93. Additionally, source [8] mentions Jokic's performance and the Nuggets' 36-point victory, their largest of the season. \n\nOther sources like [7], [9], and [13] are video highlights confirming the Nuggets' win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game having taken place as scheduled with the Nuggets winning. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the correct resolution is p1 (Nuggets). I need to make sure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align here. No need to consider p3 or p2 since the outcome is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Denver Nuggets defeated the Utah Jazz 129-93 in their March 28, 2025 NBA game[3][5][8]. Nikola Joki\u0107 led the Nuggets with 27 points and 14 rebounds, while the team dominated with a 36-point margin of victory - their largest of the season[3][8]. Key factors included:\n\n**Game Outcome**\n- Final score: Nuggets 129, Jazz 93[3][5]\n- Denver outshot Utah 57.8% to 35.5% from the field[5]\n- Nuggets scored 64 points in the paint compared to Utah's 46[5]\n\n**Key Performances**\n- Michael Porter Jr. added 20 points for Denver[3]\n- Russell Westbrook contributed 17 points and 7 assists off the bench[7]\n- Utah's Collin Sexton led Jazz scorers with 20 points[3]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[3][5][8]. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market should resolve to \"Nuggets.\"\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409876 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:31:16 UTC"
