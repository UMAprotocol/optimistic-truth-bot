The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Utah Jazz vs. Denver Nuggets game scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Nuggets win, it's p1; if the Jazz win, p2; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 29, 2025, 3:24 AM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the event date is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [15] from Plain Text Sports shows the final score as Nuggets 129 - Jazz 93. That's a clear win for the Nuggets. Additionally, result [16] from USA Today's sportsbook wire also references the game, and while it doesn't give the score, other sources like [1], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [11], [12], [14], and [15] all indicate that the Nuggets were heavy favorites and had dominated the Jazz in previous meetings. \n\nResult [15] is particularly crucial because it's a live score update showing the game ended with the Nuggets winning 129-93. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the search results. All sources that discuss the game's outcome confirm a Nuggets victory. \n\nSince the event occurred, and the outcome is verified by multiple sources, the resolution should be p1 (Nuggets win). There's no conflicting information about the game's status or result. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Utah Jazz and Denver Nuggets on March 28, 2025, concluded with a decisive **129-93 victory for the Denver Nuggets**[15]. This outcome aligns with pre-game expectations, as the Nuggets were heavily favored (-17.5 spread, -2000 moneyline)[1][3][4] and had dominated the season series 3-0 prior to this matchup[1][6]. \n\nKey factors influencing the result:\n- **Nikola Joki\u0107** returned from injury to lead Denver with 39 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in their previous game[8], setting the tone for their performance.\n- Utah entered the game on a 14-loss streak in March[7][8], missing key players including Lauri Markkanen and John Collins[8].\n- Denver\u2019s offense averaged **127.7 PPG** against Utah in their three prior meetings[6], and their defensive execution limited the Jazz to 45% field goal shooting in this contest[15].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required. Based on the verified outcome and resolution conditions, the market should resolve to **Nuggets**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743218546 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 03:22:26 UTC"
