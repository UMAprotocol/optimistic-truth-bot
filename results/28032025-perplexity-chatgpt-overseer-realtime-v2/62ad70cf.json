        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the David Mart\u00ednez vs. Saimon Oliveira fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Oliveira, p2 is Mart\u00ednez, and p3 is a 50-50 split if the fight is a draw, postponed past April 29, 2025, or canceled. The resolution source is ESPN, but credible reports can be used.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date provided is March 29, 2025, 11:52 PM UTC. The event date is the same day, so the fight should have already occurred. Now, I need to look through the search results to find the outcome of this specific bout.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Result [1] is from ESPN's live coverage of the event. It lists David Martinez and Saimon Oliveira as part of the fight card but doesn't explicitly state the result of their fight. However, there's a mention of \"Jamall Emmers secures vicious TKO win in 1st round,\" but that's a different fight. The main event coverage focuses on Moreno vs. Erceg, not Mart\u00ednez vs. Oliveira.\n\n- Result [4] is a prediction article from Pickswise, dated March 29, 2025, which discusses the fight but doesn't provide the result. It mentions betting odds and analysis but no outcome.\n\n- Result [6] from Tony's Picks, dated March 25, 2025, also provides a prediction and detailed stats but no result. It highlights Mart\u00ednez as the favorite but doesn't confirm the fight's outcome.\n\n- Result [3] from Best Fight Odds lists betting lines, including \"Martinez wins by decision\" at +140 and \"Oliveira wins by submission\" at +800, but these are odds, not results.\n\n- Result [7] from FightMag and others discuss past events (2024) and other fights, not the specific 2025 bout in question.\n\nSince the current date is March 29, 2025, and the event is on that day, the fight should have just concluded. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the result of Mart\u00ednez vs. Oliveira. The ESPN link [1] is the primary source, but it only lists the fighters and some other fight results (like Jamall Emmers' TKO), not the specific bout in question. \n\nGiven that the resolution conditions state to use ESPN or credible reports, and none of the sources here confirm the outcome, I need to check if there's any indirect evidence. The betting odds in [3] and [6] heavily favor Mart\u00ednez, but that's not a result. Without explicit confirmation from ESPN or another credible source in the search results, I can't definitively state the outcome. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Mart\u00ednez winning. The betting odds and predictions all heavily favor Mart\u00ednez, so the most probable outcome is his victory. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg event on March 29, 2025, included a bantamweight bout between David Mart\u00ednez and Saimon Oliveira. Based on the available information, **David Mart\u00ednez** was heavily favored in betting markets, with odds ranging from -375 to -400, reflecting strong confidence in his striking accuracy (49%), defense (66%), and undefeated UFC record (11-1 overall, 1-0 in UFC)[4][6][7]. Oliveira, while experienced (18-5 record), faced challenges due to lower striking defense (48%) and recent losses[6][7].  \n\nNo direct result for this specific fight is explicitly listed in the provided sources. However, under the resolution conditions, when no verifiable outcome is available for a past-dated event, the market resolves to the **most probable outcome** based on ancillary data and pre-fight analysis. Given Mart\u00ednez\u2019s status as the clear favorite and Oliveira\u2019s vulnerabilities in striking exchanges, the recommendation aligns with the ancillary data\u2019s defined resolution for a Mart\u00ednez victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
