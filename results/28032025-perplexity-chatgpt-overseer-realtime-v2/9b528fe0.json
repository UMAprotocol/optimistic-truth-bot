If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Mets vs. Astros game on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p2 is for a Mets win, p1 for Astros, and p3 for a tie or unresolved. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 30, 2025, so the game in question (March 29) has already occurred. That means I don't have to worry about future dates or postponements. \n\nLooking at the search results, let's find the game result. Search result [1] from ESPN shows the Mets vs. Astros game on March 29 with the score Mets 3, Astros 1. The series was tied 1-1 before this game, and this was the third game. The box score in [1] confirms the Mets won 3-1. \n\nResult [2] is a YouTube video titled \"Mets vs. Astros Game Highlights (3/28/25)\" but the date might be a typo since the game on March 29 is discussed. The transcript mentions the Mets winning 3-1, with Edwin Diaz securing the save. \n\nResult [7] from WSLS explicitly states the Mets won 3-1 against the Astros, with Juan Soto hitting his first homer. Similarly, result [8] from ESPN UK's recap also confirms the Mets' 3-1 victory. \n\nThe other results like [3] and [4] are from earlier games in the series, so they're not relevant here. Result [5] is a prediction for the March 29 game, but the actual outcome overrides that. \n\nSince the game was completed on March 29 with an official result, the market should resolve to p2 (Mets win). There's no indication of the game being suspended or ending in a tie. All credible sources point to a Mets victory.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Mets defeated the Houston Astros 3-1 on March 29, 2025, in the third game of their series[1][7][8]. Juan Soto hit his first home run as a Met, a 390-foot solo shot in the third inning off Hunter Brown[7][8]. The Mets' bullpen preserved the lead, with Edwin D\u00edaz securing the save by catching the final out in right field[2][6]. This marked New York's first win in Houston since 2014[8].\n\nThe game was completed on its scheduled date without postponement or suspension[1][7], and Major League Baseball officially recorded the Mets as the winner[1][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
