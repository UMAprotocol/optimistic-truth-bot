If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Florida vs. Texas Tech NCAA Tournament Elite Eight game. The key here is to determine if the event has already occurred and what the result was, based on the provided search results. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current date given is Sunday, March 30, 2025, 12:33:16 AM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 6:09 PM ET. Since ET is UTC-4, the game would have started at 10:09 PM UTC on March 29. The current time is just past midnight UTC on March 30, so the game should have already taken place.\n\nLooking through the search results, most of them are previews, predictions, or live score setups, but none explicitly state the final result. However, result [15] from ESPN's live score page shows player stats and a live score interface, but it doesn't list a final score. Result [12] from Sporting News mentions live updates and highlights, but the highlights section only includes a three-pointer by Thomas Haugh making it 75-69 Texas Tech at 8:16 PM, which might be during the game. There's no conclusive final score mentioned in any of the provided sources.\n\nSince the event date is in the past and no sources confirm the outcome, according to the ancillary data, if the outcome can't be verified, the resolution defaults to the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided. The user's instructions state that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The search results include predictions favoring Florida, but without explicit confirmation, the resolution should default to p4. However, the ancillary data specifies p1 for Florida, p2 for Texas Tech, and p3 for 50-50. But the user's personalization rules say if the event is in the past and no info is available, default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions here are that if the game is canceled, it's 50-50 (p3), but if it's completed, resolve based on the winner. Since the game was scheduled and there's no mention of cancellation, but no result is found, the resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved). Wait, the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The user prompt's ancillary data says p1 is Florida, p2 Texas Tech. The search results have predictions leaning towards Florida, but without explicit confirmation, the resolution should be p1. However, the instructions also mention that if the event occurred but no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since the sources don't confirm the result, but the event date has passed, and the user's ancillary data doesn't specify p4, but the personalization rules say to use p4 if it's future. Wait, the event is in the past, so p4 isn't applicable. The correct approach is to resolve based on the most probable outcome. The majority of predictions in the search results (sources [2], [3], [4], [7]) suggest Florida is favored, so the resolution would be p1. However, without explicit confirmation, there's a conflict. But according to the user's instructions, if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
