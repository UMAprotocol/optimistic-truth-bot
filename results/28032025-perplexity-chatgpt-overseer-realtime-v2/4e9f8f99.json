The ancillary data specifies that if the Celtics win, it's p2; Spurs win is p1; postponed keeps it open, and canceled resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 29) is in the past. Let me look through the search results for any mention of this game's outcome. \n\nSearch result [1] is an article from March 30, 2025, titled \"Celtics beat Spurs for eighth straight victory, 121-111.\" It clearly states that the Celtics won the game on March 29. The score is 121-111, with Jayson Tatum leading the Celtics. This is a direct confirmation of the game's result. \n\nAdditionally, search result [4] from CBS Sports and [6] from YouTube both confirm the Celtics' victory on that date. The ESPN game recap [8] also lists the final score as 121-111 in favor of the Celtics. All these sources are consistent and reliable, indicating the game was played as scheduled and the Celtics won.\n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. In fact, the Spurs' next game is noted as against the Warriors on March 30, which aligns with the original schedule. The other search results about postponed games, like [2] and [7], refer to different games (Rockets vs. Hawks in January 2025 and a 2020 Thunder-Rockets game), so they're not relevant here. \n\nSince the game occurred on the scheduled date and the Celtics won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. No complications like postponement or cancellation apply here. All sources corroborate the Celtics' victory, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Celtics defeated the San Antonio Spurs 121-111 in their March 29, 2025, NBA game, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][4][6][8]. The game occurred as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with Jayson Tatum leading the Celtics to their eighth consecutive victory by scoring 29 points, grabbing 10 rebounds, and providing eight assists[1][8]. Since the Celtics won decisively, the market resolves to the outcome specified for a Boston victory. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Celtics vs. Spurs game on March 29, 2025) and verifies its outcome based on multiple reliable sources. The response adheres to the instruction to report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. The game's outcome is confirmed with a specific score and details about the performance of key players, which aligns with the requirement to verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event is in the past and then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources. The response is thorough in ensuring that no details about postponement or cancellation are overlooked, which is crucial for accurate resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence on the scheduled date and confirms the Celtics' victory. The recommendation of `p2` (Celtics win) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies `p2` for a Celtics win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any unnecessary reliance on irrelevant data and stays focused on the event in question.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation provided (`p2`) is appropriate based on the verified outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
