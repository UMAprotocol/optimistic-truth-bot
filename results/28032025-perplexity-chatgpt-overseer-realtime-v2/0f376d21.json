        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Colorado Rockies and Tampa Bay Rays on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves based on the official outcome of the game, with p1 for Rays, p2 for Rockies, and p3 if it's a tie, postponed, or suspended and not completed by March 30. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game was set for March 28 at 4:10 PM ET. Sources [1], [4], [6], [7], [8], [10], [12], and [13] all confirm the game was scheduled and even note the Rays' home opener was sold out. So the game wasn't postponed or canceled.\n\nNext, I need to determine the outcome. Source [6] provides a live score update: \"Bot 7, 1 out - J. Caballero singled off T. Kinley to drive in 1 run. COL 2 TB 2.\" However, this is mid-game, so I need the final result. Source [14] is a video titled \"Ryan Pepiot strikes out eight in first start of 2025,\" which indicates he pitched for the Rays. The description mentions he struck out eight over six innings, but doesn't give the final score. \n\nLooking at other sources, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final score of the game. The previews and predictions (sources [3], [5], [7], [9], [10], [12]) discuss expectations but not the actual result. The boxscore in source [2] and [6] might have the final score, but the snippets here don't show it. The YouTube video in [13] is a live stream, but the description doesn't include the result. \n\nSince the current date is March 28, 2025, 10:32 PM UTC, which is after the game's start time (4:10 PM ET, which is 8:10 PM UTC), the game should have concluded. However, without explicit confirmation in the provided sources, I can't definitively determine the winner. The ancillary data states that if the game began but wasn't completed by March 30, it resolves to p3. But since the game was played on the 28th and the current time is the same day, it's possible the game was completed. \n\nHowever, since the provided search results don't include the final score, I can't verify the official outcome. According to the rules, if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Rays were heavy favorites (sources [5], [7], [10]), but without confirmation, the safe resolution is p3 (50-50) due to lack of official data. But wait, the user's current timestamp is March 28, 10:32 PM UTC, which is 6:32 PM ET. The game started at 4:10 PM ET, so it's possible the game is still ongoing or just ended. However, the live score in source [6] shows the game was tied 2-2 in the 7th inning. If the game wasn't completed by the user's current time, and considering the ancillary data's rule about suspension, but the user's timestamp is the same day, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the ambiguity in the sources and the lack of a final score, the correct resolution is p3 (50-50) because the available information doesn't confirm the official outcome. However, if the game was completed and the Rays won, it would be p1. But without explicit evidence, I have to default to p3.\n</think>\n\nThe Colorado Rockies vs. Tampa Bay Rays game scheduled for March 28, 2025, was played as planned at George M. Steinbrenner Field with first pitch at 4:10 PM ET. The Rays' home opener was sold out[4][11], and starting pitchers Kyle Freeland (Rockies) and Ryan Pepiot (Rays) both began the game[1][6][14]. Live updates from the game show it was tied 2-2 in the 7th inning[6], but **no verifiable final score or official outcome** is provided in the available sources.  \n\nPer the resolution conditions:  \n- If the game began but wasn\u2019t completed by March 30, 11:59 PM, it resolves to 50-50 (p3).  \n- The current timestamp (March 28, 10:32 PM UTC) falls on the same day as the game, and no conclusive evidence confirms whether the game was suspended or completed.  \n\nWithout an MLB-verified result, this market resolves to **p3 (50-50)** under the ancillary rules.  \n\nrecommendation: p3",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the MLB game between the Colorado Rockies and Tampa Bay Rays on March 28, 2025, has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event in question and adheres to the user prompt's conditions for resolution. It accurately notes the game's scheduled time and checks for postponement or cancellation, confirming that the game was not postponed or canceled and was indeed played as scheduled.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking if the game occurred as scheduled and then attempting to determine the outcome based on available sources. However, it fails to provide a definitive outcome based on the final score, which is crucial for resolving the market. The response correctly concludes that without a verifiable final score, the market should resolve to p3 (50-50) according to the ancillary data provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the game took place but does not confirm the final outcome. It aligns with the ancillary data in resolving to p3 due to the lack of a verifiable final score. This is consistent with the user prompt's instructions for scenarios where the game's outcome cannot be confirmed.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors but lacks the final score, which is critical for a definitive resolution. The reliance on the game's ongoing status or recent completion without a final score leads to the recommendation of p3, which is a cautious but appropriate choice given the available information.\n\n**Decision**:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately follows the user prompt's instructions for resolution based on the available information and correctly concludes with a p3 resolution due to the lack of a verifiable final score. It adheres to the logical and factual requirements set by the system prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough in its attempt to verify the event's occurrence and check for the final outcome. However, it could improve by explicitly stating that further verification close to the end of the game might be necessary if new information becomes available shortly after the current timestamp.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThe response is satisfactory as it adheres to the guidelines provided, makes a logical conclusion based on the available information, and aligns with the ancillary data's resolution conditions.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743201087 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-28 22:31:27 UTC",
