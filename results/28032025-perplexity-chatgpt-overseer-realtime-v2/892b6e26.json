The ancillary data specifies that if Moreno wins, it's p2; if Erceg wins, p1; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 29, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The fight was on March 29, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 31, 2025. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to determine the outcome using the provided sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [6], [8]) report that Brandon Moreno won the fight by unanimous decision. All judges scored it 49-46 in his favor. The main event results are consistent across these sources, confirming Moreno's victory. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that ESPN is the primary source, but a consensus of credible reporting can be used. The ESPN article [4] predicted Moreno to win by decision, and the actual results from CBS Sports [1], MMA Junkie [2], PR Newswire [3], MyKhel [6], and the UFC's official site [8] all confirm the outcome. There's no mention of a draw or postponement, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nSince Moreno won, according to the ancillary data, the resolution should be p2. All sources align, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nBrandon Moreno defeated Steve Erceg by unanimous decision (49-46, 49-46, 49-46) in their UFC Fight Night main event bout on March 29, 2025[1][2][3][6][8]. All three judges scored every round identically in favor of Moreno, who secured his first UFC victory on Mexican soil after previous unsuccessful attempts[1][6]. The fight featured competitive striking exchanges across five rounds, with Moreno landing more impactful punches and maintaining consistent pressure throughout[1][3][6].\n\nThis outcome triggers the resolution condition specified in the ancillary data where a Moreno victory corresponds to \"p2.\" The result has been officially recorded by UFC and widely reported across multiple verified sources including CBS Sports, MMA Junkie, and the UFC's official platform[1][2][8]. There is no indication of any postponement, cancellation, or scoring controversy that would alter this resolution.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Brandon Moreno vs. Steve Erceg UFC Fight Night bout on March 29, 2025) and verifies that it has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. The outcome of the fight is reported with specific details (Moreno won by unanimous decision), which aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt. The use of multiple credible sources to confirm the outcome ensures adherence to the instruction of using verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event date and then verifying the outcome through credible sources. It correctly applies the resolution conditions (p2 for a Moreno win) based on the outcome. The detailed reporting of the fight and the unanimous decision adds to the completeness of the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, including ESPN, CBS Sports, MMA Junkie, PR Newswire, MyKhel, and the UFC's official site. This thorough verification ensures that the recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, biases, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's conditions and uses the specified resolution sources effectively.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411700 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:01:40 UTC"
