The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Mariners, p2 is Athletics, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 30) is in the past. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] from ESPN clearly states that the Mariners won 2-1 on March 30. Julio Rodriguez hit a two-run homer, and Bryan Woo pitched well. The recap mentions the final score and key players, which aligns with the official MLB outcome. \n\nOther sources like [6] (Mariners blog) and [7] (Fox Sports) also reference the game occurring, with [6] noting the series split after the March 30 game. The YouTube video in [4] shows Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz recording the save, confirming the Mariners' win. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed, suspended, or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game being completed officially. Since the Mariners won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The other search results like [2] and [8] discuss predictions before the game, but the actual result is in [1], [4], and [6]. No sources indicate a different outcome or issues with the game's completion. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Seattle Mariners defeated the Oakland Athletics 2-1 on March 30, 2025, in a game that concluded without postponement or suspension[1][4][6]. Julio Rodr\u00edguez's sixth-inning two-run home run proved decisive, supported by Bryan Woo's six-inning pitching performance (1 run, 3 hits) and Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz's ninth-inning save[1][4]. The game was declared official with both teams completing nine innings, as evidenced by the final box score and game recap from MLB sources[1][6].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the outcome of the Oakland Athletics vs. Seattle Mariners game on March 30, 2025, as a win for the Mariners. The AI used multiple sources (ESPN, Mariners blog, Fox Sports, and a YouTube video) to confirm the game's outcome, which aligns with the user prompt's requirement to use verifiable and reliable sources. The response adheres to the instructions by not predicting or assuming but rather confirming the event's occurrence and outcome based on past data.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks for the game's occurrence, confirms the outcome, and verifies that there were no interruptions or conditions (like postponement or suspension) that would alter the resolution conditions. The response also correctly aligns the outcome with the ancillary data provided (p1 for Mariners win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI effectively verifies the event using credible sources and ensures that the recommendation aligns with these facts. The detailed mention of key players and specific events within the game (like the home run and the save) further supports the accuracy of the information.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not overlook any alternative outcomes or contradicting information from the sources used. All information pertinent to resolving the query based on the user prompt's conditions is included and correctly interpreted.\n\nGiven this analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the user prompt and system instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Mariners win) is based on verified, factual information and is aligned with the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the event's outcome using verified sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and logically aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and ensures all conditions for resolution are met without any detected bias or error.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
