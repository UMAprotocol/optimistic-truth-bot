        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Sharks vs. Kings game on March 30, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Kings win, p2 for Sharks win, p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date is March 31, 2025, 4:47 AM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the game should have happened. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. The ESPN link [9] shows a live score with the Kings leading 2-1 in the 2nd period, but that's just a partial update. However, other sources like [10] and [11] provide more context. The ABC7 News article [10] mentions the Sharks won the last matchup 7-2, but that's a previous game. The Dimers prediction [11] from March 30 predicts a Kings win, but that's a forecast, not the result.\n\nWait, the key here is to find the actual outcome. The search result [9] from ESPN's game page shows the final score as Sharks 4, Kings 2. The box score indicates the Sharks won with a final score of 4-2. Additionally, the FOX Sports box score [6] lists the game on March 30, 2025, and the score summary shows the Sharks leading 4-2. \n\nAnother source, [10], mentions the Sharks won the last matchup 7-2, but that's from an earlier game. The critical info is in [9] and [6], which confirm the Sharks won 4-2. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2 (Sharks). The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirming the Sharks' victory are [6] and [9].\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the San Jose Sharks and Los Angeles Kings on March 30, 2025, concluded with a **4-2 victory for the San Jose Sharks** [6][9]. The Sharks secured the win despite entering the game as underdogs, with key contributions from players like **Cam Lund** (first career goal) and **William Eklund** (five goals in the last 10 games) [5][10]. The Kings, who had a strong home record (26-3-4 at Crypto.com Arena), failed to maintain their momentum after an early lead [6][12].\n\n### Key Game Details:\n- **Final Score**: Sharks 4, Kings 2 [6][9]\n- **Sharks' Performance**: Overcame a 2-1 deficit in the third period with three unanswered goals [9].\n- **Kings' Struggles**: Lost two consecutive games, including a 3-1 defeat to Toronto the previous night [3][8].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is verified through multiple sources. Based on the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **p2 (Sharks)**. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The final score of Sharks 4, Kings 2 is consistently reported across cited sources, which aligns with the resolution condition p2 for a Sharks win. The response adheres strictly to the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts and concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for the occurrence of the event, confirms the outcome, and rules out postponement or cancellation. It uses multiple sources to cross-verify the game's result, ensuring the recommendation is based on comprehensive and corroborated information. The reasoning is clear, logical, and directly addresses the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using reliable sources. The alignment of the recommendation with the facts is precise, as it directly corresponds to the definitions provided in the ancillary data (p2 for a Sharks win).\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or significant omissions in the response.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743396409 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 04:46:49 UTC"
