        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Adin Ross was unbanned from Twitch by December 31, 2025, based on the provided sources. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any official announcements or credible reports about Adin Ross's unban. Looking at the sources, multiple articles from March 2025 mention his unban. For example, source [1] states that Twitch unbanned him on March 29, 2025, after a two-year suspension. Source [2] confirms the ban was lifted on March 29, 2025, and mentions an upcoming stream. Source [3] and [4] also report the unban around the same date, with fans reacting. \n\nAdditionally, sources [5], [7], and [13] note that his Twitch account was reactivated, though his follower count was reset. There's also a mention in source [9] about a leaked unban date of March 29, 2025, which aligns with the other reports. \n\nThe key points here are the consistent dates across multiple credible sources (Jaxon.gg, Sportskeeda, Gamerant, etc.) confirming the unban happened on March 29, 2025, well before the December 31 deadline. Even though there's no direct link to Twitch.com, the consensus among these sources is strong. \n\nSince the resolution conditions allow using a consensus of credible reporting, and multiple sources confirm the unban occurred within the specified timeframe, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). There's no conflicting information suggesting the unban didn't happen or was after December 31. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nAdin Ross was unbanned from Twitch on **March 29, 2025**, after a two-year suspension that began in February 2023[1][2][5][7]. This reinstatement occurred under Twitch\u2019s updated moderation policies, which allow serious violations to expire after one to two years[1][13]. Multiple credible sources, including Jaxon.gg, Sportskeeda, and Gamerant, confirm the unbanning, noting that his Twitch channel was reactivated with a reset follower count[1][5][7]. While Twitch has not issued an official statement, the consensus across these reports satisfies the resolution criteria of relying on credible journalism[1][2][5][7][13]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410180 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:36:20 UTC"
