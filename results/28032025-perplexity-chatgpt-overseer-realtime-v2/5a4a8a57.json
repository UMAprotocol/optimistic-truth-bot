        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Warriors vs. Pelicans game on March 28, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Warriors win, it's p2 (\"Warriors\"), if the Pelicans win, p1 (\"Pelicans\"), and other conditions for postponement or cancellation. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 29, 2025, so the game date is in the past. All the search results mention the game took place on March 28, 2025. For example, source [1] states the Warriors won 111-95, and this is repeated in sources [5], [6], [7], [8], and [9]. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nNext, confirm the winner. Multiple sources report the Warriors' victory with the exact score. Stephen Curry's return is highlighted, and key players like Jimmy Butler contributed. The Pelicans were missing several starters, including Zion Williamson, which might explain their loss. \n\nSince the game occurred and the Warriors won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. No sources indicate any issues with the game's completion or cancellation. All evidence points to a clear Warriors win, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden State Warriors defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 111-95 in their March 28, 2025 matchup at Smoothie King Center[1][5][6][7][8][9]. Stephen Curry returned from a two-game injury absence to lead the Warriors with 23 points, including five three-pointers, despite shooting 7-21 from the field[1][5][8]. Key contributions came from Jimmy Butler (18 points, 10 rebounds) and Jonathan Kuminga (16 points)[1][5][6], while the Pelicans' Bruce Brown led all scorers with 18 points[1][5].\n\nThe Warriors overcame a slow start where they missed 14 of their first 15 three-point attempts[1][5], using an 8-0 third-quarter run sparked by Curry and Brandin Podziemski threes to take control[1][5][6]. A decisive four-point play by Buddy Hield with 7:12 remaining extended Golden State's lead to 100-85, effectively sealing the victory[1][5][8].\n\nThis result improves the Warriors' record to 42-31 as they continue pursuing a top-six Western Conference playoff seed[9], while the injury-depleted Pelicans (missing four starters including Zion Williamson) fell to 20-54[1][5][9]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation[1][5][6][7][8][9].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743238853 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 09:00:53 UTC"
