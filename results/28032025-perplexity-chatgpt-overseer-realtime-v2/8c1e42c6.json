The ancillary data specifies that if the Senators win, it's p2; Penguins win, p1; postponed remains open, and canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 30, so it's already in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual result of that game. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially sources [2], [3], and [5], they all mention the game's outcome. Source [2] from CBS Sports states that Sidney Crosby scored in overtime, giving the Penguins a 1-0 victory. The Ottawa Citizen article [3] confirms this, noting the Senators lost in overtime but got a point. The Senators' official site [5] also reports the 1-0 OT loss. \n\nEven though some pre-game predictions favored the Senators (like sources [1], [4], [6], [8]), the actual result from the game reports clearly shows the Penguins won. The ancillary data defines a win as the team that wins the game, regardless of it being in overtime. Since the Penguins won, the resolution should be p1. \n\nI also need to check if the game was postponed or canceled, but all sources indicate it was played as scheduled. Therefore, the market resolves to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins on March 30, 2025, concluded with a **1-0 overtime victory for the Pittsburgh Penguins**[2][3][5]. Sidney Crosby scored the game-winning power-play goal at 1:16 of overtime, assisted by Erik Karlsson[2][3]. This result occurred despite pre-game predictions favoring Ottawa[1][4][6][8], with Pittsburgh snapping a three-game losing streak[2][5].\n\n**Key details confirming the outcome:**\n- The game was played as scheduled, with no postponement or cancellation[2][3][5].\n- Pittsburgh's Tristan Jarry recorded a 31-save shutout, while Ottawa's Anton Forsberg made 34 saves[3][5].\n- The Senators earned a \"loser point\" for reaching overtime but lost the game[3][5].\n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Penguins\"** (p1) as the winning team. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (NHL game between the Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins on March 30, 2025) and verifies the outcome using reliable sources. The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. The outcome of the game (Pittsburgh Penguins winning in overtime) is verified with multiple sources, which aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources. It checks the date to confirm the event is in the past and then proceeds to verify the outcome. The response includes details about the game, such as the score, key players, and the fact that the game was decided in overtime, which are relevant to confirming the outcome and ensuring completeness.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is not based on a single source. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Penguins\" (p1) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt and does not include irrelevant or unverified information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
