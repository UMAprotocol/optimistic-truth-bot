The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Delhi Capitals (DC) vs Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) IPL match scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 6:00 AM ET. The resolution conditions are: p1 for Hyderabad (SRH win), p2 for Delhi (DC win), and p3 if the game isn't completed by April 5. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the match date. So the game has already occurred. Now, I need to determine the result using the search results provided.\n\nLooking through the search results, several sources ([2], [5], [6], [7], [13]) mention the March 30 match between DC and SRH. For example, result [5] states that Delhi Capitals won by seven wickets, and [7] confirms Mitchell Starc's five-wicket haul leading DC to victory. Additionally, [13] details the turning point where DC chased down 163 runs comfortably. All these sources consistently report DC's win. \n\nSince the match was completed before April 5 and DC won, the resolution should be p2 (Delhi). There's no mention of the match being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for resolving to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Delhi Capitals defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in their IPL 2025 match on March 30, 2025. Mitchell Starc's five-wicket haul (5/35) restricted SRH to 163 runs, while Faf du Plessis' 50 off 27 balls anchored DC's chase, completed in 16 overs[5][7][13]. The match concluded decisively before April 5, 2025, with no indications of postponement or cancellation[2][5][6].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the query based on the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Delhi Capitals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad IPL match on March 30, 2025) and verifies that the event has occurred by referencing the current date provided (March 31, 2025). The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the match, which is that Delhi Capitals won. This aligns with the resolution condition p2 for a Delhi win. The response adheres strictly to the instructions by not predicting or assuming but rather confirming through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly concludes that since the match was completed and Delhi won, the resolution should be p2. There is no mention of postponement or cancellation, and the match was completed before the April 5, 2025 deadline, making p3 (50-50 resolution) irrelevant.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable and not based on a single source. The recommendation to resolve as p2 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response does not assume or infer but relies on concrete evidence from the sources cited.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts verified and the conditions set out in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event using multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt conditions without any errors or bias.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, providing a well-reasoned and fact-based resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409427 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:23:47 UTC"
