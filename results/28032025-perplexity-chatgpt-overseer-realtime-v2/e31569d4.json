        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ethereum (ETH) closed above $2,000 on March 28, 2025, based on the Binance ETHUSDT 1-minute candle at 12:00 ET (noon). The resolution depends on the \"Close\" price at that specific time. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of ETH's price on March 28. Let's go through the sources one by one. \n\nLooking at result [15], it states that on March 28 at 00:06 AM UTC, ETH dropped below 2,000 USDT to 1,997.29. But that's early in the day, not the noon ET time specified. \n\nResult [16] mentions ETH dropping below 1,900 USDT at 11:26 AM UTC on March 28, trading at 1,883.02. Since UTC is 4 hours ahead of ET (assuming ET is UTC-4), 11:26 AM UTC would be 7:26 AM ET. Still not the noon ET time. \n\nResult [11] from March 29 discusses the price on March 30, which is after the date in question, so not relevant here. \n\nResult [12] talks about liquidations on March 28 but doesn't specify the exact noon ET price. \n\nResult [9] is a Polymarket question about whether the close on March 28 noon ET is higher than March 27. However, the answer isn't directly provided in the search results. \n\nResult [10] is another market prediction asking if ETH is above $2,000 on March 28 at 17:00 UTC, which translates to 1:00 PM ET. The close price there was below 2,000, but that's a different time. \n\nResult [16] shows ETH at 1,883.02 at 11:26 AM UTC (7:26 AM ET), and there's no later data in the results. Since the user's query is about 12:00 ET (noon), which is 16:00 UTC, I need to check if any source mentions the price at that exact time. \n\nThe search results don't have a direct mention of the 16:00 UTC (noon ET) price on March 28. However, result [16] indicates that by 11:26 AM UTC, ETH was already below 1,900, and there's no subsequent data showing a recovery above 2,000 later that day. Additionally, result [15] shows ETH below 2,000 early in the day, and result [16] confirms a further drop. \n\nGiven the absence of any data indicating a rebound above $2,000 by noon ET (16:00 UTC) on March 28, and the available data showing prices well below that level both before and after the specified time, it's reasonable to conclude that the close price at the specified time was below $2,000. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No,\" corresponding to p2 in the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nThe market in question resolves to \"Yes\" if the Binance ETHUSDT 1-minute candle closing price at **12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) on March 28, 2025**, was $2,000.01 or higher. Based on the provided data:\n\n- **March 28, 00:06 UTC**: ETH dropped below $2,000 to **$1,997.29** [15].  \n- **March 28, 11:26 UTC**: ETH fell further to **$1,883.02** [16].  \n- No subsequent recovery above $2,000 is documented in the search results for March 28.  \n\nSince the price remained below $2,000 throughout the day and no data indicates a rebound to $2,000.01 or higher by 16:00 UTC (12:00 ET), the resolution is **\"No\"**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the Ethereum price on Binance at a specific time and date appears to be well-reasoned and adheres closely to the instructions provided in the system prompt. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately follows the user prompt's requirement to determine if Ethereum's price was above $2,000 at noon ET on March 28, 2025, based on the Binance ETHUSDT 1-minute candle. The AI correctly identifies and uses the specified source (Binance) and timeframe (1-minute candle at 12:00 ET).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It examines available data points before and after the specified time to infer the price trend. Although it does not find a direct data point at the exact required time, it uses surrounding data points to make a reasoned inference that the price did not recover to $2,000 or above, thus leading to a conclusion that aligns with the observed price trend.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p2) is based on the absence of evidence showing that the price reached or exceeded $2,000.01 at the specified time. This conclusion is consistent with the data provided and the logical inference made from the trend observed in the data points.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI strictly adheres to the data from the specified source and timeframe. However, it is important to note that the AI does not have a direct data point at the exact minute required; instead, it relies on the trend observed in the data points before and after the event. This approach is reasonable given the constraints but is worth noting as a limitation of the available data.\n\nDecision:\nGiven the thorough analysis and adherence to the prompt requirements, and considering the logical use of available data to infer the most probable outcome, the response is satisfactory. The AI has effectively used the information at its disposal to arrive at a reasoned conclusion that aligns with the user prompt's conditions and the data observed.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately follows the user prompt's instructions, uses the specified source correctly, and logically infers the most probable outcome based on the available data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-reasoned and adheres closely to the system prompt instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412229 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:10:29 UTC",
