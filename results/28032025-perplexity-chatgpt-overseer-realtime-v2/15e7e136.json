The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Yankees on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Yankees, p2 is Brewers, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 29. The current date is March 29, 2025, 8:17 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 1:05 PM ET, which is 5:05 PM UTC. Since the current time is past that, the game should have started and possibly finished.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources report the game took place. For example, source [1] from CBS News details the Yankees hitting multiple home runs off Nestor Cortes, including three on the first three pitches. Source [11] from NBC Sports mentions Aaron Judge's three homers and the Yankees' 16-4 lead. Source [17] from the Associated Press via AJC confirms the Yankees' 18-6 victory with Judge's performance.\n\nThe official outcome as per MLB rules is crucial. The box score in source [16] (ESPN) shows the Yankees won, though the exact score isn't listed, but other articles state the Yankees won decisively. Since the game was completed and the Yankees are the clear winners according to multiple reputable sources, the resolution should be p1.\n\nI also need to ensure there's no indication the game was postponed, suspended, or ended in a tie. All sources refer to the game happening on March 29 with a completed outcome. Therefore, the market resolves to p1 for the Yankees.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Yankees defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the MLB game played on March 29, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the Yankees' dominant performance, including a historic first inning where they hit home runs on the first three pitches from Brewers pitcher Nestor Cortes[1][7][11]. Aaron Judge led the offensive surge with three home runs, including a grand slam, contributing to a final score of 18-6 in favor of the Yankees[11][17]. The game was completed and officially recorded by MLB, with no indications of postponement, suspension, or tie. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743279303 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 20:15:03 UTC",
