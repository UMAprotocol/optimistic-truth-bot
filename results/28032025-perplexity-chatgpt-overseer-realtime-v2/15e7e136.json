        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MLB game between the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Yankees on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Yankees, p2 is Brewers, and p3 is 50-50 if the game is postponed, canceled, or not completed. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 29, 2025. Sources [1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12] all confirm the game was played. So no postponement or cancellation here.\n\nNext, determine the official winner. Multiple sources report the Yankees won. For example, [1] states the Yankees won 20-9, [7] and [12] also confirm the Yankees' victory with a score of 20-9. The Brewers' pitcher Nestor Cortes struggled, and the Yankees set a franchise record with nine home runs. \n\nThe game wasn't suspended; it was completed on the same day. The final score from the box score in [6] and the recap in [12] both show the Yankees won decisively. There's no mention of the game being called early or ending in a tie. \n\nSince the game was completed officially with the Yankees as the winner, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. All conditions are met for p1: the game was played, completed, and the Yankees won. No need for p3 here. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all sources align. The Brewers' loss is consistently reported. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Yankees defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 20-9 on March 29, 2025, in a game that set multiple franchise and MLB records[1][7][12]. The Yankees established a new team record with nine home runs, becoming the third team in MLB history to achieve this feat[1][2][7]. Aaron Judge led the offensive explosion with three home runs (including a grand slam) and a career-high eight RBIs[7][12], while newcomers Paul Goldschmidt and Cody Bellinger contributed to a historic first-inning sequence where the Yankees homered on the first three pitches thrown by former Yankee Nestor Cortes[7][9][12].\n\nKey highlights:\n- **Historic start**: Goldschmidt, Bellinger, and Judge hit back-to-back-to-back homers on Cortes' first three pitches, marking the first time in MLB history a team homered on three consecutive pitches to start a game[7][12].\n- **Record-breaking offense**: Seven different Yankees homered, including Anthony Volpe (3-run HR), Jazz Chisholm Jr., and Oswald Peraza[1][2][7].\n- **Pitching struggles**: Brewers starter Nestor Cortes allowed 8 ER in 2 IP in his Milwaukee debut, while Yankees starter Max Fried gave up 6 ER (2 earned) in 4.2 IP[9][12].\n\nThe game was completed on schedule with no postponements or suspensions[1][12]. According to MLB's official records and the resolution conditions specified, the market should resolve to **p1** (Yankees win).\n\nrecommendation: p1",
