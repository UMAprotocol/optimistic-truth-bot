The ancillary data specifies that if the Timberwolves win, it's p1; Suns win is p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on the scheduled date. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 28) is in the past. That means I need to verify the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [5], [10], [11]) report that the Timberwolves won 124-109. For example, source [1] states the Timberwolves completed a four-game season sweep, and source [10] from ESPN confirms the final score. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nDevin Booker's low scoring and Edwards' return after injury are details, but the key point is the final result. All sources agree the Timberwolves won, so the resolution should be p1. No conflicting info found, so recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Phoenix Suns 124-109 in their NBA game on March 28, 2025, completing a four-game season sweep[1][2][10]. Julius Randle led the Timberwolves with 25 points, while Anthony Edwards contributed 20 points despite missing the second quarter due to an injury sustained from an inadvertent elbow by Kevin Durant[1][2][11]. The Timberwolves maintained control throughout the game, extending their winning streak against the Suns to seven games, including last year's postseason[1][10]. Phoenix\u2019s Devin Booker struggled, scoring a season-low 10 points, and the Suns\u2019 four-game winning streak was snapped[1][2][10]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is definitively verified.  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **\"Timberwolves\"** (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
