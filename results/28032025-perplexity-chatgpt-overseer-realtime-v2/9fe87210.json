        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Miami Open semifinal match between Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on who advances to the final. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 28, 2025, 8:27 PM UTC. The match was supposed to start at 3:00 PM local time in Miami, which is Eastern Time (ET). Converting that to UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 3:00 PM ET would be 7:00 PM UTC. The current time is 8:27 PM UTC, so the match should have already taken place, and the result should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match outcome. For example, source [1] states that Djokovic won their last meeting in 2023, but the preview is for the 2025 match. However, other sources like [5] and [8] provide more direct information. Source [5] from ESPN mentions that Djokovic advanced to the semifinals and will face Dimitrov, but it's dated March 28, 2025, and the article talks about the upcoming match. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, source [5] says Djokovic advanced to Friday's semifinals (March 28) and will face Dimitrov. The article is from March 28, 2025, but the match was scheduled for that day. However, the current time is 8:27 PM UTC, which is after the match's scheduled start. But the search results don't explicitly state the outcome of the March 28 match. Wait, some sources might have the result. Let me check each one carefully.\n\nLooking at source [8], it's from The Independent, dated March 28, 2025. It says Djokovic reached the semi-finals by defeating Korda, and he will play Dimitrov. But that's about the quarterfinal. The semifinal match between Djokovic and Dimitrov is what's in question here. None of the search results explicitly state the result of their March 28 semifinal match. All the sources are previews or predictions, not post-match reports. For example, source [9] and [10] are predictions, and [7] also is a preview. \n\nWait, source [1] is a preview from March 28, 2025, and mentions the match is on that day. The other sources, like [5], [8], and others, are from March 28 but don't report the result. Since the current time is 8:27 PM UTC, which is after the match's scheduled start (3:00 PM ET, which is 7:00 PM UTC), the match should have concluded. However, the provided search results don't include any post-match articles. All the sources are previews or discussions leading up to the match. \n\nGiven that the search results don't contain any information confirming the outcome of the Djokovic vs. Dimitrov semifinal match on March 28, 2025, and all the sources are from before the match, I can't definitively determine the result based on the provided information. However, the ancillary data states that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions. The head-to-head record is 12-1 in favor of Djokovic, and most predictions in the sources (like [7], [9], [10]) heavily favor Djokovic to win, some even in straight sets. \n\nSince the event date is in the past (March 28) and the current time is after the match's scheduled time, but there's no verifiable outcome in the sources, the resolution should default to the most probable outcome, which is Djokovic winning. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Djokovic\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response attempts to resolve the outcome of the Miami Open semifinal match between Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov based on the information available. The response correctly identifies the current date and time as being after the scheduled match time, which is crucial for determining the status of the event. The AI then proceeds to search for and analyze available sources to determine the match outcome.\n\nFactual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:\nThe response adheres to the instructions by checking the current time against the scheduled match time and searching for results post-match. However, it fails to find definitive post-match results from the sources it checked. The AI correctly identifies that all sources available are either previews or predictions, not actual results.\n\nLogical Reasoning and Completeness:\nThe AI's reasoning process is logical in checking the time and searching for sources post-match. However, the response assumes the most probable outcome based on past performance and predictions, which is not aligned with the requirement to base the resolution strictly on verified facts of the event's outcome. The decision to default to the most probable outcome (Djokovic winning) without concrete post-match evidence is speculative and not supported by the \"verified facts\" standard required.\n\nVerification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\nThe response does not verify the event's outcome through post-match reports or official announcements, which is a critical gap. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Djokovic\" (p1) is based on probability and past records rather than the specific event's outcome, which does not align with the instructions to use only concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nMissing Information, Bias, or Errors:\nThe main error in the response is the speculative nature of the resolution recommendation without verified post-match evidence. There is a bias towards using historical performance and predictions to infer the outcome, which is not permitted by the prompt instructions.\n\nGiven these observations, the response needs improvement to align with the requirement for factual verification of the event's outcome. The speculative nature of the conclusion based on probabilities rather than concrete post-match facts makes the response unsatisfactory.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to provide a resolution based on verified post-match facts as required. It instead uses speculative reasoning based on probabilities and past performance, which is not in line with the instructions to use only verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response needs to focus on obtaining and verifying post-match results from reliable sources specified in the user prompt. The speculative conclusion based on historical performance and predictions should be avoided.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please ensure that the resolution is based strictly on post-match results from reliable sources.

        "attempt": 2,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Djokovic vs. Dimitrov semifinal match at the Miami Open. The ancillary data specifies that if Djokovic wins, it's p1; if Dimitrov wins, p2; and if there's a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond April 28, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). The current date is March 28, 2025, and the match was scheduled for 3:00 PM ET today.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. Since the current time is 8:30 PM UTC on March 28, which is 4:30 PM ET (since UTC is 4 hours ahead of ET in March), the match was supposed to start at 3:00 PM ET. So it's already past the scheduled time. Now, I need to look through the search results to find the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, most sources are previews or predictions before the match. However, some sources might have post-match information. Let's check each one:\n\n[1] The first result is a preview from March 28, mentioning the match is scheduled for 3:00 PM ET. No result here.\n\n[4] ESPN's article from March 28 says Djokovic advanced to the semifinals and will face Dimitrov. But this is about his quarterfinal win, not the semifinal result.\n\n[5] Talks about Djokovic's historic age milestone reaching the semifinal, but again, no result of the semifinal.\n\n[7] The Independent's article from March 28 reports Djokovic's quarterfinal win and that he will play Dimitrov in the semifinal. Still no result.\n\n[9] Motorcyclesports.net's article from March 28 is a preview, discussing the upcoming semifinal.\n\n[10] Khelnow's article from March 28 is a preview, noting the match is on March 29. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the user's query says March 28, but some sources mention March 29. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, looking at [3], the match was scheduled for March 28, 3:00 PM local time (Miami), which is ET. However, [10] mentions the match is on March 29 at 12:30 AM, which might be a time zone difference. Wait, Miami is ET, so March 28, 3:00 PM ET would be March 28, 8:00 PM UTC. The current timestamp is March 28, 8:30 PM UTC, so the match should have just concluded. However, none of the search results provide the actual outcome. All the sources are previews or predictions, not post-match reports. \n\nWait, the latest search result is [7], which is from The Independent, published March 28, 2025, and it says Djokovic reached the semifinals with a win over Korda, but the semifinal against Dimitrov is yet to happen. Similarly, [4] from ESPN also mentions Djokovic advancing to the semifinal to face Dimitrov, but no result given.\n\nSince all the provided search results are from March 28 and are previews, and the current time is March 28, 8:30 PM UTC (4:30 PM ET), the match would have just started or recently concluded. However, none of the sources report the result. Therefore, there's no verifiable post-match information available in the provided search results. \n\nAccording to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data says p1 is Djokovic, p2 Dimitrov. The H2H is 12-1 in favor of Djokovic, and all previews predict Djokovic as the favorite. However, without confirmed post-match results, the resolution should default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, default to p4. Wait, the instructions state: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nBut the current timestamp is March 28, 8:30 PM UTC, and the match was scheduled for March 28, 3:00 PM ET (which is 19:00 UTC). So the match time in UTC would be 19:00, and the current time is 20:30 UTC, meaning the match should have concluded. However, the search results don't include any post-match reports. Therefore, according to the rules, since the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is available, we assume the most probable outcome, which is Djokovic (p1). However, the user's additional guidance says: \"If no post-match information is available, default to p4.\" Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in this case, the event just happened, and the sources don't have the result. Since the user provided sources up to March 28 but none report the outcome, we can't confirm the result. Therefore, the correct resolution would be p4. However, the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But the problem is that the sources don't confirm the result. So, without post-match data, we can't confirm, so it's p4. But the user's previous response was told to avoid speculation and focus on verified results. Since there are no verified results in the sources, the recommendation should be p4.\n</think>\n\nThe Miami Open Men's Singles semifinal between Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov was scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. As of the current timestamp (March 28, 2025, 8:30 PM UTC), the match has concluded, but **no verifiable post-match results confirming the outcome are available in the provided search results**. All sources discuss pre-match analysis, historical head-to-head records (Djokovic leads 12-1), and predictions favoring Djokovic[1][2][4][6][12][13]. However, these do not constitute verified post-event reporting.\n\nPer the resolution guidelines, if no official or credible reporting confirms the outcome after the event date, the recommendation defaults to **p4** (unresolved). While Djokovic was heavily favored, the absence of conclusive evidence from primary sources like the Miami Open\u2019s official channels or post-match reports necessitates this outcome.\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Miami Open Men's Singles semifinal between Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov) and the scheduled time. It adheres to the instructions by not predicting outcomes based on historical data or speculation but instead focusing on finding verified post-match results. The response correctly concludes that no verifiable post-match results are available as of the current timestamp.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a thorough search through available sources, correctly identifying that all sources are either previews or discuss the match in a future tense without providing a result. The reasoning process is detailed and checks multiple sources to confirm the absence of results, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event has occurred past its scheduled time but lacks post-match results from reliable sources. It aligns with the ancillary data and user prompt conditions by recommending p4 (unresolved) due to the absence of verified outcomes, which is consistent with the guidelines provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not assume outcomes based on predictions or historical performance, which was a flaw in the previous response. It strictly adheres to searching for verified outcomes.\n\nGiven the detailed search and adherence to the guidelines, the response is satisfactory. However, according to the critical rule for first attempt p4 recommendations, a retry is mandatory.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743193517 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-28 20:25:17 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease ensure that the resolution is based strictly on post-match results from reliable sources.
