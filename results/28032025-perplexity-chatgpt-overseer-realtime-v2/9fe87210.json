The ancillary data specifies that if Djokovic advances, it resolves to p1 (Djokovic), p2 for Dimitrov, and p3 if there's a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond April 28, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The match was scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the event has already occurred. That means I don't have to consider future dates or delays beyond April 28, which is a month later. Since the event is in the past, the outcome should be determined based on the results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [13]) report that Djokovic defeated Dimitrov in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. The match took place as scheduled on March 28, and there's no mention of any cancellation or delay. All sources confirm Djokovic's victory, so the result is clear. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that p1 corresponds to Djokovic advancing. Since all credible sources confirm his win, the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information or uncertainty here. The user's primary source is the Miami Open website, and while I don't have a direct link to their official statement, the consensus across multiple reputable tennis news outlets and sports websites like ESPN, ATP Tour, and others all corroborate the result. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nNovak Djokovic defeated Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets (6-2, 6-3) during their Miami Open men's singles semifinal match on March 28, 2025. The match concluded in 70 minutes with Djokovic dominating through strong serving (87% first-serve accuracy) and consistent baseline play, committing only five unforced errors compared to Dimitrov's 32[1][3][5][7][10]. This victory advanced Djokovic to his eighth Miami Open final, where he would eventually pursue his 100th career title[6][9]. The result was confirmed by multiple credible sources including official tournament coverage and major sports outlets, with no reports of match delays, cancellations, or unresolved disputes about the outcome[13].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Miami Open semifinal between Djokovic and Dimitrov) and the specific conditions under which the market should resolve (p1 for Djokovic advancing, p2 for Dimitrov, and p3 for other unresolved outcomes). The response accurately states that the event occurred on March 28, 2025, and that Djokovic won, which matches the user prompt's conditions for resolving to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event has occurred. It then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple credible sources, which is a robust approach to ensure accuracy. The response also correctly ignores any potential for a tie, cancellation, or delay as the event has already occurred and was completed as scheduled.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not directly cite the Miami Open's official website but mentions a consensus across reputable sources, which include major sports outlets. This approach is acceptable given the broad agreement among sources about the outcome. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Djokovic advancing) is directly aligned with the verified facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or significant biases in the response. The response could be improved by including a direct citation or confirmation from the Miami Open's official website, as specified in the user prompt. However, the use of multiple credible sources to confirm the outcome compensates for this slight deviation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the prompt. The decision to resolve the market as p1 is well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the event, verifies the outcome using multiple credible sources, and aligns the recommendation with the facts and conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response could be improved by including a direct citation from the Miami Open's official website.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411415 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:56:55 UTC",
