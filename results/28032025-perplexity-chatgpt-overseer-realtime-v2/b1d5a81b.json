If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Thunder win, it's p1; if the Pacers win, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 30, 2025, 2:20 AM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 29 at 8:00 PM ET, which is March 30, 12:00 AM UTC. So the game has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game's outcome. Source [4] from sportskeeda.com provides a detailed box score and stats, indicating the Thunder led 61-49 at halftime. However, it's labeled as \"Editor's Note: Updates will follow,\" which might mean the final result isn't there. \n\nSource [10] from newson6.com mentions that OKC needed a win to pass a franchise record, but doesn't give the final score. Source [2] from heartland-sports.com talks about the Thunder's 8-game winning streak going into the game but doesn't state the result. \n\nWait, source [4] is from March 30, 2025, and says the Pacers kept up with the Thunder 29-27 in the first quarter but then the Thunder led 61-49 at halftime. The article's title mentions \"Player Stats and Box Score for Mar. 29, 2025,\" but the content doesn't show the final score. However, source [12] from foxsports.com has a box score dated March 29, 2025, but the URL says 2024, which might be a typo. The box score there shows the Thunder as the home team with a 1st place standing, but the actual game result isn't clear.\n\nLooking at source [3], dimers.com predicted a Thunder win with a 76% probability, but that's a prediction before the game. Source [5] from foxsports1360.iheart.com also predicted a Thunder win. However, these are pre-game predictions, not actual results.\n\nSource [7], mykhel.com, mentions the Thunder's injury report but doesn't provide the game result. Source [10] from newson6.com discusses the Pacers' previous game but not the outcome against the Thunder. \n\nWait, source [4] from sportskeeda.com is titled \"Indiana Pacers vs OKC Thunder Player Stats and Box Score for Mar. 29, 2025\" and was published on March 30, 2025. The article's content describes the game up to halftime with the Thunder leading 61-49. However, the article ends with \"Editor's Note: Updates will follow,\" suggesting the full game details weren't available at the time of writing. \n\nSince the current date is March 30, 2025, 2:20 AM UTC, the game would have concluded by then (8 PM ET on March 29 is 12 AM UTC on March 30). But none of the provided sources explicitly state the final result. However, source [2] mentions that the Thunder had an 8-game winning streak going into this game and were playing at home. Source [10] notes that the Thunder were aiming to set a franchise record with a win, which would require 62 wins, but their record was 61-12 before the game. If they won, their record would be 62-12. \n\nLooking at source [8], wikihoops.com's box score for March 29, 2025, lists the Thunder's record as 61-12 before the game. If they won, it would be 62-12, but the post-game record isn't updated there. \n\nSince none of the sources provide the final score, but the Thunder were heavily favored and on a winning streak, and the game was at home, it's possible they won. However, without explicit confirmation from the sources, I can't be certain. The instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Thunder were predicted to win by multiple sources, so the recommendation would be p1 (Thunder). But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Thunder were the heavy favorites and at home, the resolution would be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET has concluded. Based on the available information:\n\n- The Thunder entered the game with a **61-12 record** and an **8-game winning streak**, having already secured the top seed in the Western Conference[2][7][10].  \n- Pre-game predictions heavily favored Oklahoma City, with models giving them a **76% chance of winning** and projected scores like **121-113** or **122-107**[3][5].  \n- The Thunder\u2019s dominant home record (**31-5**) and defensive efficiency further supported their status as favorites[6][7].  \n- While no source explicitly states the final score, the Thunder\u2019s historical performance, incentives to maintain momentum for the playoffs, and pre-game analysis strongly indicate a **Thunder victory**.  \n\nGiven the event date has passed and no verifiable evidence contradicts the expected outcome, the resolution aligns with the most probable result based on pre-game conditions and ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
