The game was scheduled for March 29, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the game's outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [8], [10]) report that the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers with a score of 132-111. For example, source [1] states, \"The Thunder defeated the Pacers, 132-111 tonight in Oklahoma City.\" Similarly, source [10] from ABC News confirms the same score and outcome. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports indicate the game was played as scheduled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since the Thunder won, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in the query matches the sources. The date and teams align with the search results, so there's no confusion with another game. All evidence points to a Thunder victory without any issues affecting the game's completion. Thus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers 132-111 in their NBA game on March 29, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the Thunder's victory, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leading the team with 33 points, 8 assists, and 7 rebounds[1][2][5][8][10]. The game was played as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, and the final score reflects a decisive win for Oklahoma City[3][4][6].\n\n**Key Details:**\n- **Final Score:** Thunder 132, Pacers 111[1][8][10]\n- **Thunder Performance:** Shot 51.1% from the field, with Lu Dort adding 22 points (6/7 from three-point range)[5][8]\n- **Game Context:** Part of OKC's nine-game winning streak, extending their league-best record to 62-12[4][5]\n\nSince the Thunder won decisively and the game was completed as scheduled, the market resolves to **p1** (Thunder). \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the requirement of verifying the outcome of the Pacers vs. Thunder game scheduled for March 29, 2025, and correctly identifies that the game has already occurred by the current timestamp of March 31, 2025. The AI has verified through multiple sources that the Oklahoma City Thunder won the game, which aligns with the resolution condition p1 for a Thunder win.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it checks the current date against the date of the event, confirms the event has occurred, and then proceeds to verify the outcome through reliable sources. The response also correctly ignores any possibilities of the game being postponed or canceled since there is no evidence to suggest such occurrences. This adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt ensures that the resolution recommendation is based on the exact event and its verifiable outcomes.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, which strengthens the reliability of the information. The response also correctly matches the event details (teams involved and date) with the sources cited, ensuring that there is no confusion with a similar but different event.\n\nThe response is complete as it provides a detailed account of the game's outcome, including the final score and key performances, which further supports the resolution recommendation. There is no missing information that would be critical for resolving the market based on the user prompt's conditions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently to resolve the market.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
