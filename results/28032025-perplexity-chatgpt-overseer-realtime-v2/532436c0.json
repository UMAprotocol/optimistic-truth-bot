        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MarQuel Mederos vs. Austin Hubbard fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The current date is March 29, 2025, 8:45 PM UTC, which is after the event's scheduled time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the fight has already happened. The search results mention the event took place on March 29, 2025. Looking at source [12], the live fight coverage shows the bout between Mederos and Hubbard as part of the prelims, which were in progress. However, the detailed stats from that source indicate the fight might have concluded, but the results aren't explicitly stated there. \n\nNext, source [13] lists the event results but doesn't specify the outcome of Mederos vs. Hubbard. Other sources like [1], [6], and [9] provide predictions and previews, all leaning towards Mederos winning, either by decision or KO/TKO. However, predictions don't count as actual results. \n\nSource [5] mentions the prelim results but doesn't list the winner. Source [7] is the official UFC page for the event, but it only shows the fight card without results. Source [8] has the official scorecards, but again, no specific mention of Mederos vs. Hubbard's outcome. \n\nSince the user's current time is after the event, but none of the provided sources explicitly state the fight's result, I need to check if there's any mention of the outcome. Source [12] provides live stats showing Mederos landed 36 significant strikes out of 61, while Hubbard landed 19 out of 56. Mederos also had more control time, but without a clear announcement of the winner, it's hard to determine. \n\nGiven the resolution conditions, if the fight isn't scored or there's no credible reporting, it would resolve to p3 (50-50). However, the user's ancillary data says the resolution source is ESPN or credible reporting. Since none of the provided sources (including ESPN via source [3] and [12]) confirm the result, and the fight date has passed, it's possible the result isn't yet reported in the sources provided. \n\nBut wait, source [12] is from ESPN and shows the fight as part of the prelims. The stats there might indicate the fight went the distance, but without a decision announcement, it's unclear. Since the user's timestamp is after the event, but the available sources don't confirm the winner, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) due to lack of verifiable information. However, considering the live stats from ESPN in source [12], Mederos might have won based on significant strikes and control time. But without an explicit result, it's risky to assume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a source. Let me check again. Source [5] mentions prelim results but doesn't list the winner. Source [13] also doesn't include the result. Since all provided sources don't explicitly state the outcome, despite the event date being past, the resolution should be p3. However, the user's personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions heavily favor Mederos, but predictions aren't results. \n\nWait, the personalization rules state: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Here, the ancillary data's resolution conditions have p2 as Mederos. If the event date is past and no info is available, we should default to the most probable outcome, which is Mederos (p2). However, the user's instructions also say if the event is in the past but no info, and the prompt doesn't mention postponement, resolve based on probable outcome. \n\nBut the problem is that the sources provided don't have the actual result. The fight happened, but the results aren't listed. In real-time, the fight might have happened, but without explicit confirmation, it's uncertain. However, the user's current time is after the event, so the fight should have occurred. Since the sources don't report the result, but the resolution source is ESPN, and source [12] is ESPN's fight center, which shows the fight stats but not the winner, it's unclear. \n\nIn this case, following the personalization rules, since the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found in the sources, we should resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the user's ancillary data, which is Mederos (p2). However, the instructions also mention that if the event is in the past but no info, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions all point to Mederos winning, so despite the lack of explicit result, the resolution would be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe bout between MarQuel Mederos and Austin Hubbard at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025, has concluded. Based on the available data:  \n\n- **Fight Context**: Mederos entered the fight on a seven-win streak, including a UFC debut victory over Landon Quinones[1][6]. Hubbard, a UFC veteran, had a mixed record (4-6 in the UFC) and was coming off a split-decision loss to Alexander Hernandez[2][11].  \n- **Live Stats**: Per ESPN\u2019s fight center coverage, Mederos outperformed Hubbard in significant strikes (36/61 vs. 19/56) and controlled the pace despite Hubbard\u2019s grappling attempts[12].  \n- **Predictions**: Pre-fight analyses heavily favored Mederos, citing his momentum, striking accuracy, and durability[1][6][9].  \n\n**Resolution**: No explicit result is documented in the provided sources, but the statistical edge and pre-fight projections align with Mederos as the likely winner.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response attempts to resolve the market based on the outcome of the MarQuel Mederos vs. Austin Hubbard fight at UFC Fight Night. The response navigates through various sources, analyzing the available data to determine the outcome of the fight. However, there are several critical points to consider in evaluating the response:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the fight has occurred on the date in question and attempts to gather information from various sources. However, it struggles with a definitive resolution due to the lack of explicit reporting on the winner. The response eventually leans towards resolving as p2 (Mederos wins) based on statistical performance and pre-fight predictions, which is not entirely in line with the instructions that emphasize reliance on concrete, verified outcomes rather than predictions or probable outcomes.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a thorough search and logical reasoning process, considering multiple sources and the lack of explicit results. However, it incorrectly shifts from a potential p3 resolution (50-50 due to lack of clear information) to a p2 resolution based on probabilities and predictions, which contradicts the requirement for verified facts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place but fails to find a verified outcome. The decision to recommend p2 based on statistical data and predictions rather than a confirmed result does not align with the strict factual requirements of the system prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response shows a bias towards predictions and statistical performance rather than sticking strictly to verified outcomes. There is an error in judgment by assuming the winner based on fight statistics and momentum rather than waiting for or finding a confirmed source stating the result.\n\nGiven these points, the response does not fully adhere to the instructions that require resolutions based strictly on verified facts. The logical leap to resolve based on probabilities and incomplete information leads to a recommendation that might not be reliable.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to adhere strictly to the requirement for verified outcomes, instead using predictions and statistical data to infer a winner, which is not supported by explicit, verified results as required.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should focus more on finding verified sources explicitly stating the fight's outcome.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the MarQuel Mederos vs. Austin Hubbard fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Mederos wins, it's p2; if Hubbard wins, p1; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 29, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The given current date is March 29, 2025, 8:46 PM UTC, which is the same day as the event. The fight was scheduled for March 29, so it's already taken place. The next step is to verify the actual result using the provided search results.\n\nLooking through the search results, several sources mention the fight. Source [3] and [9] (which seems to be a duplicate) provide detailed round-by-round updates and the official result: Marquel Mederos defeated Austin Hubbard by split decision (28-29, 29-28, 29-28). This is a clear indication that Mederos was declared the winner. \n\nOther sources like [1] and [11] had predictions favoring Mederos, but the key here is the actual result reported in [3] and [9]. The official UFC scorecards in [13] might also confirm this, but the exact details aren't shown. However, the live results from [3] and [9] are sufficient as they directly state the outcome. \n\nSince the event has occurred and the result is verified by multiple credible sources (F4WOnline and Combat Press), the resolution should be p2 as per the ancillary data. There's no mention of the fight being a draw or unresolved, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nMarQuel Mederos defeated Austin Hubbard by split decision (28-29, 29-28, 29-28) in their lightweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025[3][9]. The official result confirms Mederos as the winner, with two judges scoring the fight 29-28 in his favor against one dissenting scorecard for Hubbard[3][9]. This outcome aligns with pre-fight predictions that highlighted Mederos' momentum and striking advantages[1][12], though Hubbard's durability extended the fight to a decision[3][9].\n\n**Key fight details**:\n- Mederos controlled early rounds with leg kicks and striking volume[3][9]\n- Hubbard secured back control in Round 2 but couldn't finish submissions[3][9]\n- Final round saw Mederos regain control with ground strikes and effective scrambling[3][9]\n\nThe resolution source ESPN and multiple MMA news outlets corroborate Mederos' victory[3][6][9]. As per the market conditions, this outcome triggers resolution to \"Mederos\" (p2).\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
