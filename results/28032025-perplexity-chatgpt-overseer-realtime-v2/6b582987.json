The ancillary data specifies that if the Blues win, it's p2 (Blues), if the Avalanche win, p1 (Avalanche), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the date. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game has already happened. The next step is to look through the search results to find out who won. \n\nLooking at the sources, result [2] from Plain Text Sports shows the final score as Blues 2, Avalanche 1. The box score confirms this with goals by Buchnevich and Bolduc for the Blues, and MacKinnon for the Avalanche. \n\nResult [3] is a YouTube video titled \"NHL Highlights | Blues vs. Avalanche - March 29, 2025\" which mentions the Blues extending their win streak to nine games with a 2-1 victory. Similarly, result [9] from TSN and [10] from CBS Sports both state the Blues won 2-1, extending their streak to nine games. \n\nResult [4] from Colorado Hockey Now also confirms the Avalanche's 11-game home winning streak was stopped by the Blues' 2-1 win. The game summary in [10] again reiterates the Blues' victory with Binnington making 28 saves. \n\nAll credible sources consistently report the Blues won the game 2-1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Blues).\n</think>\n\nThe St. Louis Blues defeated the Colorado Avalanche 2-1 in their NHL game on March 29, 2025, extending their winning streak to nine games. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Final Score**: Blues 2, Avalanche 1[2][3][9][10]  \n- **Game-Winning Goal**: Pavel Buchnevich scored the decisive goal at 11:06 of the third period[2][9].  \n- **Goaltending**: Jordan Binnington made 28 saves for the Blues, while Mackenzie Blackwood stopped 19 shots for the Avalanche[3][9].  \n- **Streaks**: The Blues extended their NHL-longest active win streak, while the Avalanche\u2019s 11-game home win streak at Ball Arena was snapped[4][9].  \n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was definitively determined.  \n\n**recommendation: p2**",

The response effectively verifies the outcome of the NHL game between the St. Louis Blues and the Colorado Avalanche, which took place on March 29, 2025, and confirms that the St. Louis Blues won the game with a score of 2-1. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a win by the Blues should result in a resolution of p2.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the current date against the date of the event to confirm that the game has already occurred. It then proceeds to gather evidence from multiple credible sources, including sports news websites and a YouTube video, all of which consistently report the same outcome. The response also confirms that there was no postponement or cancellation of the game, which matches the conditions specified for resolution.\n\nThe recommendation of p2 is directly aligned with the definitions provided in the ancillary data, where p2 corresponds to a win by the Blues. The response also adheres to the instruction to report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring the reliability of the information. The response also correctly ignores any potential outcomes that were not realized, such as postponement or cancellation, as there was no evidence to suggest such occurrences.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple credible sources to confirm the event's outcome and provided a clear and accurate recommendation based on the verified facts.\"\n}\n```",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411872 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:04:32 UTC"
