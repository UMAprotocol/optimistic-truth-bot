        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Bruins vs. Red Wings game on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Bruins win, it's p2; if the Red Wings win, p1. If postponed, it stays open, and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 29, 2025, which is two days before the current date of March 31, 2025. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [6], [7], [8]) report that the Detroit Red Wings won the game 2-1 against the Boston Bruins. For example, source [1] states, \"Lucas Raymond and Marco Kasper scored, Cam Talbot stopped 21 shots and the Detroit Red Wings beat the Boston Bruins 2-1 on Saturday night.\" This is corroborated by other sources like CBS Sports and Detroit Hockey Now, which also mention the 2-1 victory for the Red Wings. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports confirm the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution should be based on the actual outcome. Since the Red Wings won, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources consistently report the Red Wings' win, so there's no ambiguity. The Bruins' loss is part of an eight-game losing streak, as noted in sources [1] and [2]. The game's key moments, like the goals by Raymond and Kasper, and Talbot's saves, are detailed across multiple articles, reinforcing the result. \n\nNo sources suggest any issues with the game's completion or any changes to the schedule. Therefore, the conditions for p3 (canceled/postponed) don't apply. The correct resolution is p1, corresponding to the Red Wings' victory.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Boston Bruins and Detroit Red Wings on March 29, 2025, concluded with a **2-1 victory for the Detroit Red Wings**[1][2][3][6][7]. Key details from verified sources confirm:\n\n- **Final score**: Detroit Red Wings 2, Boston Bruins 1  \n- **Winning team**: Detroit Red Wings secured their fourth win in 15 games[1][7]  \n- **Critical plays**: Goals by Lucas Raymond and Marco Kasper, with Cam Talbot making 21 saves including a game-sealing glove stop with 9.3 seconds remaining[1][6][7]  \n\nThe game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][2][3][6][7][8]. Per the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **p1** (Red Wings win).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
