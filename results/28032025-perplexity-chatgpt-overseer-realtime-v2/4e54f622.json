If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

The ancillary data specifies that if CSK wins, it's p2 (Chennai), RCB wins is p1 (Bangalore), and if the game isn't completed by April 3, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is March 28, 2025, 5:49 PM UTC. The match was scheduled for March 28, 10:00 AM ET, which is 2:00 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the scheduled start, the event has already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [5], [7], [8]) report that RCB won the match by 50 runs. For example, result [1] states \"RCB won by 50 runs\" and [3] mentions \"RCB crush CSK by 50 runs.\" These are consistent across different sources, confirming the outcome. \n\nNext, check if the game was completed by April 3. The match took place on March 28, well before the deadline, so the 50-50 condition doesn't apply. \n\nSince RCB (Royal Challengers Bengaluru) won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Bangalore). All sources agree on the result, so there's no ambiguity. \n\nI need to ensure that the event in the sources matches the user's query. The user refers to Royal Challengers Bangalore, which is the same as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). The sources consistently use RCB, so the team names align. \n\nNo conflicting information in the search results. All point to RCB's victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) defeated Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 50 runs in their IPL 2025 match at MA Chidambaram Stadium on March 28, 2025[1][3][5][7]. The game concluded successfully on its scheduled date with RCB posting 196/7 and restricting CSK to 146/8[3][5][8]. This outcome occurred before the April 3 deadline specified in the resolution conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event's occurrence and its outcome based on reliable sources. The match between Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore on March 28, 2025, is confirmed to have been won by Royal Challengers Bangalore. This matches the user's ancillary data where a win by Royal Challengers Bangalore corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the current date and time against the event's scheduled date and time, confirming that the event has already occurred. It then verifies the outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The response also correctly disregards the 50-50 condition since the match was completed before the April 3 deadline.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event in question matches the user's description, including the correct teams and the event's outcome. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is based solely on verified facts and adheres strictly to the user prompt and system instructions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is accurate, complete, and adheres to the required instructions.

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743184041 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-28 17:47:21 UTC"
