The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p2 (Maple Leafs), and if the Ducks win, it's p1 (Ducks). If postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game was yesterday. Now, looking at the search results to find the outcome. \n\nSearch result [2] from CBS Sports has a detailed box score and mentions the Maple Leafs won 3-2. The headline says \"Maple Leafs hold off Ducks 3-2 to increase their Atlantic lead.\" That's a clear indication of the result. \n\nAnother source, [6] from ABC30, also states the Maple Leafs won 3-2. The article's title is \"Ducks host the Maple Leafs after overtime victory,\" but the content confirms the Maple Leafs' win. \n\nAdditionally, the YouTube video in [8] titled \"NHL Highlights | Maple Leafs vs. Ducks - March 30, 2025\" likely shows the game's conclusion, and the description mentions the Maple Leafs winning. \n\nAll these sources agree that Toronto won. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2, which corresponds to the Maple Leafs winning.\n</think>\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 in their March 30, 2025 matchup at Honda Center. Steven Lorentz scored the decisive goal with 8:25 remaining in regulation, breaking a 2-2 tie after Anaheim erased Toronto's two-goal lead. Joseph Woll made 28 saves for the Maple Leafs, who improved to 44-25-4 and strengthened their Atlantic Division lead[2][6].\n\nKey game details:\n- **Final Score**: Toronto 3, Anaheim 2  \n- **Winning Goal**: Steven Lorentz (4th line forward) redirected David Kampf's pass at 11:35 of 3rd period[2]  \n- **Standings Impact**: Toronto extended division lead to 3 points over Florida/Tampa Bay[2]  \n- **Season Series**: Toronto won both meetings against Anaheim[6]  \n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, and no subsequent changes to the result have been reported. Based on the resolution conditions defined in the ancillary data, the market should resolve to **\"Maple Leafs\"** (p2) as Toronto secured a regulation victory. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
