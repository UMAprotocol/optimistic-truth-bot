The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Anaheim Ducks game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p2; if the Ducks win, p1; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 30) is in the past. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the sources, several mention the game. Source [7] from Plain Text Sports shows a final score of 3-2 in favor of the Maple Leafs. The box score there lists the goals, including Steven Lorentz and Matthew Knies scoring for Toronto. Source [6] from Pension Plan Puppets also mentions a Leafs win over the Kings the day before and notes the next game against the Ducks, but the recap in [11] and [6] refers to a 3-1 Leafs win over the Kings, not the Ducks. Wait, need to be careful here.\n\nSource [14] from ESPN lists the game with a final score of 3-2 Maple Leafs. Additionally, source [7] provides a detailed box score with goals by Toronto's Steven Lorentz and others, confirming the 3-2 result. Source [13] from the Ducks' official site previews the game, mentioning their comeback win against the Rangers but doesn't give the Leafs game result. However, the actual result is in [7] and [14]. \n\nThere's a discrepancy in some sources referring to a game against the Kings, but focusing on the March 30 date, the correct game is Maple Leafs vs. Ducks. The final score from [7] and [14] both indicate a Maple Leafs victory (3-2). No sources mention a postponement or cancellation. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 for Maple Leafs.\n</think>\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 in their NHL game on March 30, 2025, as evidenced by the final box score showing Toronto's third-period goals from Steven Lorentz and Matthew Knies[7][14]. The game occurred on schedule without postponement or cancellation, meeting all resolution conditions outlined in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

It correctly identifies a potential source of confusion with another game (Maple Leafs vs. Kings) and clarifies that the relevant game for the query is indeed the one against the Ducks. The response uses sources [7] and [14] to confirm the Maple Leafs' victory with a score of 3-2, which aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt for a Maple Leafs win (p2).\n\nThe response is complete in its verification of the event, ensuring that no postponement or cancellation was reported, which matches the conditions outlined for resolution. The recommendation of p2 is directly aligned with the definitions provided in the ancillary data, where p2 corresponds to a Maple Leafs win.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has focused strictly on the event specified in the user prompt without deviating to unrelated details or events. The sources cited are used appropriately to support the resolution recommendation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743388686 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 02:38:06 UTC"
