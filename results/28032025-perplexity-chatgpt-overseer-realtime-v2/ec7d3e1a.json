The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Vancouver Canucks vs. Columbus Blue Jackets game on March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Canucks win, it's p2 (Blue Jackets p1, Canucks p2, etc.). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was on March 28, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [7], [8], [9], [11]) report that the Blue Jackets won 7-6 in a shootout. For example, source [3] states, \"Kent Johnson scored the winning goal in a shootout, lifting the host Columbus Blue Jackets to a wild 7-6 victory over the Vancouver Canucks.\" Similarly, source [7] mentions, \"Boone Jenner had two goals, Kent Johnson had the lone score of the shootout and the Columbus Blue Jackets rallied... to beat the Vancouver Canucks 7-6.\" \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources discuss the game occurring on the scheduled date. The result was a shootout win for Columbus, so according to the resolution conditions, since the Blue Jackets won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirm the Blue Jackets' victory, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks and Columbus Blue Jackets played their scheduled NHL game on March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. After a high-scoring regulation and overtime period ending 6-6, the Blue Jackets secured a 7-6 victory in a shootout[1][3][4][7][8][11]. Key details:\n\n- Columbus overcame multiple deficits, including a 3-0 first-period hole and a 5-3 third-period disadvantage[2][4][6].\n- Boone Jenner (2 goals, 1 assist) and Dante Fabbro (1 goal, 2 assists) led Columbus' offense[4][7][11].\n- Kent Johnson scored the shootout winner while Elvis Merzlikins stopped all three Vancouver attempts in the tiebreaker[3][9][11].\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][3][7].

The AI correctly notes that the game was not postponed or canceled and that the Columbus Blue Jackets won the game in a shootout. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a Blue Jackets win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed account of the game, including the final score and key players' performances, which supports the resolution decision. The AI uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring the reliability of the information. The reasoning is logically structured, leading to a clear and justified recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verifies the event's occurrence on the scheduled date and checks multiple sources to confirm the outcome. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Blue Jackets win) is directly aligned with the verified facts and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI effectively uses the information available to make an accurate resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the required standards of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409737 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:28:57 UTC"
