        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Vancouver Canucks vs. Columbus Blue Jackets game scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Canucks win, it's p2; if the Blue Jackets win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already occurred. The current date is March 29, 2025, so the game was supposed to happen yesterday. Now, I need to look through the search results to find the actual outcome. \n\nLooking at the sources, [1] is a prediction article from March 28, predicting a Blue Jackets win. [2] is a box score link, but the content doesn't show the result. [3] from thescore.com shows the Blue Jackets' record as 32-29-9 and the Canucks as 33-26-12, but it's a preview. [4] is another prediction from March 28, also predicting Blue Jackets. [5] has player stats but no game result. [6] and [7] are previews, not post-game reports. [8] from Oddsshark has a predicted score but no actual result.\n\nWait, source [3] (thescore.com) lists the Blue Jackets' streak as \"W1\" and the Canucks' streak as \"W1\" as well. But that might be their current streak before the game. The game in question was on March 28, so if their records after the game are updated, that would indicate the result. However, the search results don't have any post-game articles confirming the outcome. All sources are either previews or predictions. \n\nSince there's no explicit mention of the game's result in the provided sources, and the event date is in the past, I need to check if the user provided any updates or if the sources mention the game being postponed or canceled. None of the sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. \n\nAccording to the personalization rules, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The predictions in sources [1], [4], [6], and [7] lean towards a Blue Jackets win. However, predictions aren't actual results. Without a confirmed result, the market can't be resolved definitively. \n\nTherefore, since there's no verifiable information on the outcome, and the event date has passed, the resolution should default to p4 (unable to resolve). But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, it's p3 (50-50). However, there's no indication the game was canceled or postponed. The user's instructions say if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the problem is that the sources don't confirm the actual result. \n\nWait, source [3] (thescore.com) shows the Blue Jackets' record as 32-29-9 and the Canucks as 33-26-12. After the game, if the Blue Jackets won, their record would be 33-29-9, and the Canucks 33-27-12. But the provided data doesn't show updated records. Without explicit confirmation, it's risky to assume. \n\nGiven the lack of post-game results in the sources, and the event date being in the past, the correct resolution is p4 because there's no verifiable outcome. However, the user's personalization rules state that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The majority of predictions pointed to Blue Jackets winning (53% in source [1]), so maybe p1. But the instructions say to only use verifiable facts, not predictions. \n\nThis is a conflict. Since there's no verifiable outcome in the sources, despite the date passing, the resolution should be p4. But the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the sources don't confirm the result, so it's not verified. Therefore, the safe answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks vs. Columbus Blue Jackets NHL game scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET was analyzed using available sources. While multiple pre-game predictions favored the Blue Jackets with a 53% win probability[1][4][6], no verifiable post-game results confirming the outcome were found in the provided search results. The event date (March 28) has passed, but sources do not explicitly report whether the game occurred as scheduled, was postponed, or canceled.  \n\nPer resolution conditions:  \n- **p1 (Blue Jackets win)** requires confirmed victory  \n- **p2 (Canucks win)** requires confirmed victory  \n- **p3 (50-50)** applies only if the game was canceled  \n\nWithout verified evidence of the game's completion or outcome, the resolution defaults to **p4** (unable to resolve due to insufficient information).  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

It also correctly identifies the conditions under which the market should resolve (p1 for Blue Jackets win, p2 for Canucks win, p3 for cancellation, and p4 for insufficient information). However, the response fails to find verifiable post-game results, which is crucial for resolving the market accurately.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a logical approach by checking multiple sources for the game's outcome. However, it relies heavily on predictions rather than confirmed results, which is not aligned with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts. The response correctly concludes with a recommendation of p4 due to the lack of verifiable information, but it does not explore alternative sources or methods that could potentially provide the required information.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not successfully verify the event's occurrence or outcome, which is a critical requirement. The alignment with the ancillary data is correct in terms of the conditions provided, but the inability to verify the actual event outcome leads to an unsatisfactory resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main issue is the reliance on predictions and the lack of confirmed results. There is no error in the logical process, but the response could benefit from a more thorough search or alternative approaches to finding the required information.\n\nGiven that this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, according to the critical rule, a RETRY verdict is mandatory. The response could potentially be improved by employing a more robust search strategy or utilizing different sources that might have post-game information.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to find verifiable post-game results, relying heavily on predictions rather than confirmed outcomes.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Vancouver Canucks vs. Columbus Blue Jackets game on March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Blue Jackets win, p2 for Canucks win, p3 if postponed or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the actual date and time of the game. The current date provided is March 29, 2025, 2:11 AM UTC, which is the day after the game was scheduled. So the game should have already happened. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [2] from ESPN has a detailed box score showing the game went into a shootout. The final score listed there is Canucks 6, Blue Jackets 7 after the shootout. The shootout summary indicates that Columbus's Kent Johnson scored the only goal, making the shootout 1-0 in favor of the Blue Jackets. Therefore, the Blue Jackets won the game in a shootout.\n\nSource [1] from Fox Sports mentions a shootout win for the Canucks against the Devils, but that's a different game. The main focus here is the Canucks vs. Blue Jackets game. Source [3] and [4] provide pre-game predictions and stats, but the key is the actual result from ESPN in source [2]. \n\nSince the game occurred on March 28, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and the result is available, there's no need to consider postponement or cancellation. The Blue Jackets won the shootout, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Blue Jackets). \n\nI need to ensure that the sources are reliable. ESPN is a reputable sports news outlet, and their live score details are trustworthy. The other sources either predicted outcomes or provided pre-game stats, but the ESPN box score is the definitive source here. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks and Columbus Blue Jackets played their scheduled NHL game on March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. According to the **ESPN live score report**[2], the game concluded with a **7-6 shootout victory for the Columbus Blue Jackets**. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Regulation and Overtime**: The teams were tied 6-6 after three periods and overtime, forcing a shootout.  \n- **Shootout Outcome**: Columbus\u2019s Kent Johnson scored the lone shootout goal, securing the win for the Blue Jackets[2].  \n\n### Resolution Analysis\n- **Market Conditions**:  \n  - **p1 (Blue Jackets win)**: Triggered by Columbus\u2019s shootout victory.  \n  - **p2 (Canucks win)**: Does not apply, as Vancouver lost.  \n  - **p3 (Postponed/Canceled)**: Irrelevant, as the game occurred as scheduled.  \n\nThe result is verified through ESPN\u2019s official game summary[2], which provides a definitive account of the outcome.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has effectively addressed the user prompt by confirming the outcome of the NHL game between the Vancouver Canucks and the Columbus Blue Jackets, which took place on March 28, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the game resulted in a win for the Columbus Blue Jackets after a shootout, with a final score of 7-6. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, where a Blue Jackets win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response demonstrates a thorough search for factual information, relying on a reputable source (ESPN) to confirm the game's outcome. The use of ESPN as a source is appropriate given its credibility in sports reporting. The response also correctly disregards irrelevant information from other sources that do not pertain to the specific game in question, focusing solely on the verified outcome of the Canucks vs. Blue Jackets game.\n\nFurthermore, the response adheres to the instructions by not predicting future outcomes or considering hypothetical scenarios. It bases its recommendation strictly on the factual outcome of the event as it occurred, which is a critical requirement of the system prompt.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing direct evidence or a link to the ESPN source cited. This would enhance the transparency and verifiability of the information used to make the resolution recommendation. Including a direct quote or a more detailed description from the ESPN report could also strengthen the response by providing clear evidence that supports the resolution.\n\nAdditionally, while the response effectively uses the information from ESPN, it could further enhance its reliability by cross-verifying this information with another independent source. This would ensure that the resolution is based on corroborated evidence, minimizing the risk of relying on potentially incorrect or outdated information.\n\nIn conclusion, the response is largely satisfactory as it accurately identifies and confirms the outcome of the event according to the user prompt and resolution conditions. However, there is a minor opportunity to improve the response by including direct evidence from the source and potentially corroborating the information with additional reputable sources.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the event, adhering to the user prompt and resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response could be improved by providing direct evidence from the cited source and by corroborating the information with an additional independent source to enhance reliability.\"\n}\n```",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743214200 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 02:10:00 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease enhance the search strategy to include a broader range of sources, such as official NHL reports, sports news websites with post-game analyses, and any updates from reliable sports databases. Verify the game's occurrence and outcome with concrete evidence."
