The key here is to verify if the event occurred and determine the outcome according to the ancillary data. \n\nFirst, I check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 29, 2025, and the current date is March 31, 2025. Since the event date is in the past, I need to confirm the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [6], [7]) report that Duke won the game 85-65. For example, source [1] states, \"No. 1-seed Duke prevailed against No. 2-seed Alabama Saturday night, winning 85-65.\" Similarly, source [6] mentions Duke's 85-65 victory and their advancement to the Final Four. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Duke wins, the resolution is p1. All credible sources confirm Duke's win, so there's no ambiguity. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nDuke defeated Alabama 85-65 in the Elite Eight NCAA Tournament game on March 29, 2025, advancing to the Final Four[1][6][7]. The Blue Devils' defense held Alabama to 35.4% shooting and 25% from three-point range, while freshman Kon Knueppel led Duke with 21 points[1][6]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions where a Duke win corresponds to **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Alabama vs. Duke basketball game. Here is a detailed evaluation of the response:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game occurred on March 29, 2025, and that the current date is March 31, 2025, which means the event is in the past and eligible for resolution. The response also accurately reports that Duke won the game with a score of 85-65, aligning with multiple sources cited. This outcome matches the user prompt's resolution condition that a Duke win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds from verifying the event date to confirming the outcome through reliable sources. It then aligns this outcome with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, leading to a clear and justified recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, which is a robust method to ensure accuracy. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the facts as verified and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and system instructions, focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the provided instructions. There is no need for a rerun or any adjustments to the prompt, as the response effectively and accurately resolves the query based on the conditions set forth.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event outcome and logically aligns this with the ancillary data to make a clear and accurate recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409561 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:26:01 UTC",
