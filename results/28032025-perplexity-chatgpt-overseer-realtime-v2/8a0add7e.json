The current date is March 29, 2025, so the game has already taken place. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game was set for March 28 at 9:39 PM ET. Since the current date is March 29, the game is in the past. Now, I need to find out the result.\n\nLooking at the sources, result [9] from On3.com states that Michigan lost to Auburn 78-65. Another source [6] from CBS Sports also lists the final score as Auburn 78, Michigan 65. Additionally, source [5] on ESPN's live score page shows the game ended with Auburn winning. \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that if Auburn wins, the market resolves to p1. Since multiple sources confirm Auburn's victory, the correct recommendation is p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources point to Auburn winning, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Michigan vs. Auburn NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 game occurred on March 28, 2025, at 9:39 PM ET as scheduled. **Auburn defeated Michigan 78-65**[9][6], advancing to the Elite Eight. The game was not postponed or canceled, with Auburn maintaining control after a pivotal 20-2 second-half run to overcome a 9-point deficit[9]. \n\nGiven the resolution conditions:\n- **Auburn's victory** directly triggers **p1** resolution.  \n- No postponement or cancellation occurred, eliminating **p3** consideration.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response uses multiple reliable sources (On3.com, CBS Sports, and ESPN) to confirm the result, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows the instructions by first verifying the occurrence and timing of the event and then confirming the outcome. It correctly applies the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt (p1 for Auburn win) based on the verified outcome of the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome accurately. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the facts verified from reliable sources and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and uses appropriate sources for verification.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
