The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Diamondbacks, p2 is Cubs, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 28. The search results mention the game on March 28, 2025, with the Cubs winning 10-6 according to sources [2][9][11][14][15]. There's also a mention of another game on March 29, but the query is specifically about March 28. \n\nNext, I need to confirm the game wasn't postponed or canceled. The detailed box scores and recaps indicate the game was played as scheduled. The official outcome from MLB, as per the resolution conditions, is crucial. The Cubs' win is well-documented across multiple sources, including ESPN and CBS Sports. \n\nSince the game was completed and the Cubs won, the resolution should be p2. There's no indication of a suspension or tie, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for resolving to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Chicago Cubs defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 10-6 in the MLB game played on March 28, 2025, at Chase Field in Phoenix[2][9][11][14][15]. The game was completed as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations, and the outcome was officially recorded by Major League Baseball. Miguel Amaya's five RBIs and Ian Happ's three RBIs powered the Cubs' offense, while Justin Steele earned the win[9][11]. The Diamondbacks' Zac Gallen took the loss[9].\n\nSince the game concluded with a Cubs victory under official MLB rules, this market resolves to **p2** (Cubs win) based on the ancillary data's resolution conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt, focusing strictly on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the winner of the game as the Chicago Cubs with a score of 10-6, which matches the user prompt's requirement to resolve based on the official outcome recorded by Major League Baseball. The response also correctly notes that the game was not postponed, canceled, or suspended, which aligns with the resolution conditions provided.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions outlined in the user prompt. It checks for postponement, cancellation, and the completion status of the game, all of which are crucial for accurate resolution. The response concludes that since the game was completed and the Cubs won, the market should resolve to p2 (Cubs win), which is a logical conclusion based on the provided ancillary data.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event through multiple sources and confirms that the game concluded with a Cubs victory. This verification process is thorough and aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt and does not introduce unrelated information or assumptions.\n\nGiven the thoroughness, accuracy, and adherence to the provided instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the event's verified outcome and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome and logically processes the conditions for resolution.
