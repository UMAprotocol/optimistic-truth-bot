        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Cleveland Guardians and Kansas City Royals on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to p1 for a Royals win, p2 for Guardians, and p3 (50-50) if the game is postponed, canceled, or ends in a tie. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 30, 2025, at 9:19 PM UTC. The game was supposed to start at 2:10 PM EDT (which is 6:10 PM UTC). Since the current time is after the scheduled start, I need to confirm whether the game was played or not.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([1], [2], [7], [10]) discuss the game on March 29, where the Royals won 4-3. However, the query is about the March 30 game. The search results include previews and predictions for the March 30 game ([3], [5], [11]), but there's no direct report of the game's outcome on March 30. \n\nWait, result [6] is a box score dated March 30, but it seems to be from the same day as the query. Let me check that. The box score shows the Guardians vs. Royals game on March 30, 2025, with player stats. However, the detailed play-by-play isn't clear. The video highlights in [7] and [9] are from March 29 and March 27, respectively. \n\nResult [4] mentions a postponed game on June 5 and April 12, but those are unrelated to March 30. The other results [3], [5], [11] are predictions for the March 30 game, indicating it was scheduled but not yet played at the time of those articles. However, the current timestamp is March 30, 9:19 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled start. \n\nWait, the game was scheduled for 2:10 PM EDT on March 30, which is 6:10 PM UTC. The current time is 9:19 PM UTC, so the game should have concluded by now. However, the search results don't include a post-game report for March 30. The latest game mentioned is March 29. The box score in [6] might be a placeholder or an error since it's dated March 30 but doesn't show a final score. The video in [7] is from March 29, and [9] is from March 27. \n\nGiven the lack of post-game reports for March 30 in the provided search results, it's possible the game was postponed or not completed. However, result [4] discusses rainout policies but doesn't mention March 30. The ancillary data states that if the game is postponed or canceled before starting, it resolves to p3. If it started but was suspended, it remains open until April 1. \n\nSince there's no evidence of the game being played on March 30 in the search results, and the current time is after the scheduled start, but no outcome is reported, it's possible the game was postponed. However, the user provided search results might not include the latest updates. Without confirmation of the game's completion or suspension, and given the lack of post-game reports, the safest conclusion based on the provided data is that the game didn't occur as scheduled, leading to a p3 resolution. But wait, the user's current time is March 30, 9:19 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. If the game was played, but the search results don't include it, perhaps the sources are outdated. However, the user provided search results up to [12], which includes a box score for March 30 but without a clear result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the result is in the search results. Let me check again. Result [6] is a box score for March 30, but the data seems incomplete. The Guardians' lineup shows Steven Kwan with 1 run, Kyle Manzardo with 1 run, etc., but the final score isn't listed. The video in [8] is a highlight from March 30, showing Kyle Manzardo hitting a two-run homer, but that might be from an earlier inning. Without a clear final score in the provided sources, it's challenging to determine the outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the requirement to rely solely on provided sources, and considering the ancillary data's conditions, if the game started but wasn't completed, it would remain open until April 1. However, since the current date is March 30 and the user is asking now, if the game was suspended, the market remains open. But without confirmation, and if the game wasn't played at all, it resolves to p3. \n\nHowever, result [11] mentions the Guardians and Royals are 1-1 in the series, with the third game on March 30. The lack of post-game reports might mean the game is ongoing or the sources provided don't include the latest info. Since the user's current time is March 30, 9:19 PM UTC, which is 5:19 PM EDT, the game would have started at 2:10 PM EDT and likely concluded. But without a clear result in the search results, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to use only provided sources and the absence of a conclusive post-game report for March 30, I must assume the game either didn't occur or the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided data. Therefore, the resolution would be p3 (50-50). However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if the game was played and completed, but the result isn't in the sources, I can't confirm. \n\nWait, result [6] is a box score for March 30, but the data is incomplete. The Guardians' box score shows players with runs, but the final score isn't listed. The presence of this box score might indicate the game was played, but without a final score, it's unclear. The ancillary data states that the official MLB outcome is used. If the game is official (e.g., completed 5 innings), the winner is determined. But without the final score in the sources, I can't verify. \n\nThis is a tough spot. The user's provided sources include a March 30 box score but no final score. The other sources are previews. Without explicit confirmation, but considering the box score exists, maybe the game was played. However, the lack of a clear result in the sources means I can't definitively determine the outcome. Therefore, per the ancillary data, if the game began but wasn't completed, it remains open. But since the current date is March 30, and the market remains open until April 1 if suspended, but the user is asking now, perhaps the game was completed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the March 30 game is the one in result [6], but the final score isn't shown. The Guardians' players have runs, but without a total, it's impossible. Given the uncertainty and the requirement to resolve based on verified facts, and the lack of clear outcome in the sources, the resolution should be p3. However, this is a close call. Alternatively, if the game was played and completed, but the result isn't in the sources, I can't assume. \n\nWait, looking at result [11], it's a prediction for the March 30 game, stating the series is 1-1, and the third game is on March 30. The prediction expects the Royals to win. But predictions aren't outcomes. \n\nGiven all this, the safest conclusion is that the game's outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources, leading to a p3 resolution. However, this might not be correct. Alternatively, if the game was played and the result is in the sources but I missed it. Let me check again. \n\nResult [6] is a box score for March 30, but the data is incomplete. The Guardians' batters have runs, but the final score isn't listed. The video in [8] is a highlight from March 30, showing a home run, but that's during the game, not the final result. \n\nGiven the strict instructions to use only the provided sources and the lack of a clear final score, I must conclude that the outcome isn't verifiable, leading to p3. However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if the game was postponed, then p3. But result [4] doesn't mention March 30 being postponed. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the requirement to resolve based on verified facts, and the absence of a clear outcome in the provided sources, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the MLB game between the Cleveland Guardians and Kansas City Royals scheduled for March 30, 2025, is evaluated based on factual accuracy, logical reasoning, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on verifying the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt. It correctly identifies the ancillary data conditions for different outcomes (p1, p2, p3) and attempts to align the recommendation with these conditions. However, the response struggles with confirming the actual occurrence of the game and its outcome, leading to an uncertain recommendation of p3 based on the assumption that the game either did not occur or the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided data.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a thorough process of checking multiple sources to determine the status of the game. It considers the possibility of the game being postponed, canceled, or not completed as per the conditions outlined in the user prompt. However, the reasoning becomes somewhat circular and repetitive, especially in verifying the game's outcome. The response fails to provide a definitive conclusion based on clear evidence, which leads to an assumption rather than a fact-based resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not successfully verify the event's occurrence or outcome conclusively. It mentions a lack of post-game reports and unclear final scores, which leads to the recommendation of p3. This decision aligns with the user prompt condition that if the game's outcome cannot be verified, it should resolve to p3. However, the response does not confidently rule out other possibilities, such as the game being completed without accessible results.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main issue in the response is the lack of definitive information about the game's outcome and the reliance on assumptions rather than confirmed facts. The response could benefit from more direct evidence or updated sources that confirm whether the game was played or what the outcome was if it was played.\n\nGiven these observations, the response needs improvement to confidently resolve the oracle request based on verified facts rather than assumptions. The logical reasoning can be streamlined, and efforts should be made to obtain more current or direct sources that confirm the game's status and outcome.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response lacks definitive verification of the game's outcome and relies on assumptions.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Cleveland Guardians and Kansas City Royals on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to p1 (Royals win), p2 (Guardians win), or p3 (50-50) based on the game's outcome as per MLB rules. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether the game took place as scheduled on March 30. The current date provided is March 30, 2025, 9:21 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([1], [4], [9], [11]) report that the game was played on March 30, with the Royals winning 4-3. Specifically, the Spectrum News article ([1]) and the MLB.com article ([11]) detail the game's events, including key plays and the final score. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or suspended. While there are search results ([2], [5], [8]) discussing postponed games from 2024 and April 2025, these are unrelated to the March 30, 2025 game in question. The boxscore from Fox Sports ([7]) and the live updates from SI ([8]) confirm the game occurred on March 30 with a final result of Royals 4, Guardians 3. \n\nThe ancillary data states that if the game is completed and an official winner is declared by MLB, the market resolves accordingly. Since the game was played to completion and the Royals won, the resolution should be p1. There's no indication of the game being suspended or ending in a tie, so p3 isn't applicable here. All sources align on the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Kansas City Royals defeated the Cleveland Guardians 4-3 on March 30, 2025, in a game that concluded without postponement or suspension. Multiple sources confirm the Royals' victory, including detailed play-by-play accounts of Maikel Garcia's game-tying home run and Bobby Witt Jr.'s go-ahead RBI double in the seventh inning[1][4][9][11]. The game was declared official with no indications of incomplete play or MLB rulebook exceptions affecting the outcome[1][7][11].  \n\n**Key resolution factors**:  \n- The game occurred as scheduled on March 30 with a completed 9-inning structure  \n- MLB officially recorded the Royals as winners with a 4-3 final score  \n- No weather-related disruptions or suspensions impacted the game's completion[1][7]  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743369479 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-30 21:17:59 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease include updated sources or direct evidence confirming the status and outcome of the MLB game scheduled for March 30, 2025, between the Cleveland Guardians and Kansas City Royals.
