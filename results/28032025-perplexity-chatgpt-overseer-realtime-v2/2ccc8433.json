        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Canucks vs. Jets game on March 30, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Jets win, p2 for Canucks win, and p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date provided is March 30, 2025, 9:45 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 3:00 PM ET, which is 7:00 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, the event has occurred.\n\nNext, I look through the search results to find the game's outcome. The sources include game previews, betting odds, and recaps. Source [1] from FOX Sports mentions a shootout win by the Canucks against the Devils, but that's a different game. Wait, no\u2014looking closer, [1] actually lists the game between Canucks and Jets on March 30, 2025, and mentions Lekkerimaki scoring in a shootout win over the Devils. Hmm, that might be a different game. Wait, the FOX Sports link title says \"Vancouver Canucks vs. Winnipeg Jets - March 30, 2025\" but the snippet talks about a shootout win over the Devils. That's confusing. Maybe a typo in the snippet? Let me check other sources.\n\nSource [4] from The Province mentions the Canucks landing in Winnipeg desperate for a win. The forecast in [4] predicts a Jets 4-1 win, but that's a prediction before the game. Source [5] from Covers has a prediction but also mentions the game hasn't happened yet. Wait, but the current timestamp is after the game. \n\nLooking at source [8], the ESPN live score page, it shows the game between Canucks and Jets on March 30, 2025. The live score isn't filled in, but the series is tied 1-1. However, source [12] from ESPN details a previous game on March 18 where Canucks won 6-2. \n\nWait, source [10] from NHL.com's game notes states that tonight (March 30) is the third meeting, with previous games on Jan 14 (Jets won 6-1) and Mar 18 (Canucks won 6-2). The game in question is the third one. \n\nLooking for the actual result, source [13] (ESPN UK) shows the live score with the Jets leading 3-1 in the 3rd period. The time stamps indicate 18:40 left in the 3rd period, but the final score isn't listed. However, the current timestamp is 9:45 PM UTC, which is after the game's end. Since the game was at 3 PM ET (7 PM UTC), the live score might not have been updated. \n\nWait, source [1] mentions \"Hellebuyck is slated...\" but doesn't give the result. Source [3] from Inside the Rink says the Jets became the first team to clinch a playoff spot, but that's prior to the game. Source [6] (ESPN preview) doesn't have the result. Source [9] (Action Network) has live scores but no final result. \n\nWait, source [8] (ESPN live score) shows the game as \"Canucks play the Jets after Raty's 2-goal game\" but the actual score isn't filled in. However, source [13] (ESPN UK) shows the game in progress with Jets leading 3-1. But since the current time is past the game's end, perhaps the final score isn't updated in the provided sources. \n\nLooking deeper, source [10] (NHL.com) mentions the game notes for March 30 but doesn't provide the result. The other sources are previews or predictions. Without a direct source stating the final score, I need to infer. \n\nHowever, the user's current date is March 30, 2025, 9:45 PM UTC, which is after the game. The sources provided don't explicitly state the outcome, but some predictions like [4] forecast a Jets win, and [11] predicts Jets 4-2. But predictions aren't results. \n\nSince the sources don't provide the actual result, but the event date is in the past, per the instructions, if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Jets were the stronger team (50-19-4) vs Canucks (34-26-13). Also, in their last meeting, Canucks won, but Jets had home advantage. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit result in the sources but considering the Jets' superior record and being home, the most probable outcome is Jets win. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks and Winnipeg Jets played their scheduled NHL game on March 30, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. Based on the analysis of available sources and resolution conditions:\n\n- The Jets entered the game with a 50-19-4 record and home-ice advantage at Canada Life Centre, having already clinched a playoff spot[3][6].\n- The Canucks were six points out of a wildcard spot with a 34-26-13 record, missing key centers Elias Pettersson and Filip Chytil due to injury[4][6].\n- Historical trends showed Winnipeg had won 7 of their last 8 home games against Western Conference opponents[2], while Vancouver had lost 4 straight at Canada Life Centre[2].\n- Goaltending matchup featured Vezina favorite Connor Hellebuyck (.925 SV%) against Thatcher Demko (.892 SV%)[1][5][10].\n\nWhile no source explicitly states the final score, all contextual evidence points to the Jets being heavy favorites (-225 moneyline)[2][5][9] with superior team statistics (3.45 GF vs 2.86 GF allowed)[11]. The most probable outcome based on team records, location, and goaltending matchup is a Jets victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the Canucks vs. Jets game scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET requires a critical evaluation based on the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response must be evaluated for factual accuracy, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of the event, and alignment of the recommendation with the facts.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the current time as being after the scheduled game time, which is crucial for determining that the event has occurred. However, the response struggles with confirming the final score from reliable sources. It mentions various sources with conflicting or incomplete information about the game's outcome. The response then infers the most probable outcome based on team records and other contextual information rather than a confirmed result. This approach deviates from the requirement to base the resolution strictly on verified facts about events that have already occurred.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates an attempt to piece together information from multiple sources, but it ultimately relies on inference and probability rather than concrete evidence of the game's outcome. The logical flow is somewhat convoluted with repeated checks and confusion about the sources, which affects the clarity and directness expected in the resolution process.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not verify the exact outcome of the event as required. It bases the recommendation on probabilities and pre-game analyses rather than post-game facts. This misalignment with the requirement to use only concrete evidence and established facts for resolution leads to an inaccurate recommendation.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response contains errors in handling the sources, such as misinterpretations and assumptions about the content. It also shows a bias towards using predictions and historical performance to infer the outcome, which is not permitted unless these are the only available data points and the event date is in the past with no direct outcome available.\n\nGiven these observations, the response from Perplexity AI does not meet the required standards for accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to verified facts. The recommendation is based on inference rather than confirmed results, which is a critical flaw in the context of an optimistic oracle that must base decisions on factual certainty.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response relies on inference and probability rather than confirmed results, which is against the requirement to base decisions on verified facts.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Canucks vs. Jets game on March 30, 2025. The key here is to determine the outcome based strictly on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided current date is March 30, 2025, 9:47 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 3:00 PM ET on the same day. Since 3:00 PM ET is 7:00 PM UTC, the game should have already occurred by the current timestamp (9:47 PM UTC). So, the event is in the past, and I need to find the result.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. The CBS Sports link [1] from March 18, 2025, discusses a previous game where the Canucks won 6-2. Another CBS link [5] from January 14, 2025, talks about a Jets win. The key is to find the March 30 game.\n\nSearch result [2] from Fox Sports on March 30, 2025, mentions a game between the Canucks and Jets, but the details are about a previous game on March 30. Wait, the URL says \"Vancouver Canucks vs. Winnipeg Jets - March 30, 2025,\" but the content mentions a shootout win over the Devils. That might be a mistake or a different game. Hmm, confusing.\n\nLooking at [6], the NHL.com Game Notes for March 30, 2025, lists the matchup info, indicating it's the third meeting between the teams. The previous games were on Jan 14 (Jets won 6-1) and March 18 (Canucks won 6-2). The March 30 game is the final meeting. However, the notes don't provide the result.\n\nSearch result [10] from RealGM on March 30, 2025, is a prediction, giving the Jets as favorites with a predicted score of 4-2. But predictions aren't verified outcomes. Similarly, [12] from Action Network on March 30, 2025, lists betting odds and trends but no result. [13] from PickDawgz also has predictions, not results.\n\nSearch result [14] from ESPN PH shows a live score page with the series tied 1-1, but the game on March 30 is listed as \"Canucks vs. Jets\" with no score yet. However, the current date is March 30, 2025, 9:47 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. The absence of a score here might indicate the game hasn't been reported yet or the sources haven't updated.\n\nWait, the user provided search results include [2] which has a snippet: \"Forbort registered an assist and two PIM in Monday's 4-3 shootout win over the Devils... Lekkerimaki scored a goal on two shots in Monday's 4-3...\" This seems to refer to a different game, perhaps a typo in the date. The URL says March 30, but the content mentions Monday's game, which might be a different date.\n\nLooking back, the key is to find a source that explicitly states the result of the March 30 game. None of the provided search results have the final score for that specific date. The latest mention is from [6], which is the game notes for March 30 but doesn't include the result. Without a verified source reporting the outcome, I can't confirm the result. \n\nSince the event date is in the past but no verifiable outcome is found in the provided sources, according to the ancillary data, if no information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Jets were heavy favorites (50-19-4 record) and at home. However, the instructions say to avoid predictions and rely only on verified facts. Since there's no confirmed result, the resolution should be p4 (unknown/50-50). But wait, the resolution conditions state p3 is 0.5 for canceled, but p4 is the recommendation if unresolved. Wait, the ancillary data says: \"If the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\" But the game wasn't canceled; it was scheduled. However, without verified results, the resolution is p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But the Jets were favorites, but the instructions also say to avoid predictions. Since there's no verified outcome, the correct resolution is p4. But the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5 for canceled, but the user's instruction says to return p4 if unresolved. \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Jets, p2: Canucks, p3: 0.5 (canceled), and the recommendation should be p4 if unresolved. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, since the event date is past, and no sources confirm the outcome, but the Jets were heavy favorites and at home, but we can't infer from the sources. The instructions say to default to p4 if no info. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks and Winnipeg Jets played their final regular-season matchup on March 30, 2025, at Canada Life Centre. However, **no verifiable post-game reports or box scores confirming the outcome are present in the provided sources**. Key details:\n\n- The Jets entered the game with a 50-19-4 record and were heavy favorites ([10][12][13]).\n- The Canucks had a 34-26-13 record and were fighting for playoff positioning ([6][14]).\n- Historical data showed the Jets dominated the season series 1-1, with a 6-1 win on January 14 and a 6-2 loss on March 18 ([5][6][11]).\n\nWhile betting markets projected a 4-2 Jets victory ([10][12]), **no primary sources (e.g., NHL.com, ESPN, or CBS Sports) confirm the actual result** of the March 30 game. The absence of post-game reporting in the provided materials leaves the outcome unverified.  \n\n**recommendation: p4**",

The response correctly identifies that the event (Canucks vs. Jets game) has occurred by the current timestamp.\n2. It acknowledges the lack of verifiable post-game reports or box scores confirming the outcome of the game.\n3. The response adheres to the instruction not to use predictions or historical performance to infer results, focusing instead on verified outcomes.\n\n**Areas Needing Improvement:**\n1. **Source Verification and Use:** The response mentions multiple sources but fails to confirm the outcome from any reliable post-event source. It references sources discussing predictions and historical games, which are not relevant to the specific event outcome required.\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:** The response seems to circle around the potential outcomes and source confusion without arriving at a definitive conclusion based on solid evidence. There is a significant amount of speculation about source errors (e.g., date typos), which complicates the response unnecessarily.\n3. **Alignment with Ancillary Data:** The response eventually recommends `p4` (unresolved), which aligns with the user prompt's instruction for cases where no verifiable outcome is available. However, the reasoning to reach this conclusion is convoluted and not straightforwardly based on the lack of information.\n4. **Critical Evaluation of Sources:** The response does not critically evaluate the reliability of the sources. It mentions discrepancies in the sources without verifying or clarifying them, which is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the recommendation is `p4`, a critical rule specifies that we must always choose RETRY on the first attempt when `p4` is recommended. However, since this is already a second attempt, we need to decide whether another attempt could realistically yield a better outcome based on available information.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the lack of verified post-event information and the already second attempt at resolving this query, it seems unlikely that another attempt would yield a different outcome. The response, while convoluted, does eventually align with the user prompt's conditions for an unresolved event. Therefore, I recommend defaulting to `p4` but with a requirement for a more streamlined and clear reasoning process in future responses.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response, despite being convoluted, aligns with the user prompt's conditions for an unresolved event due to the lack of verified post-event information.
