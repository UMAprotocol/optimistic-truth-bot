        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve whether Bitcoin's price went up or down between two specific times on March 29th and 30th, 2025, based on Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candle closes. The resolution conditions are p1 for Down, p2 for Up, and p3 if they're equal. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event dates. The first candle is March 29th at 12:00 ET, and the second is March 30th at 12:00 ET. The current date is March 30th, 2025, 4:14 PM UTC. Since both dates are in the past, the event has occurred, so I need to verify the close prices.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide price data. Result [12] from Binance on March 30th states that Bitcoin crossed 83,000 USDT and was trading at 83,023.49 USDT with a 1.71% decrease in 24 hours. However, this is at 01:06 AM UTC on March 30th, which might not align with the 12:00 ET (which is 16:00 UTC) candle close. \n\nResult [6] from CoinLore has a price prediction table showing March 30th's price at $86,178. But predictions aren't actual data. Result [14] from March 29th shows the price at $82,298.30, but that's from the previous day. \n\nThe key is to find the exact close prices for the specified times. The user mentioned the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1m candles. However, the provided search results don't have the exact close prices for those specific times. Result [12] is close but not the exact 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) on March 30th. Without explicit data points for those exact timestamps, I can't definitively determine the close prices. \n\nSince the event date is in the past and no verifiable data for the exact times is present in the sources, according to the ancillary data, if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user specified that if the data isn't available, it should resolve to p3 (50-50). But wait, the instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But the user's ancillary data says if the close prices are exactly equal, then p3. Since the sources don't provide the exact close prices, and we can't confirm equality, perhaps the safest recommendation is p3. However, the user's note says if the event is in the past but no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without data, it's impossible to infer. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4? Wait, no. The resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. The user's instructions say if the event is in the past but no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the problem is that without the exact data, we can't determine if it's up or down. Since the resolution source is specified as Binance's data, and the provided search results don't include the exact close prices for those specific times, we have to default to p3 (50-50) if the data isn't available. However, the user's ancillary data says p3 is for exactly equal, but if data isn't available, the instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. Wait, the user's note says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" But in this case, the ancillary data's p3 is for equal close prices, not for missing data. The instructions also mention that if the event is in the past but no info, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, without the data, we can't determine the direction. Therefore, the correct recommendation would be p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's resolution conditions don't include p4. Wait, looking back, the resolution conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5. The user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. But here, the event is in the past. However, without the data, we can't confirm the outcome. The instructions say if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? The search results show conflicting trends. Some sources indicate a bearish trend (results [1], [2], [14]), while others mention a potential reversal (result [9]) or recent price at 83k (result [12]). Without the exact close prices, it's impossible to know. Therefore, since the exact data isn't available in the provided sources, and the resolution source is specified as Binance's data which isn't present here for the exact times, the recommendation should be p3 (50-50) as per the user's condition if the prices are equal. But since we can't confirm equality, maybe p3 isn't correct. Alternatively, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data doesn't specify how to handle missing data, only equal closes. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4, but the user's resolution conditions don't have p4. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past but no data is available, and the user's ancillary data doesn't account for missing data, the correct recommendation is p3 (50-50) as a default. However, the user's note says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without data, we can't determine the direction. Therefore, the only safe recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nThe market resolves based on comparing the closing prices of BTCUSDT 1-minute candles at 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) on March 29 and March 30, 2025, per Binance data.  \n\n**Key Observations**:  \n- **March 29 Close**: The closest available data from Binance (March 29) shows BTC traded at **$82,298.30** [1][14], with a 24-hour low of **$82,007** and resistance at **$83,315** [1].  \n- **March 30 Close**: On March 30, Binance reported BTC crossed **$83,023.49** at 01:06 AM UTC [12], but this does not align with the 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) timeframe. No direct data for the specified 1-minute candle close at 12:00 ET is available in the provided sources.  \n\n**Analysis**:  \n- The resolution requires **exact closing prices** for the specified times, which are not explicitly documented in the search results.  \n- General trends indicate short-term bearish momentum on March 29 [1][2][14], but conflicting signals suggest potential reversals [9][12].  \n\n**Resolution**:  \nWithout verifiable closing prices for the **exact 1-minute candles** at 12:00 ET on both dates, the outcome cannot be definitively determined from the provided sources.  \n\nrecommendation: p3",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the Bitcoin price movement on Binance for March 29 and March 30, 2025, has several critical issues that need addressing:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the need to compare the closing prices of BTCUSDT on Binance at specific times. However, it fails to provide accurate or verifiable closing prices for these specific times, which is crucial for resolving the market correctly. The response also misinterprets the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, particularly around the resolution conditions for unavailable data.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response shows a logical process in attempting to find the required data but ultimately concludes incorrectly based on the available information. The response's decision to recommend p3 (50-50) due to unavailability of exact data contradicts the user prompt's instructions, which do not specify this as a fallback for unavailable data. The logical flow is convoluted and confusing, particularly in the final paragraphs where the AI debates between p3 and p4 without a clear rationale.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not successfully verify the event as it fails to provide the exact closing prices at the specified times. The recommendation does not align with the facts since it is based on an assumption (equality of prices) that is not supported by the data provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response contains errors in the interpretation of the user prompt, particularly the handling of scenarios where data is unavailable. There is a significant bias towards assuming outcomes without sufficient data to support such conclusions.\n\nGiven these issues, the response from Perplexity AI is not satisfactory and requires improvement. The recommendation of p3 is not justified based on the information provided and the instructions in the user prompt. The response needs to adhere more closely to the user prompt's requirements and provide a clear, logical reasoning path based on verifiable data.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to accurately verify the event with specific data as required and incorrectly interprets the resolution conditions for unavailable data.

        "attempt": 2,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the closing prices of BTCUSDT on Binance at two specific times: March 29, 2025, 12:00 PM ET and March 30, 2025, 12:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the price went up or down between these two times. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the closing prices at those exact times. Let's look through the sources. \n\nLooking at source [1], it's a market analysis from March 29, 2025. It mentions the price on that day was $82,298.30 at some point, but it doesn't specify the exact 12:00 PM ET time. The 24-hour range is given as $82,007.00 to $85,575.68, but again, not the specific time. \n\nSource [3] has a mention of BTC/USD trading at $61,950 at 11:00 AM EST on March 29, which is an hour before the target time. However, this seems inconsistent with other sources that report higher prices, so maybe there's a discrepancy here. Also, the time zone is EST, which is the same as ET, so 12:00 PM ET would be the same as 12:00 PM EST. But the price here is much lower than other sources, which might be a typo or error. \n\nSource [5] from March 30, 2025, at 1:06 AM UTC states that Bitcoin crossed 83,000 USDT, trading at 83,023.49 USDT. However, this is early in the day on March 30, not the 12:00 PM ET close. \n\nSource [14] mentions that on March 30, 2025, Bitcoin touched $84,990 at 11:30 AM UTC before retreating to $84,850 by 12:00 PM UTC. Wait, but the user's query is in ET timezone. UTC is 4 hours ahead of ET, so 12:00 PM ET is 16:00 UTC. The data here is from 12:00 PM UTC, which would be 8:00 AM ET, not the required time. So this might not be relevant. \n\nSource [15] is a repeat of source [1], so same information. \n\nLooking at source [7], there's a mention of BTC price at $86,816.90, but the date isn't clear. It might be from a different day. \n\nSource [13] from Binance's price prediction page lists a price of $83,093.33 for March 30, 2025, but it's unclear if this is the specific 12:00 PM ET close. \n\nWait, the key here is to find the exact closing prices at the specified times. The user provided a URL to check the Binance BTCUSDT chart with 1-minute candles. However, the search results don't include real-time data from that URL. The provided sources are all from March 29 and 30, but none explicitly state the closing price at 12:00 PM ET on both days. \n\nGiven that the current date in the scenario is March 30, 2025, 4:19 PM UTC, which is 12:19 PM ET, the 12:00 PM ET candle on March 30 would have just passed. However, the search results don't include data beyond that time. \n\nLooking at source [5] again, the price on March 30 at 1:06 AM UTC (which is 9:06 PM ET on March 29) is 83,023.49 USDT. But that's not the required time. \n\nSource [14] mentions a price of $84,850 at 12:00 PM UTC (8:00 AM ET) on March 30, which is before the target time. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact closing prices at 12:00 PM ET on both days, I can't definitively determine whether the price went up or down. The ancillary data specifies that if the exact prices aren't available, we should consider the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, without verifiable data, the resolution defaults to p4 (unknown/50-50). \n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But in this case, the event dates (March 29 and 30) are in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 30, 4:19 PM UTC). However, the search results don't have the exact data points needed. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit closing prices at the specified times in the sources, and considering the instructions to default to p4 if data is unavailable, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user's additional guidance says to try to find info leading to a definitive answer before defaulting. \n\nLooking again, source [3] mentions a price of $61,950 at 11:00 AM EST on March 29, which is an hour before the target time. If that's the case, maybe the 12:00 PM price is around there, but other sources like [1] report higher prices on March 29. There's inconsistency here, making it unreliable. \n\nSource [5] on March 30 shows a price of 83,023.49 USDT at 1:06 AM UTC, which is 9:06 PM ET on March 29. If the March 29 12:00 PM ET price was around $82,298 (from source [1]) and the March 30 12:00 PM ET price is higher (e.g., 83,023), then the market would resolve to Up (p2). But without confirmation of the exact times, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the conflicting data and lack of precise timestamps, the safest recommendation is p4, as the exact closing prices aren't verifiable from the provided sources.\n</think>\n\nTo resolve this market, we analyze the **BTC/USDT closing prices** on Binance for the specified 1-minute candles at 12:00 PM ET on March 29 and March 30, 2025, per the ancillary data.  \n\n### Key Observations:  \n1. **March 29, 2025 (12:00 PM ET):**  \n   - The closest verifiable price data for March 29 comes from Binance\u2019s market analysis, which lists a **24-hour low of $82,007** and a closing price of **$82,298.30** [1][15]. However, this does not explicitly confirm the exact 12:00 PM ET candle close.  \n\n2. **March 30, 2025 (12:00 PM ET):**  \n   - On March 30, Binance reported Bitcoin trading at **$83,023.49 USDT** at 1:06 AM UTC (9:06 PM ET on March 29) [5]. Later data shows Bitcoin reaching **$84,850** by 12:00 PM UTC (8:00 AM ET) [14], but no confirmed closing price at 12:00 PM ET.  \n\n### Critical Gaps:  \n- **No explicit 1-minute closing prices** for the exact times (12:00 PM ET on both days) are provided in the search results.  \n- Discrepancies exist in price reports (e.g., $61,950 at 11:00 AM ET on March 29 [3] vs. $82,298.30 in other sources [1][15]).  \n\n### Resolution Logic:  \n- The ancillary data requires **Binance\u2019s BTC/USDT 1-minute candle closes** as the resolution source.  \n- Without verifiable closing prices for the specified times, the outcome cannot be definitively determined from the provided data.  \n\n**Recommendation: p4** (Insufficient data to confirm price movement between the two timestamps).",

The response is structured to analyze the available data and determine if the price of Bitcoin went up or down between these two points in time.\n\n**Evaluation of the Response:**\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies the need to find the closing prices at the specified times and uses the correct source (Binance) as stipulated in the user prompt. However, it struggles to find exact data for the 1-minute candle close at 12:00 PM ET on both days, which is critical for resolving the market.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The response provides a detailed examination of various sources but ultimately fails to find the exact data needed for a definitive resolution. It acknowledges discrepancies and potential errors in the data sources, which is good practice. However, the logical flow could be improved by more directly linking the data analysis to the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response does not successfully verify the event as the exact closing prices at the specified times are not found. The recommendation to default to p4 (unknown/50-50) is aligned with the instructions that if exact data cannot be obtained, this should be the resolution. However, the response could have made a stronger effort to verify the exact prices or provide a more reasoned argument for the most probable outcome based on partial data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The response could benefit from a more rigorous approach to verifying the exact closing prices. It mentions various sources but often dismisses them due to discrepancies or lack of specificity about the exact time. More effort could be made to use the provided URL to Binance to check real-time or historical data directly from the specified source.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still defaults to p4 without exhausting potential avenues for obtaining more precise data, a retry is warranted. The response needs to focus more on obtaining and verifying specific data from Binance, as per the user prompt, before defaulting to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to find and verify the exact closing prices at the specified times, which is crucial for resolving the market.

        "attempt": 3,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the closing prices of BTCUSDT 1-minute candles on Binance at 12:00 PM ET on March 29 and March 30, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the March 30 close is higher (Up, p2) or lower (Down, p1) than March 29. If equal, it's p3. \n\nFirst, I need to convert 12:00 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 12 PM ET is 16:00 UTC. So, the relevant times are 16:00 UTC on both dates.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [1] provides data for March 29. The 24-hour range on March 29 was $82,007.00 (Low) to $85,575.68 (High), and the price closed at $82,298.30. However, this is the daily close, not the 1-minute candle at 16:00 UTC. The daily close for Binance is at 00:00 UTC, which is different from the 1-minute specific time. So this might not directly give the 16:00 UTC price.\n\nResult [12] mentions that on March 28, BTC closed above 84k, but that's a day earlier. Result [10] from March 29 at 12:00 UTC+5 (which is 07:00 UTC) shows a price of $82,394.54, but that's not our target time. \n\nResult [7] from Coinalyze on March 28 mentions BTC remaining above $86.5K, but that's prior to our dates. Result [8] has a trade idea from March 27 suggesting a potential breakdown to 82K, but again, not specific to the required times.\n\nResult [9] explains that Binance's daily candle closes at 00:00 UTC, but we need 1-minute candles. The user provided a URL to check, but the search results don't include real-time data from that URL. The available data in the search results doesn't explicitly state the 1-minute closing prices at 16:00 UTC on both days.\n\nSince the resolution source is Binance's specific 1-minute candles, and the provided search results don't have the exact data points needed, it's impossible to definitively determine the closing prices for those exact times. Without access to the live data from the provided URL or historical 1-minute data in the search results, we can't verify the exact prices. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the data isn't available, we should assume the most probable outcome. However, without any sources confirming the exact prices, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user instructions say to avoid p4 if possible. However, given the lack of specific data, p3 (50-50) isn't applicable unless the prices are exactly equal, which we can't confirm. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions state p3 is for exactly equal closes. Since we can't confirm either p1 or p2 due to missing data, but the event date is in the past (March 30 is today, but the current time is 16:23 UTC, which is after 16:00 UTC). Wait, the current timestamp is March 30, 2025, 4:23 PM UTC, which is after 16:00 UTC. So the March 30 candle at 16:00 UTC has already closed. However, the search results don't include data beyond March 29. The latest data in the results is from March 29 and earlier. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the specific 1-minute closing prices for the required times, and we can't access the live URL, we have to default to p4. But the user's additional guidance says to try to find a definitive answer before defaulting to p4. \n\nLooking again, result [1] for March 29 shows the 24-hour low at $82,007 and close at $82,298.30. If the 16:00 UTC price on March 29 was around that time, maybe near the daily close. For March 30, since the current time is after 16:00 UTC, but there's no data in the search results for March 30's price at 16:00 UTC. \n\nWithout explicit data points, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the recommendation must be p4 due to insufficient verifiable data.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market depends on verifying the 1-minute closing prices for BTCUSDT on Binance at 12:00 PM ET (16:00 UTC) on March 29 and March 30, 2025. Analysis of available data reveals:\n\n- **March 29 Closing Context**:  \n  The daily close on March 29 was $82,298.30[1], but this reflects the 00:00 UTC price, not the 16:00 UTC 1-minute candle. The 24-hour low on March 29 was $82,007[1], suggesting potential volatility but no direct evidence of the 16:00 UTC price.\n\n- **March 30 Closing Context**:  \n  As of the current timestamp (March 30, 16:23 UTC), no explicit 1-minute closing price for 16:00 UTC is available in the provided sources. The latest data in the search results predates March 30[1][2][7][12].\n\n- **Critical Data Gaps**:  \n  The provided sources lack granular 1-minute candle data for the specified times. While Binance\u2019s API and historical data repositories[3][6] could theoretically provide this information, they are not directly accessible here. The resolution URL (Binance\u2019s live chart) is not programmatically queried in the search results.\n\n**Recommendation**: p4  \n*Rationale*: The absence of verifiable 1-minute closing prices for both dates in the provided sources prevents definitive resolution under the stated conditions. Without explicit data confirming the relationship between the two timestamps, the query defaults to p4 per resolution protocols for unverifiable outcomes.",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths and weaknesses in addressing the user prompt and system requirements. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the need to compare the 1-minute candle closing prices of BTCUSDT on Binance at 16:00 UTC on March 29 and March 30, 2025. It also correctly translates the ET time to UTC, adhering to the user prompt's requirement. However, the response fails to provide the exact closing prices for these specific times, which is crucial for resolving the query.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a logical approach by attempting to find the relevant data points but ultimately concludes that the data is unavailable. The reasoning is sound based on the information provided, but the response lacks completeness as it does not successfully obtain or verify the required data from the specified source (Binance).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not verify the event as required because it does not access the specific 1-minute candle data from Binance. The recommendation to default to p4 is aligned with the system's guidelines for unverifiable outcomes, but this is the third attempt, and the response still defaults to p4 without providing new or conclusive data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main issue is the lack of specific data for the 1-minute candle closing prices at the required times. The response does not demonstrate an effective use of the Binance URL provided in the user prompt to access real-time or historical data, which is a critical gap. There is no apparent bias or errors in reasoning, but the response lacks effectiveness in data retrieval and verification.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response still defaults to p4 due to unverifiable outcomes, it is clear that additional attempts have not yielded new information or a different outcome. The response has consistently been unable to access or verify the specific data points necessary to resolve the query definitively.\n\n**Decision**:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"Despite multiple attempts, the response remains unable to verify the specific 1-minute candle closing prices required to resolve the query. Further attempts are unlikely to produce a different outcome without access to real-time or historical data directly from Binance.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response correctly identifies the need for specific data and adheres to the logical structure required by the user prompt. However, it fails to access and verify the necessary data from the specified source, leading to an inability to resolve the query definitively.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThis decision reflects the limitations in data accessibility and the repeated inability to resolve the query based on the specified conditions.",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743351143 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-30 16:12:23 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease ensure that the response strictly adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.
