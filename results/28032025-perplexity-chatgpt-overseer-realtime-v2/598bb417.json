        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Medina vs. Gautier fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Gautier wins, it's p1; if Medina wins, p2; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 29, 2025, it's p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The current date provided is March 29, 2025, 10:48 PM UTC. The fight was scheduled for March 29, 2025, in Mexico City. The main card start time was 4 PM EST, which is 8 PM UTC. Since the current time is 10:48 PM UTC, the event should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [5] from f4wonline.com provides live results. It mentions the Mederos vs. Hubbard fight ending in a split decision, but there's no mention of the Medina vs. Gautier fight's outcome yet. Result [11] from ESPN's fight center lists the Medina vs. Gautier fight as upcoming, with no result reported. Similarly, result [14] from Sherdog lists the fight as part of the event but doesn't provide the result yet. \n\nSince the event is ongoing and the fight in question might not have concluded by the current time (10:48 PM UTC), there's a possibility that the result isn't available yet. However, some sources like [5] and [14] are from the same date but don't report the outcome of this specific fight. \n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. However, the event date is today, and the fight time was scheduled for 6:00 PM EST (which is 10:00 PM UTC). The current time is 10:48 PM UTC, so the fight should have occurred. But without explicit confirmation in the search results, it's unclear. \n\nIf no verifiable outcome is found, and the event date is in the past, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The betting odds heavily favor Gautier (e.g., -470 in [3], -435 in [1]), and predictions from sources like [2] and [8] expect Gautier to win by KO. However, without confirmed results, the safe resolution is p4 if the fight hasn't happened yet. But since the event is today and past the scheduled time, but no result is found, perhaps it's still ongoing. \n\nWait, result [5] mentions live results up to Mederos vs. Hubbard, which was the last prelim fight. The main card starts at 7 PM ET (11 PM UTC), so the current time is 10:48 PM UTC, which is 6:48 PM ET. The main card hasn't started yet, so the Medina vs. Gautier fight, being on the prelims, might have already happened. The prelims start at 4 PM ET (8 PM UTC), so by 10:48 PM UTC, the prelims would have concluded. \n\nLooking again at result [11], the ESPN fight center lists the Medina vs. Gautier fight as part of the prelims, but the result isn't shown. Result [14] from Sherdog's live play-by-play also doesn't list the result yet, indicating the fight might not have occurred or the results aren't updated. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results in the provided sources and the event's timing, it's possible the fight hasn't been reported yet. However, the user's instructions state that if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Since Gautier is the heavy favorite and predicted to win, the resolution would be p1. But the user's personalization also says if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the fight's ring walks were approx. 6 PM EST (10 PM UTC), and the current time is 10:48 PM UTC, so the fight should have started. If the sources don't report the result, perhaps it's still ongoing or the result isn't in yet. \n\nIn this case, since the fight was scheduled for today but the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources, and the resolution conditions state that if unresolved by April 29, it's p3. However, the current date is March 29, so if the fight hasn't happened yet (which it should have), but no result is available, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve now). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. The event date is today, and the fight time has passed, but no result is found. The instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. Therefore, despite no explicit result, the resolution would be p1 (Gautier) based on predictions and odds. However, the user's note says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Since the current time is 10:48 PM UTC, and the fight was at 10 PM UTC, it's past, but without confirmation, maybe it's safer to go with p4. But the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable. \n\nGiven the conflicting factors, but following the instruction to assume probable outcome if event date is past and no info, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe bout between Jos\u00e9 Daniel Medina and Ateba Abega Gautier at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025, was scheduled as part of the prelims, with ring walks approximately at 10:00 PM UTC. As of the current timestamp (10:48 PM UTC), the event has commenced, but the provided search results do not explicitly confirm the fight's outcome. However, multiple sources indicate Gautier as the heavy favorite, with betting odds ranging from -435 to -470[1][3][12] and predictions strongly favoring a knockout victory[2][8]. Given the event date has passed and no verifiable postponement or cancellation is reported, the resolution aligns with the most probable outcome based on ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response attempts to resolve the market based on the outcome of the Medina vs. Gautier fight, scheduled for March 29, 2025. The response navigates through the complexities of determining whether the fight has concluded and if the results are available. However, there are several critical issues in the response that need addressing:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the fight date and checks the current time to determine if the event has already occurred. However, it struggles with the decision-making process regarding whether the fight's outcome can be resolved. The response initially suggests that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, it should return p4, but it then vacillates between recommending p1 and p4. This inconsistency shows a misunderstanding of the instructions, which clearly state that if the event has not occurred yet or the outcome is not verifiable, p4 should be recommended.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a logical approach by checking multiple sources to confirm the fight's outcome. However, it becomes entangled in its reasoning, especially when it discusses the timing of the main card and prelims. The response incorrectly concludes that the fight might still be ongoing or the results are not updated, despite the current time being past the scheduled fight time. This leads to a recommendation based on the most probable outcome (p1) instead of adhering to the instruction to return p4 if the outcome cannot be verified.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response fails to verify the event's outcome conclusively. It relies heavily on the assumption that Gautier would win based on betting odds and predictions, which is not a factual resolution but a speculative one. This approach does not align with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not adequately address the possibility that the fight's result might not be reported yet, despite the event date being today and the time being past the scheduled fight time. It also incorrectly uses speculative information (betting odds and predictions) to lean towards a resolution (p1), which is against the instructions provided.\n\nGiven these issues, the response does not meet the required standards for accuracy, logical reasoning, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation of p1 based on speculative information rather than confirmed facts is particularly concerning.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to adhere to the instructions of returning p4 when the outcome of the event cannot be verified. It incorrectly uses speculative information to recommend p1.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response shows logical inconsistencies and a misunderstanding of the instructions regarding the resolution of events based on verified facts.

        "attempt": 2,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about the resolution of a UFC fight between Jos\u00e9 Daniel Medina and Ateba Abega Gautier that took place on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Gautier wins, it's p1; if Medina wins, p2; and if there's a draw, postponement, or cancellation, it's p3 (50-50). The current date given is March 29, 2025, at 10:51 PM UTC, which is after the event's scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any information about the fight's outcome. The search results provided include previews, predictions, weigh-in results, and live results pages. \n\nLooking at the sources, most of them are previews or predictions made before the event. For example, sources [1], [3], [5], [8], [9], and [12] all discuss the fighters' records, predictions, and odds, with Gautier being the heavy favorite. However, these are all pre-fight analyses and don't confirm the actual result.\n\nSource [2] is a live play-by-play and results page from Sherdog. The page lists the fighters but under the \"Official Result\" section for their fight, there's no data filled in. The same goes for other fights on the card; the results sections are blank. This suggests that either the results weren't updated or the event was still ongoing when the page was captured. \n\nSource [6] is another live results page, but it only provides details about the main event fighters and doesn't mention the Medina vs. Gautier bout's outcome. Source [10] from ESPN's fight center lists the fighters but doesn't show the result, indicating the fight might not have concluded yet or the result wasn't posted.\n\nThe key point here is the current timestamp: March 29, 2025, 10:51 PM UTC. The fight was scheduled to take place on the same day. The walkout time for their fight was listed as 10:25 PM UK time (which is GMT), so converting that to UTC, it's also 10:25 PM UTC. The current time in the query is 10:51 PM UTC, which is just 26 minutes after the scheduled walkout. UFC fights can last up to 15 minutes for three-round bouts, but depending on the card's progress, there might be delays. However, even if the fight happened on time, the result might not have been immediately available in the sources provided.\n\nSince none of the search results confirm the actual outcome\u2014only predictions and live pages without updated results\u2014it's possible that the fight either hasn't concluded yet or the results haven't been published in the sources provided. According to the resolution conditions, if the event is postponed after April 29, 2025, it would resolve to p3. However, the event date is March 29, so postponement after April 29 isn't applicable here. \n\nGiven that the current time is just after the scheduled fight time and no verified results are available in the provided sources, the resolution should default to p4. Wait, but the ancillary data mentions p3 for draws, cancellations, etc. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the past but no verifiable outcome is found, and it's not postponed, assume the most probable outcome. But the problem here is that the fight might still be ongoing or the results not yet reported. \n\nBut wait, the current time is 10:51 PM UTC, and the walkout was at 10:25 PM UTC. A three-round fight would typically last about 15 minutes, so the fight should have concluded by 10:40 PM UTC. The results might not have been updated in the sources yet. Since the user provided sources up to [12], which includes the UFC's own site ([12]) but it only lists Gautier's profile without the fight result. \n\nIn the absence of confirmed results from reliable sources like ESPN or official UFC results in the provided search results, and considering the event's time has just passed, the resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). However, the personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the event is on the same day, and the current time is shortly after the scheduled time. \n\nWait, the current date in the query is March 29, 2025, 10:51 PM UTC. The fight was scheduled for March 29, 2025. The walkout was at 10:25 PM UTC, and the current time is 10:51 PM UTC. The fight would have likely concluded, but the sources provided don't have the result. The Sherdog live results ([2]) and ESPN's fight center ([10]) don't show the result. Therefore, without verified sources confirming the outcome, even though the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, the resolution should be p4 because the information isn't available in the provided sources. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also state that if the event is on the same day but hasn't occurred yet (based on current time), it's p4. \n\nWait, the event is on March 29, and the current time is 10:51 PM UTC. The fight's walkout was at 10:25 PM UTC, so the fight should have happened. But if the sources don't report the result yet, perhaps because it's too recent, then according to the rules, if no verifiable info is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on pre-fight analysis is Gautier winning by KO/TKO. However, the instructions say to only resolve based on verified facts, not predictions. \n\nTherefore, since there's no confirmed result in the sources, even though predictions heavily favor Gautier, the correct resolution is p4 because the outcome isn't verified yet. The user's personalization emphasizes relying solely on verified facts, not predictions. Hence, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe bout between Jos\u00e9 Daniel Medina and Ateba Abega Gautier at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025, was scheduled for the same day as the current timestamp (March 29, 2025, 10:51 PM UTC). While pre-fight analyses heavily favored Gautier as the likely winner\u2014citing his knockout power and status as a -470 betting favorite\u2014none of the provided sources confirm the actual outcome of the fight[1][5][8][9]. Live results pages from Sherdog and ESPN list the fighters but lack updated results or official announcements for this specific bout[2][10].  \n\nGiven the absence of verified reporting on the fight\u2019s conclusion at the time of this query, and adhering to the requirement to resolve based strictly on confirmed facts rather than predictions, the resolution defaults to **p4**. This reflects the inability to definitively determine the outcome using the available sources.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by not predicting outcomes based on pre-fight analyses or betting odds, which was a flaw in the previous response. It correctly identifies that the fight's outcome cannot be determined from the available sources and thus defaults to p4, aligning with the requirement to base the resolution strictly on confirmed facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates thorough logical reasoning by detailing the timeline of the event and the timestamps of the sources checked. It correctly notes that the fight was scheduled on the same day as the query and shortly before the current timestamp, making it reasonable to assume that the fight might have concluded but the results were not yet updated in the sources provided. This reasoning is sound and aligns with the system prompt's requirements for handling events scheduled for the same day.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively uses the provided sources to verify that no outcome has been confirmed for the fight. It correctly concludes that without verified results, the resolution must default to p4, adhering to the system prompt's directive to resolve based on verified facts only.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI has correctly interpreted the user prompt and system prompt instructions. It has also appropriately defaulted to p4 due to the lack of verified information, which is a correct application under the given circumstances.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response has significantly improved from the previous one by addressing the issues of using predictions for resolution and by adhering strictly to verified facts, the evaluation leads to the following decision:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the instructions by not predicting outcomes based on pre-fight analyses or betting odds. It logically and correctly defaults to p4 due to the absence of verified information on the fight's outcome, aligning with the requirement to base resolutions strictly on confirmed facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and logically sound, demonstrating a correct understanding of the system prompt requirements and effectively using the provided sources to verify the absence of confirmed results.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThis decision reflects confidence in the response's accuracy and reliability, fulfilling the criteria set forth for evaluating the Perplexity AI oracle response.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
