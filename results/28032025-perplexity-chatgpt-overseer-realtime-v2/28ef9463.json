The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Chicago Cubs vs. Arizona Diamondbacks game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Diamondbacks, p2 is Cubs, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 30, 2025, 11:23 PM UTC. The game was set for 4:10 PM ET, which is 8:10 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the game's start time, it should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources confirming the game's result. Source [1] from AP News states the Cubs won 4-3. Another source [7] is a video recap titled \"Chicago Cubs 4-3 win over Arizona Diamondbacks,\" which aligns with the AP report. Additionally, source [12] on ESPN AU's recap also confirms the Cubs' 4-3 victory. \n\nThe resolution conditions mention using the official MLB outcome. All credible sources here point to the Cubs as the winners. There's no indication the game was postponed, suspended, or ended in a tie. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2, corresponding to the Cubs' win.\n</think>\n\nThe Chicago Cubs defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 on March 30, 2025, in a game that concluded as scheduled. The outcome was officially recorded by Major League Baseball, with the Cubs securing the win[1][7][12]. The game began and ended on the scheduled date without postponement, suspension, or cancellation, and no tie was declared. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided (p1: Diamondbacks, p2: Cubs, p3: 50-50), this market resolves to **p2** (Cubs win).\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Chicago Cubs vs. Arizona Diamondbacks game on March 30, 2025) and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The response uses multiple credible sources (AP News, a video recap, and ESPN AU) to verify the outcome of the game, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks if the game occurred as scheduled and verifies the outcome using multiple sources. It correctly concludes that the game was not postponed, suspended, or ended in a tie, and thus resolves the market based on the Cubs' win as per the conditions provided (p1: Diamondbacks, p2: Cubs, p3: 50-50).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome on the specified date and time. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Cubs win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the ancillary data provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response adequately covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the provided conditions and verified information.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the instructions and conditions specified in the user prompt, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using credible sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
