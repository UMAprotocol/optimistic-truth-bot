        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the MLB game between the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Diamondbacks, p2 is Cubs, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's outcome. Checking the search results, multiple sources report the game. Result [2] states the Diamondbacks won 10-6 with an 8th inning rally. Source [4] also details the 8-run 8th inning leading to a 10-6 victory. The box score in [6] and [8] corroborate the final score. \n\nNext, ensure the game wasn't postponed or suspended. All sources mention the game was played on March 30, with no indications of postponement. The game was completed as per the detailed play-by-plays and the final score. MLB rules would consider this an official game since it went past the 5th inning. \n\nSince the Diamondbacks won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of a tie or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All evidence points to a clear Diamondbacks victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the Chicago Cubs 10-6 in their March 30, 2025 matchup at Chase Field. Trailing 6-2 in the 8th inning, the Diamondbacks staged an eight-run rally featuring key hits including Lourdes Gurriel Jr.'s game-tying two-run homer and Josh Naylor's go-ahead RBI double[2][4][6]. Pitcher Ryne Nelson even contributed an RBI single as a pinch hitter during the decisive inning[4]. The game concluded without postponement or suspension, meeting MLB's official game requirements[2][4].\n\nrecommendation: p1",
