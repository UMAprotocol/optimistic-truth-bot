The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MLB game between the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Padres, p2 is Braves, and p3 is 50-50 if the game is postponed, canceled, or suspended without completion by March 31. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game on March 29, with sources [1], [2], [4], [5], and [8] providing details. Source [2] from AccessWDUN clearly states that the Padres won 1-0 on March 29. The box score in [4] and the recap in [2] confirm the final score. The game wasn't postponed or suspended, as it's reported as completed. \n\nNext, verifying the official outcome. MLB's rules state that a game is official after 5 innings. The game went to 9 innings, so it's official. The Padres won, so according to the resolution conditions, p1 (Padres) should be the result. No indications of postponement or cancellation in the sources. All evidence points to a completed game with a clear winner. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe San Diego Padres defeated the Atlanta Braves 1-0 in the MLB game played on March 29, 2025, at PETCO Park. The decisive run came in the seventh inning when pinch-hitter Yuli Gurriel singled to score Jake Cronenworth, who reached base on a ground-rule double after a deflected ball[2][5]. The game was completed without postponement or suspension, and the outcome was officially recorded by MLB[2][4][8].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409086 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:18:06 UTC"
