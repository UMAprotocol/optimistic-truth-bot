The ancillary data specifies that if Houston wins, it's p1; Tennessee, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was on March 30, so it's already happened. Now, I need to verify the result using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, multiple articles confirm the outcome. Source [2] from wtvr.com states Houston won 69-50. Source [9] from cbssports.com also reports the same score, with Houston advancing to the Final Four. Other sources like [11] (abc13.com) and [13] (YouTube highlights) corroborate the victory. \n\nThe key points are the final score, Houston's dominance, and their advancement. Since the game occurred as scheduled and wasn't postponed or canceled, the resolution is straightforward. All sources point to a Houston win, so the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information found, so no need to consider p2 or p3.\n</think>\n\nHouston defeated Tennessee 69-50 in the March 30, 2025, NCAA Elite Eight game, advancing to the Final Four. The Cougars dominated defensively, holding Tennessee to 15 first-half points\u2014the lowest ever by a top-two seed in tournament history[2][4][15]. Key performances came from L.J. Cryer (17 points) and Emanuel Sharp (16 points), with Houston maintaining a double-digit lead for most of the game[2][9][11]. The game was completed as scheduled without postponement or cancellation. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and established outcomes, avoiding any predictions or assumptions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It provides a detailed account of the game, including scores and key performances, which supports the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Houston win) with the verified outcome of the game, as outlined in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring reliability and reducing the risk of bias.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the system prompt, and logical reasoning, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410707 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:45:07 UTC"
