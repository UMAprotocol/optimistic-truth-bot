        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Tennessee vs. Houston basketball game. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 30, 2025, 8:32:09 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 30 at 2:20 PM ET, which is 6:20 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the scheduled game time, the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources report the game's outcome. Search result [14] mentions Tennessee scored only 15 points in the first half, trailing Houston 34-15 at halftime. Result [15] from ESPN shows the final score as Houston 50, Tennessee 35. Result [16] confirms Houston's dominant first half and their lead, and result [17] also discusses Houston's victory. \n\nAll these sources agree that Houston won the game. The ancillary data specifies that if Houston wins, the resolution is p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 for Houston's victory.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Men's Basketball Elite Eight game between the Houston Cougars and Tennessee Volunteers occurred on March 30, 2025, as scheduled. **Houston defeated Tennessee 50-35** in a dominant defensive performance[14][15][16]. The Cougars held Tennessee to 21.4% field goal shooting in the first half (15 points) and maintained control throughout the game[14][16]. This outcome qualifies for resolution under the ancillary data's defined conditions.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the current date and time as being after the scheduled game time, confirming that the event has already occurred. It then uses multiple reliable sources to verify the outcome of the game, which is that Houston won against Tennessee. This outcome is consistent with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Houston win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds from verifying the current time, to confirming the event has occurred, to checking multiple sources for the game's outcome. It correctly ignores the possibilities of postponement or cancellation since there is no indication of either in the sources. The response is thorough in its approach to resolving the query based on the conditions set in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, which all agree on Houston's victory. The recommendation of p1 aligns perfectly with the ancillary data's definition for a Houston win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the user prompt and system instructions, using only verified facts to make its recommendation.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the requirements set forth in the system prompt.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743366668 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-30 20:31:08 UTC"
