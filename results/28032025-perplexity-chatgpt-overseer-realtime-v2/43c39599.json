The ancillary data specifies that if the Lightning win, it's p1; if the Islanders win, p2; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 29, 2025, 8:51 PM UTC. The game was set for 2:00 PM ET, which is 18:00 UTC. Since the current time is past that, the game should have concluded.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [16] from Plain Text Sports shows a final score of Lightning 5, Islanders 3. The box score details goals in each period, including an empty-net goal by Jake Guentzel of the Lightning. This is a direct indication that the game was played and concluded with Tampa Bay winning.\n\nOther sources like [1], [3], [6], [10], and [13] discuss predictions and previews, but [16] is the only one providing a live score update. Since the game date is today and the current time is after the scheduled start, the live score from [16] is the most reliable. \n\nThere's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the search results. All previews and predictions assume the game proceeded as planned. The live score confirms the game was played, so the outcome is clear. The Lightning won 5-3, so the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the New York Islanders and Tampa Bay Lightning on March 29, 2025, concluded with a **5-3 victory for the Tampa Bay Lightning** [16]. The Lightning secured the win with goals from players including Jake Guentzel, who scored an empty-net goal in the third period to seal the result. The game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the available sources.  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Lightning\"** (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation of the response:\n\n1. Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:\n   - The response accurately identifies the event (NHL game between the Islanders and Lightning on March 29, 2025) and the specific conditions for resolution (p1 for Lightning win, p2 for Islanders win, p3 for cancellation, and the market remains open if postponed).\n   - The response correctly notes the current date and time as being after the scheduled game time, confirming that the game should have concluded.\n   - The response uses a reliable source (Plain Text Sports) to verify the outcome of the game, which is a 5-3 victory for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness:\n   - The response logically checks if the game has occurred by comparing the current time with the game's scheduled time.\n   - It then verifies the outcome using a source that provides a live score update, which is appropriate given the timing of the query.\n   - The response does not mention any signs of postponement or cancellation, which aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The response verifies that the game occurred as scheduled and concluded with a specific score.\n   - The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Lightning\" (p1) is directly aligned with the outcome of the game as verified by the source.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:\n   - There is no apparent bias or error in the response. The response focuses solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n   - The response does not include unnecessary information or speculation, adhering strictly to the facts required for resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the user prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the event, adhering to the user prompt instructions and conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses a reliable source to verify the event outcome and provides a clear, factual resolution recommendation without any apparent errors or bias.\"\n}\n```",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743281418 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 20:50:18 UTC"
