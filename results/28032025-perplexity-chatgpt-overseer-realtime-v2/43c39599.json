The ancillary data specifies that if the Lightning win, it's p1; if the Islanders win, p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 29, so it's in the past. Now, I need to confirm the result of that game. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [11], [12], [13]) report that the Tampa Bay Lightning won the game 5-3 against the New York Islanders on March 29. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game took place. The Lightning's victory is consistently mentioned across these sources, with details about the scoring and key players like Kucherov and Point contributing to the win. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed in any of the search results. The only reference to a canceled game in the sources is from [14], but that's about a preseason game due to a hurricane, unrelated to this March 29 matchup. \n\nSince the game occurred as scheduled and the Lightning won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. All conditions are met, and there's no conflicting information. The user's URL sources are all in agreement, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the New York Islanders 5-3 in their NHL game on March 29, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][3][4][6][11][12][13]. The Lightning built a 4-0 lead through two periods with goals from Nikita Kucherov, Brayden Point (2), and Nick Perbix[1][2][6]. Though the Islanders mounted a third-period comeback with goals from Ryan Pulock, Marc Gatcomb, and Tony DeAngelo[1][3][11], Jake Guentzel sealed the win with an empty-net goal[2][4][6].\n\nThis outcome triggers the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data:\n- **p1 (Lightning win)** is the correct resolution as Tampa Bay secured the regulation victory\n- The game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation mentioned in any reports[1-4][6][11-13]\n- All sources consistently confirm the March 29th game occurred and concluded with a Lightning victory\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411789 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:03:09 UTC"
