The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the MLB game between the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Yankees on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Yankees, p2 is Brewers, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's status. The search results mention the game was scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 1:35 PM EDT. According to source [1], the game was played as planned. The highlights from sources [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], and [8] all discuss the game's events, indicating it was completed. \n\nNext, checking if the game was postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game happening on March 30, so no postponement or cancellation. The user's current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event has occurred.\n\nNow, determining the official outcome. Source [4] states the Yankees won 12-3, securing a series sweep. Source [6] confirms the Yankees' 12-3 victory with four home runs, and source [8] provides the final score of 12-3. The box score from [5] also lists the Yankees as the winning team with a 12-3 score. \n\nSince the game was completed and the official result from MLB (as per the sources) is a Yankees win, the resolution should be p1. There's no mention of the game being suspended or ending in a tie. All conditions for resolving to p1 are met.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Yankees defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 12-3 on March 30, 2025, completing a three-game series sweep. The game was played as scheduled at Yankee Stadium with no postponements or suspensions[1][4][6]. Marcus Stroman started for the Yankees, allowing three runs over 4.2 innings, while the bullpen combined for 4.1 scoreless frames[6]. New York's offense dominated with four home runs, including Aaron Judge's two-run blast in the first inning and Jazz Chisholm Jr.'s three-run shot in the seventh[6][7]. The Yankees set franchise records with 15 home runs through their first three games[6]. MLB's official box score confirms the 12-3 final score[5][8], and video evidence shows Ryan Yarbrough securing the final out[4]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.
