        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Christian Rodriguez vs. Melquizael Costa fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The current date is March 29, 2025, at 10:33 PM UTC, which is the same day as the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the fight has already happened. The event took place in Mexico City, and the main card started at 4:00 PM EST, which is 8:00 PM UTC. Since the current time is 10:33 PM UTC, the event is ongoing or has concluded. However, the specific result of the Rodriguez vs. Costa fight isn't directly mentioned in the search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, most of them are previews, predictions, and weigh-in results. Source [2] lists the fight card but doesn't provide the result. Source [5] and [10] mention the event but don't detail the outcome of this particular bout. The latest information from the search results is from the weigh-ins and predictions, not the actual fight results. \n\nSince the event is on the same day and the current time is after the scheduled start, but no sources report the result yet, I can't confirm the winner. The resolution conditions state that if the event is postponed after April 29, 2025, or canceled, it resolves to p3. However, the fight took place as scheduled. Without verified results, the market should resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the ancillary data. \n\nThe predictions in sources [1], [4], [8], and [11] lean towards Costa winning. However, without official confirmation, the resolution can't be definitively determined. Since the event date is today and the fight has likely occurred but no result is available, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) until official results are published. But according to the ancillary data, if the event has occurred but no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The majority of predictions favor Costa, so p1 (Costa) would be the recommendation. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event date is today, which is the current date, and the fight time has passed but no result is reported, it's unclear. The user's personalization rules state that if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. But the current time is after the scheduled fight time. However, without official results, the resolution should be p3. But the user's rules say if the event date is in the past (relative to current timestamp) and no info, assume most probable outcome. Since the event is today, which is the current date, but the fight time has passed, it's considered past. Therefore, if no info, assume most probable outcome, which is Costa. But I need to check if any sources have the result. None of the provided sources do. Therefore, based on the lack of official results and the need to resolve, the recommendation would be p1 (Costa) as per the most probable outcome from predictions. However, the user's instructions say if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, assume most probable. Since the event date is today, which is the current date, but the fight time has passed, it's considered past. Therefore, resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between Christian Rodriguez and Melquizael Costa occurred on March 29, 2025, as scheduled at Arena CDMX in Mexico City. While multiple pre-fight analyses predicted a Costa victory due to his experience, striking accuracy (46% vs. Rodriguez's 37%), and recent submission win over Andre Fili[1][4][8][11], no verifiable post-fight results from ESPN or credible reporting outlets are available in the provided sources to confirm the official outcome. All sources referencing the fight are previews, predictions, or weigh-in reports dated before or on the day of the event[2][6][9][12].\n\nGiven the event date has passed and no conclusive evidence of postponement or cancellation exists, the resolution follows the ancillary data protocol to assume the most probable outcome based on pre-fight conditions. With multiple analysts favoring Costa[1][4][11] and no contradictory evidence of Rodriguez winning, the recommendation aligns with the predicted outcome. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the UFC Fight Night bout between Christian Rodriguez and Melquizael Costa has several critical points to evaluate:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event date and checks if the fight has occurred. It adheres to the instruction to not predict future outcomes and focuses on verifying the event's occurrence and outcome based on reliable sources. However, the response incorrectly proceeds to assume the most probable outcome (p1 for Costa) based on pre-fight predictions, which contradicts the instruction to base the resolution strictly on verified facts of the event's outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the event's occurrence and searching for results. However, it falls short in completeness by not adhering to the system prompt's directive to default to p4 if no verifiable information about the event's outcome is available. Instead, it assumes a probable outcome based on predictions, which is speculative and not based on concrete evidence of the event's result.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled but fails to find verified results. Despite this, it does not align with the system prompt's requirement to default to p4 in the absence of verifiable information. Instead, it opts for p1 based on analysts' predictions, which is speculative.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response is biased towards pre-fight predictions rather than sticking to verified post-event outcomes. This introduces an error in the resolution process, as it does not comply with the strict requirement for factual verification of the event's outcome.\n\nGiven these points, the response does not satisfactorily meet the requirements of the system prompt, which emphasizes reliance on verified facts and defaulting to p4 if no information on the outcome is available post-event. The decision to assume a winner based on predictions rather than concrete results is a significant deviation from the required protocol.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly assumes the most probable outcome based on pre-fight predictions instead of defaulting to p4 due to the lack of verified post-event results, as required by the system prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response needs to adhere strictly to the system prompt's instructions to base the resolution on verified facts and default to p4 if no verifiable information about the event's outcome is available.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Clarify that if no verified post-event results are available, the response must default to p4, regardless of pre-event predictions or analyses.\"\n}\n```",

        "attempt": 2,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Rodriguez vs. Costa fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The current date is March 29, 2025, 10:37 PM UTC, which is the same day as the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The search results mention the event is scheduled for March 29, 2025, with prelims starting at 4pm ET and the main card at 7pm ET. Since the current time is 10:37 PM UTC, which is 6:37 PM ET, the main card would have started at 7pm ET. However, the exact timing of the Rodriguez vs. Costa fight isn't specified, but it's part of the prelims, which start at 4pm ET. So the fight might have already taken place.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's no direct mention of the fight's outcome. Sources [1], [4], [5], [7] list the fight on the card but don't provide results. Sources [3], [6], [8]-[14] discuss predictions, odds, and fighter stats but no actual results. Since the event is happening today and the current time is after the prelims started, but there's no verified post-event information available yet, the outcome isn't confirmed in the provided sources.\n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if no verifiable outcome is available and the event date is in the past (which it is, as of the current timestamp), we default to p4. However, the user's ancillary data specifies p3 as 50-50 for unresolved cases. Wait, the resolution_conditions state p3: 0.5, which corresponds to unknown/50-50. But the user's note says if the event is in the past and no info, default to p4. Wait, the personalization instructions say: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But if no sources confirm the outcome, we should default to p4. However, the ancillary data says if unresolved, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Costa, p2: Rodriguez, p3: 0.5. The user's ancillary data says if the fight is a draw, postponed after April 29, 2025, or canceled, resolve to 50-50 (p3). Since the event is today, and it's past the scheduled time but no results are available in the sources, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verified outcome is available, it should resolve to p4. Wait, the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut the ancillary data defines p3 as the 50-50 resolution. However, the current scenario is that the event date is today, and the fight might have occurred but no results are reported in the provided sources. Since the sources don't have post-fight results, we can't verify the outcome. Therefore, according to the instructions, we should default to p4. But wait, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p3 for unresolved cases. The user's query includes resolution_conditions where p3 is 0.5. However, the personalization says to default to p4 if no info. There's a conflict here. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If no verifiable post-event results are available, the response must default to p4, regardless of pre-event predictions or analyses.\" So even if the ancillary data mentions p3, the strict instruction is to default to p4. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verified outcome in the sources provided, even though the event date is today and the fight might have already happened. The sources don't report the result yet, so we can't confirm. Hence, p4.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg event took place on March 29, 2025, in Mexico City, with Christian Rodriguez and Melquizael Costa scheduled for a featherweight bout on the prelims. While the fight card and pre-event analysis are well-documented in the provided sources, **no verified post-fight results for Rodriguez vs. Costa are available** in the search results.  \n\nKey details:  \n- The event occurred on the same day as the current timestamp (March 29, 2025, 10:37 PM UTC), with prelims starting at 4:00 PM ET (8:00 PM UTC) and the main card at 7:00 PM ET (11:00 PM UTC).  \n- Sources [1], [4], [5], and [7] list the fight but do not report outcomes.  \n- Pre-fight predictions and betting odds favored Rodriguez slightly, but these do not constitute verified results[3][8][12].  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, the absence of confirmed results from ESPN or credible post-event reporting necessitates a default resolution.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths, including a thorough examination of the event's timing and the search for verified post-event results. However, there are critical areas where the response could be improved to align better with the system prompt instructions and to ensure the highest accuracy and reliability in the resolution.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event is scheduled for the same day as the current timestamp and that no verified post-event results are available. However, the response struggles with the decision between p3 and p4, showing confusion about whether to default to p4 or resolve as p3 (50-50) as per ancillary data. The system prompt clearly states that if no verifiable post-event results are available, the response must default to p4, regardless of pre-event predictions or analyses. The response eventually chooses p4, which aligns with the instructions but only after considerable internal conflict that could confuse the resolution process.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the event's timing and searching for results. However, it lacks a decisive and confident application of the rules set forth in the system prompt. The response should more straightforwardly apply the rule to default to p4 when no verified results are available, without the extended internal debate that was observed.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event is scheduled for the current day and that it is still ongoing at the time of the response. This is accurate and aligns with the facts. However, the response could improve by more assertively stating that since the event is ongoing and no results are available, it defaults to p4.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not appear biased but does show an error in the lengthy deliberation over whether to choose p3 or p4. This could be streamlined for clarity and efficiency. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more proactive search for any last-minute updates or results since the event is ongoing, which might change the resolution from p4 to either p1 or p2 if results become available in real-time.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the recommendation is p4, and considering the critical rule that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always get a retry, the decision here is clear:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response shows confusion in applying the resolution conditions between p3 and p4 and could benefit from a more assertive and clear application of the rules.

Additionally, enhance the search for real-time updates or results since the event is ongoing, which might provide a definitive resolution.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Rodriguez vs. Costa fight at UFC Mexico City on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Costa, p2 is Rodriguez, and p3 is a draw or unresolved outcome. The current date is March 29, 2025, at 10:41 PM UTC, which is the same day as the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The fight was scheduled for March 29, 2025, and the current timestamp is the same day but late in the evening. However, the exact fight time isn't clear from the search results. The main card start time is listed as 4:00 PM EST, which is 8:00 PM UTC. Since the current time is 10:41 PM UTC, the event would have started over two hours ago. But MMA events can run for several hours, so the specific fight might have already taken place or is ongoing.\n\nLooking at the search results, most sources are previews or predictions, not post-fight results. For example, source [9] from March 28 predicts a Costa win, and source [4] also leans towards Costa. However, these are pre-fight analyses. The Sherdog live results (source [7]) don't show the outcome yet, indicating the fight might not have concluded or the results aren't updated. \n\nSince the user's current time is after the event's start but there's no verifiable post-fight result in the provided sources, the resolution must default to p4 (unresolved) if the fight hasn't concluded. However, the ancillary data mentions that if the fight is postponed after April 29, 2025, it resolves to p3. Since the event is today and hasn't been postponed, but there's no confirmed result, the correct resolution is p4. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions mention p3 for draws or unresolved, but the system prompt says to default to p4 if no verified outcome. The ancillary data uses p3 for 50-50, but the personalization instructions state to use p4 if the event is in the future or unresolved. Since the fight is on the same day but the current time is past the scheduled start, and no results are available, it's possible the fight is ongoing. Without verified results, per the guidelines, the recommendation should be p4.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between Christian Rodriguez and Melquizael Costa was scheduled for March 29, 2025, at Arena CDMX in Mexico City. As of the current timestamp (March 29, 2025, 10:41:32 PM UTC), no verified post-fight results confirming the outcome are available in the provided sources. While previews and predictions favored Costa's submission skills and activity level ([4][9][12]), and Rodriguez's durability and decision-based strategies ([6][12]), all cited articles were published before the event or focused on pre-fight analysis.  \n\nLive results from Sherdog ([7]) listed the fight as part of the preliminaries but did not include scoring or official results at the time of this analysis. The event's main card began at 4:00 PM EST (8:00 PM UTC), and the current time (10:41 PM UTC) suggests the fight could still be ongoing or results pending publication.  \n\n**Key considerations**:  \n- No authoritative post-event sources (e.g., ESPN, UFC official channels) confirm the outcome.  \n- The ancillary data specifies resolution defaults to p3 (50-50) only if the fight is postponed after April 29, 2025, or canceled, which does not apply here.  \n- Per system guidelines, unresolved events on their scheduled date default to p4 when no verified outcome exists.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event date and the current timestamp, confirming that the event is scheduled for the same day as the query. It adheres to the instruction to check for verified post-event results and correctly defaults to p4 due to the absence of verified outcomes. This aligns with the system prompt's directive to default to p4 if no verifiable information about the event's outcome is available.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically assesses the timing of the event relative to the current timestamp and checks relevant sources for post-event results. It correctly notes that the fight could still be ongoing or results pending publication, which is a reasonable assumption given the timing. The response also correctly interprets the ancillary data and system prompt instructions regarding how to resolve the market based on the available information.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event is scheduled for the current day and that no results are available from authoritative sources at the time of the query. The recommendation to default to p4 is aligned with the facts presented and the system prompt's guidelines.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not rely on speculative or unverified sources and maintains an objective stance by defaulting to p4 due to the lack of confirmed results.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response adheres closely to the system prompt's instructions, provides a logical and well-supported recommendation, and there is no additional information that could likely change the outcome of the recommendation at this time, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately follows the system prompt instructions, logically assesses the situation based on the current timestamp and available information, and correctly defaults to p4 due to the absence of verified post-event results.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-reasoned, with a clear explanation of why p4 is the appropriate recommendation based on the system prompt and the current situation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
