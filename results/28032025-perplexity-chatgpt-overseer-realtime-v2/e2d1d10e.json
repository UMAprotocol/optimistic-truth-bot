        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said the word \"Grok\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, and \"No\" (p1) if he didn't. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of the interview and any instances where Musk might have said \"Grok\". The key sources here are the search results that discuss the interview itself. \n\nLooking at the search results, the main sources about the interview are [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], and [17]. Let's go through each one. \n\nResult [1] is a transcript of the interview from YouTube. The detailed transcript doesn't mention \"Grok\" at all. Musk talks about DOGE, government efficiency, and other topics, but no reference to Grok. \n\nResult [3] from Axios mentions the interview and Musk's comments about the revolution in government, but again, no mention of Grok. \n\nResult [6] discusses Musk threatening to use government power against critics of Tesla during the interview. The transcript here also doesn't include the word \"Grok\". \n\nResult [7] from Patch.com covers the interview, focusing on government waste and fraud. No mention of Grok here either. \n\nResults [9] to [16] are about Grok, Musk's AI chatbot, but these are either about its features, controversies, or updates, not the specific interview in question. \n\nNotably, result [15] mentions Grok rebelling against Musk, but that's from March 30, after the interview date. Result [14] talks about Grok refusing to fact-check Musk, but again, not related to the Baier interview. \n\nNone of the search results that discuss the March 27 interview with Bret Baier include any instance where Musk said \"Grok\". All mentions of Grok in other contexts are from different dates or unrelated events. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that any usage of the term during the interview counts, but since none of the sources indicate that Musk mentioned Grok in that specific interview, the answer should be \"No\". \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nElon Musk did not mention the term \"Grok\" during his March 27, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News. The 45-minute discussion focused exclusively on Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), including topics like federal credit card reductions, Social Security fraud allegations, and deficit reduction goals[1][3][7]. While Musk referenced his broader business ventures like Tesla and SpaceX in passing[6][8], there were no instances of him discussing his xAI chatbot Grok or using the term in any context during this particular interview[1][3][6][7].\n\nMultiple transcripts and reports about the interview confirm this absence:\n- The YouTube transcript shows Musk discussing government efficiency measures but makes no mention of AI or Grok[1]\n- Axios' coverage of the interview focuses entirely on DOGE's work[3]\n- Fox Business' report about threatened Tesla critics contains no Grok references[6]\n- Patch's analysis of federal waste reduction similarly lacks any Grok discussion[7]\n\nThis aligns with the ancillary data's resolution conditions, which required verification through the interview's audio/video recording. As the full interview was released by the March 28 deadline without containing the term, the resolution criteria are satisfied[1][3][7].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response methodically checks the sources mentioned in the user prompt and confirms that Elon Musk did not say the word \"Grok\" during the interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The response provides a detailed analysis of various sources, including a YouTube transcript and reports from Axios, Fox Business, and Patch, none of which mention the term \"Grok\" in the context of the interview.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it systematically eliminates the possibility of the term being used by checking multiple reliable sources. The response also adheres strictly to the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data, confirming that the term \"Grok\" was not used in any context during the interview, leading to a recommendation of p1 (No).\n\nThe verification of the event is aligned with the facts as the response confirms that the interview did indeed take place and was released in its entirety by the specified deadline. The recommendation aligns with the resolution conditions that any usage of the term during the interview counts towards the resolution, and since it was not used, the market resolves to \"No.\"\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response uses the sources specified and does not introduce unrelated information, maintaining focus on the event in question.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies that Elon Musk did not say 'Grok' during the specified interview, using multiple reliable sources. It adheres to the resolution conditions and system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses appropriate sources, and provides a clear and logical analysis leading to a correct resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412213 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:10:13 UTC",
