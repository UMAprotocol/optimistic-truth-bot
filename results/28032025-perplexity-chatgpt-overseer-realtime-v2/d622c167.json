The ancillary data specifies that if the Cavaliers win, it's p1; Clippers win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the game in question was yesterday. Checking the search results, multiple sources like [1], [4], [5], [9], and [13] mention the game on March 30 where the Cavaliers defeated the Clippers 127-122. \n\nNext, verify the final score and outcome. Sources [1] and [4] clearly state the Cavaliers won. Also, the box score in [4] shows the final score as Cavaliers 127, Clippers 122. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nSince the Cavaliers won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All sources agree on the outcome, so there's no conflicting information. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 127-122 in their March 30, 2025 matchup at Rocket Arena in Cleveland[1][4][5][9][13]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions where a Cavaliers victory corresponds to **p1**. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any verified sources[1][4][13].\n\nKey details:\n- **Final score**: Cavaliers 127, Clippers 122[1][4][5]\n- **Game date**: Played March 30, 2025 at 3:30 PM ET as scheduled[1][3][4]\n- **Key performers**: Jarrett Allen (25 pts/12 reb) and Donovan Mitchell (24 pts/12 reb) led Cleveland[4][9], while Norman Powell scored 34 for LA[4][9]\n- **Post-game records**: Cavaliers improved to 60-15, Clippers fell to 42-32[1][5]\n\nThe market resolves to **p1** as the Cavaliers won the contest outright per the defined terms. No evidence suggests the game was altered from its original scheduling parameters.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome is verified through multiple sources, as mentioned in the response ([1], [4], [5], [9], [13]). The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event occurred as scheduled and was neither postponed nor canceled, aligning with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and outcome of the event, then verifying these details through reliable sources. It correctly concludes that the market should resolve to p1 (Cavaliers win), as specified in the ancillary data. The response also provides additional details about key performers and post-game records, which, while not necessary for the resolution, enhance the completeness and context of the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using multiple sources. It aligns the recommendation (p1) directly with the facts as outlined in the user prompt and the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the required information to resolve the market and does not include unnecessary or irrelevant details.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the prompt instructions.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743408941 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:15:41 UTC"
