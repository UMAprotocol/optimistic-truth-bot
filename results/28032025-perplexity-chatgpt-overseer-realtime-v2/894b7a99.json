        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Ethereum's price on Binance ETHUSDT went up or down between March 27th and 28th at noon ET. The resolution depends on comparing the closing prices of the 1-minute candles at those specific times.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current date is March 28, 2025, 4:28 PM UTC. The event in question is the price comparison between March 27th and 28th at noon ET. Since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, noon ET on March 28th would be 16:00 UTC. The current time is 16:28 UTC, which is just after the cutoff. So the event has already occurred, and the data should be available.\n\nNext, I need to look at the provided sources to find the closing prices for the specified times. The search results include Binance's own pages. Source [3] and [4] are Binance's price prediction pages. Source [3] mentions the live price of Ethereum as $2,061.62 on March 26, 2025, and source [4] shows $2,045.18 on March 25, 2025. However, these dates don't match the target dates of March 27th and 28th. \n\nSource [6] is an article from FXStreet dated March 18, 2025, which mentions Ethereum consolidating below $2,000. But this is a week before the event dates, so it's not directly relevant. \n\nSource [5] includes candlestick data from Investing.com, but the dates listed are March 19, 2025, and others, which don't cover the required dates. Source [7] has a live price chart from Coinalyze, but the latest data there is from March 23, 2025. \n\nThe key here is that the resolution source is specifically Binance's ETHUSDT trading pair with 1-minute candles. The user provided a URL (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT) as the resolution source, but the search results don't include real-time data from that exact URL. However, the current time is past the event time, so the data should be available. \n\nSince the search results don't have the exact closing prices for March 27th and 28th at noon ET, I need to infer based on available data. The latest price mentioned in the sources is from March 26th at $2,061.62 and March 25th at $2,045.18. However, these are predictions and not actual closing prices on the specified dates. \n\nGiven that the event date is in the past and no sources contradict the outcome, the most probable outcome must be determined. Since the user's ancillary data defines p2 as \"Up\" if the March 28th close is higher than March 27th, and without specific data showing a decrease, but considering the general market trends from the sources (like price predictions and market sentiment), if there's no clear downward trend reported, it's safer to assume the price remained stable or increased slightly. However, without explicit data, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since the user's query requires comparing two specific times and the data isn't present, but the event has occurred, the system should default to p3 (50-50) if the prices are equal, but without data, it's unclear. However, the user's instructions state that if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. Given the lack of data, the correct recommendation is p4. Wait, but the event date is in the past. The current time is after the event. If the system can't find the data, it should resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market depends on comparing the closing prices of Binance's ETHUSDT 1-minute candles at 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) on March 27 and March 28, 2025. As of the current timestamp (March 28, 2025, 16:28 UTC), the event has already occurred, and the required data should be available.  \n\n**Key analysis:**  \n- The resolution source ([Binance ETHUSDT chart](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT)) explicitly defines the comparison window, but **no direct price data for these specific timestamps is provided in the search results**.  \n- Recent ETH price trends from March 18\u201326, 2025, show volatility between $1,895 and $2,061[1][3][4][6], but these do not cover the critical March 27\u201328 window.  \n- Standard Chartered\u2019s revised 2025 price target of $4,000[6] and Binance\u2019s automated predictions[3][4] suggest longer-term bullish sentiment but lack granularity for intraday comparisons.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWithout verifiable closing prices for the specified timestamps in the provided sources, the outcome cannot be definitively determined.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the Ethereum price movement on Binance between March 27 and March 28, 2025, has several critical points to evaluate:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the need to compare the closing prices of the Ethereum (ETHUSDT) 1-minute candles on Binance at specific times and dates. It acknowledges the correct source (Binance) and the specific URL provided by the user. However, the response fails to provide the exact closing prices for the specified times, which is crucial for resolving the market. The response also correctly notes that the event has already occurred and that the data should be available, aligning with the requirement to report on past events.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a logical approach by checking the current date and time and recognizing that the event has occurred. However, it falls short in obtaining the specific data required for a resolution. The reasoning about market trends and price predictions is irrelevant to the specific query about exact closing prices at specified times. The response ends with a recommendation of p4 (cannot resolve), which is cautious but not aligned with the possibility of obtaining the exact data needed.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not verify the exact closing prices for the specified timestamps, which is essential for resolving the query. The recommendation of p4 is based on the absence of specific data in the response, not on the impossibility of obtaining such data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The major error in the response is the failure to provide or obtain the exact closing prices from Binance for the specified times, despite acknowledging that this data should be available. The response also unnecessarily discusses general market trends and predictions, which do not contribute to resolving the specific query.\n\nGiven these points, the response needs improvement to directly address the user's query by obtaining and reporting the exact closing prices for ETHUSDT on Binance at the specified times. The logical reasoning should focus solely on this data rather than on broader market trends.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to provide the specific data required for resolution, despite correctly identifying the source and the nature of the query.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the closing prices of ETHUSDT on Binance at 12:00 ET on March 27 and March 28, 2025. The outcome depends on whether the price went up or down between those two times. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the exact closing prices. Let's go through each relevant source. \n\nLooking at result [4], it mentions that on March 28, 2025, at 00:06 AM UTC, Ethereum dropped below 2,000 USDT to 1,997.290039. But wait, 00:06 AM UTC on March 28 would be 8:06 PM ET on March 27 (since ET is UTC-4). That's not the 12:00 ET time specified, so this might not be directly relevant. \n\nResult [9] states that on March 28 at 11:26 AM UTC, ETH was at 1,883.02002 USDT. Converting 11:26 AM UTC to ET would be 7:26 AM ET, still not noon. \n\nResult [5] has a closing price of 1900.36 USDT on March 18 at 12:00, but that's an older date. \n\nResult [11] and [16] are price predictions. [11] lists a price of $1,916.18 for March 28, and [16] shows $1,998.64 for March 28, but these are predictions, not actual closing prices. \n\nResult [7] from March 24 mentions a current price of $2,095.04, but that's a few days before the target dates. \n\nResult [15] explains that Binance's daily candle closes at 00:00 UTC, which is 8:00 PM ET. However, the user is asking for 12:00 ET, which is 16:00 UTC. The 1-minute candle at 12:00 ET would be a specific minute, so the exact time conversion is crucial. \n\nSince the search results don't provide the exact closing prices at 12:00 ET on both dates, I can't definitively determine the outcome. The available data points are either from different times or are predictions. Without the precise 12:00 ET closing prices from Binance, the resolution can't be confirmed. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4, indicating insufficient data to resolve the market.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market depends on comparing the ETHUSDT closing prices on Binance at 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) for March 27 and March 28, 2025. Analysis of the provided search results reveals:\n\n- **March 27, 2025**: No direct data point exists for the 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) closing price. The closest relevant information shows ETH trading at **1,997.290039 USDT** at 00:06 UTC on March 28[4], which corresponds to **8:06 PM ET on March 27** (outside the required timeframe).\n\n- **March 28, 2025**: The price dropped to **1,883.02002 USDT** at 11:26 AM UTC[9] (7:26 AM ET), but no data exists for the 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) close. Price predictions for March 28 show conflicting estimates ranging from **$1,916.18[11]** to **$1,998.64[16]**, but these are forecasts rather than verified closing prices.\n\nKey limitations:\n1. No explicit 12:00 ET closing prices in any source\n2. Timezone conversions show available data points fall outside the required resolution window\n3. Binance's candle close occurs at 00:00 UTC (8:00 PM ET)[15], making 12:00 ET candles non-standard and harder to verify\n\nWithout verifiable closing prices at the exact specified times from Binance's ETHUSDT pair, the market cannot be definitively resolved. \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the resolution of the market depends on comparing the ETHUSDT closing prices on Binance at 12:00 ET for March 27 and March 28, 2025. The response adheres to the user prompt by focusing solely on the specified source (Binance) and the exact times mentioned. It correctly disregards irrelevant data points that do not match the specified times.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources and correctly concludes that none of the data points match the exact required times of 12:00 ET for the two specified dates. The reasoning behind dismissing predictions and data points outside the required timeframe is sound and aligns with the prompt requirements.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies that the available data does not meet the criteria set out in the user prompt, as it lacks the exact closing prices at the specified times. The recommendation of p4 (indicating insufficient data to resolve the market) is aligned with the facts presented and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response is focused and does not include unnecessary information. However, the response could potentially improve by attempting to access real-time or archived data directly from Binance or other reliable financial data services that might have the exact closing prices for the specified times, if such data is accessible.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response has logically and accurately processed the available information but still resulted in a p4 recommendation due to the lack of specific data, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately assessed the available information and concluded that the exact data needed to resolve the query is not available. Further attempts are unlikely to uncover the specific required data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response was thorough and adhered closely to the instructions, logically dismissing irrelevant data and focusing on the exact requirements of the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743179269 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-28 16:27:49 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease ensure that the response includes the exact closing prices for ETHUSDT on Binance at 12:00 ET on March 27 and March 28, 2025. Exclude any general market analysis or price predictions that do not directly provide this data.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response needs to focus on obtaining and verifying the exact closing prices from Binance for the specified timestamps. Unnecessary discussion of market trends and predictions should be eliminated, as they do not contribute to resolving the specific query.\n\n1. Dig deeper into available sources and data\n2. Be more critical of potentially unreliable sources\n3. Consider all interpretations of the query\n4. Provide more specific evidence for your recommendation\n5. Make sure your recommendation is fully justified by your analysis\n\nTry your best to find information that would lead to a definitive answer (p1/p2/p3) if possible, before defaulting to p4."
