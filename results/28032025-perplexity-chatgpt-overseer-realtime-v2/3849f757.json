The ancillary data specifies that if the Sabres win, it's p2 (Sabres), Capitals win is p1 (Capitals), postponed stays open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to determine who won the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] states the Sabres won 8-5. Source [2] and [5] also mention the Sabres' victory with the same score. Source [7] and [8] provide detailed play-by-play, including the final score of 8-5 in favor of Buffalo. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game happening on March 30, with detailed stats and player interviews, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the Sabres won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. All sources agree on the result, so there's no ambiguity. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres defeated the Washington Capitals 8-5 in their NHL game on March 30, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][5][7][8].

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Sabres vs. Capitals game) occurred on March 30, 2025, and the current date is March 31, 2025, which means the event is in the past. The response then verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all confirm that the Sabres won the game 8-5. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a Sabres win corresponds to p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled and finds none, confirming the game occurred as scheduled. It then concludes that the market should resolve to p2 based on the Sabres' victory, which is consistent with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The alignment of the recommendation (p2) with the facts (Sabres' victory) is correct and follows the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and system instructions, using verified sources to confirm the event's outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it accurately resolves the query based on the event's verified outcome and adheres to the specified resolution conditions. There is no need for a rerun or additional verification.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, providing a well-reasoned and fact-based resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410647 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:44:07 UTC",
