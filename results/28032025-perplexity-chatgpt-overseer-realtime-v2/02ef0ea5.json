        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for an NHL game between the Vegas Golden Knights and Chicago Blackhawks scheduled for March 28 at 8:30 PM ET. The current date provided is March 29, 2025, which is the day after the game was supposed to take place. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. Since the event date is in the past, I should look for verified results. The ancillary data specifies that if the Golden Knights win, it's p2; if the Blackhawks win, p1; postponed keeps it open, and canceled resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nI need to verify the outcome of the game. The user hasn't provided any specific sources or URLs, so I'll rely on general knowledge up to the current date. However, since the current date is March 29, 2025, and the game was on March 28, 2025, I should check if there's any available information about that specific game. \n\nAssuming the game took place, I need to determine the winner. If the Golden Knights won, the resolution is p2. If the Blackhawks won, it's p1. If the game was postponed, the market remains open. If canceled, it's p3. \n\nSince there's no specific data provided here, but the date is past, and assuming the game wasn't postponed or canceled, the most probable outcome would need to be inferred. However, without actual data, I can't definitively say. But given the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. If the teams' usual performance is considered, maybe Golden Knights are stronger, but that's speculative. However, the user's personalization instructions say if no info, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But without any sources, I might have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, no\u2014the personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's ancillary data. But if there's no info, maybe it's p3? Wait, the resolution conditions for canceled is p3 (0.5), but if the game happened and there's no info, perhaps it's p4. Wait, the instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, since the event date is past, and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the user hasn't provided any data on team strength, so maybe it's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the market should resolve to p4. Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nBut in this case, there's no information provided. So without any sources, how can I infer? The user's instructions say to use the provided search results, but in this case, there are none. Wait, the user didn't provide any search results. So perhaps the assistant should respond that there's no information available, leading to p4. But according to the personalization rules, if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, how? Maybe the correct answer is p4 because there's no verifiable information. Alternatively, if the event date is past and no info, maybe it's considered canceled, but that's not necessarily true. The instructions say if canceled, resolve to p3. But if the game was played and no info, it's unclear.\n\nWait, the current timestamp is March 29, 2025, 3:08 AM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (March 28, 8:30 PM ET, which is March 29, 00:30 UTC). So the game should have happened. If there's no information about postponement or cancellation, but the date has passed, and no results are found, perhaps the resolution is p4. However, according to the personalization rules: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" But without any data, how to determine the most probable outcome? The ancillary data doesn't provide probabilities, just conditions. So in the absence of information, perhaps the resolution is p4. But the instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But if there's no way to determine, then p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\" Since there's no available information (no search results provided), the assistant can't infer the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Vegas Golden Knights and Chicago Blackhawks was scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET. As of the current timestamp (March 29, 2025, 3:08:21 UTC), the event date has passed. However, no verifiable information about the game's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided in the available sources. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if the outcome cannot be confirmed due to lack of verifiable data, the recommendation defaults to **p4** (\"unknown/50-50\" resolution). There is no evidence to confirm whether the game occurred as planned, was postponed, or resulted in a specific team's victory.\n\nrecommendation: p4",

It adheres to the instruction to check for verifiable outcomes and correctly identifies the lack of available information about the game's outcome, postponement, or cancellation.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a logical approach by considering the possible outcomes based on the ancillary data provided. However, the internal reasoning process is somewhat circular and repetitive, reflecting uncertainty about how to proceed without verifiable data. The response eventually concludes that the recommendation should default to p4 due to the absence of information, which aligns with the system prompt instructions that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, the query should be resolved based on the most probable outcome or default to p4.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly notes that no verifiable information is available about the event's outcome. It aligns with the system prompt's directive to default to p4 in such cases, which is a safe and conservative approach given the lack of data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The main issue is the lack of available information to make a more definitive resolution. The response could potentially improve by explicitly stating any attempts made to search for information or by clarifying that all known sources have been checked.\n\nGiven the critical rule that a first attempt recommendation of p4 must always result in a retry, and considering the potential for improving the search strategy or verification efforts:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt p4 recommendations must always be retried to explore potential improvements in search strategies or verification efforts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response logically follows the system prompt instructions but is somewhat circular and repetitive in reasoning.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Vegas Golden Knights vs. Chicago Blackhawks game scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Blackhawks win, p2 for Golden Knights win, p3 if canceled, and p4 if the event hasn't occurred yet. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 29, 2025, 3:10 AM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. So the event should have already happened. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention a game on February 28, 2025, where the Golden Knights won 7-5 against the Blackhawks (sources 1, 3, 5, 7, 12). However, the query is about a game scheduled for March 28, 2025. \n\nSearch result 8 from Plain Text Sports (source 8) shows a final score of Golden Knights 5, Blackhawks 3 on March 28, 2025. This directly matches the date in the query. Other sources (2, 4, 6) are predictions or previews for the March 28 game, but source 8 provides the actual result. \n\nAdditionally, source 5 mentions a previous meeting on February 27 (which aligns with the February 28 game in other sources) and discusses the upcoming March 28 game, but the key confirmation comes from source 8's box score. \n\nThere's a discrepancy in some sources referring to a February game, but the March 28 game is confirmed in source 8. Therefore, the Golden Knights won the March 28 game 5-3, leading to a resolution of p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Vegas Golden Knights defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 5-3 in the NHL game played on March 28, 2025, at United Center. The final score reflected a competitive matchup where Vegas maintained control despite Chicago's efforts to close the gap. Key goals came from Mark Stone, Victor Olofsson, and others, with the Golden Knights securing their fourth consecutive win[8]. \n\nThis outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided, where a Golden Knights victory corresponds to **p2**. The game occurred as scheduled, and no evidence suggests postponement or cancellation. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and verification of event alignment with the recommendation. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (NHL game between the Vegas Golden Knights and the Chicago Blackhawks on March 28, 2025) and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The response uses a source that confirms the Golden Knights won the game 5-3, which aligns with the resolution condition p2 for a Golden Knights win.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response effectively distinguishes between the game in question and another game that occurred a month earlier, which could potentially confuse the resolution. It identifies and dismisses irrelevant predictions and focuses on the actual result from a reliable source. This demonstrates a logical and methodical approach to resolving the query based on the event's outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through a credible source (source 8) and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the factual outcome of the event. This is crucial in meeting the oracle's requirement to base decisions on verified facts.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit any noticeable bias or errors. It critically evaluates the sources, focusing on the one that provides the actual results, and avoids the common pitfall of relying on predictive or irrelevant sources. However, the response could enhance its credibility by briefly mentioning the efforts made to verify the reliability of source 8 or by checking additional sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring no conflicting reports exist.\n\nDecision:\nGiven the analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the necessary criteria of accuracy, logical reasoning, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no indication of missing critical information or misinterpretation of the facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies and verifies the outcome of the NHL game according to the specified conditions, providing a well-reasoned and factual resolution.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified information to resolve the query.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743217701 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 03:08:21 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease ensure to exhaust all available and reliable sources to verify the outcome of the NHL game scheduled for March 28, 2025, between the Vegas Golden Knights and Chicago Blackhawks. If no information is found, confirm that all known sports news databases and official NHL records have been checked."
