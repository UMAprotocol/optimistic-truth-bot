The ancillary data specifies that if the team is eliminated, the market resolves to \"No\". The current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the Elite Eight games but before the Final Four. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to see if Houston advanced. Looking at the sources, especially [1], [7], [8], and [10], they all mention Houston's victory over Tennessee in the Elite Eight on March 30, 2025. For example, source [1] states that Houston clinched their seventh trip to the Final Four after defeating Tennessee. Similarly, source [7] confirms the 69-50 win, and source [8] mentions they secured a spot in the Final Four. \n\nThe Final Four is scheduled for April 5, 2025, as per sources [3] and [5], with Houston facing Duke. Since the current date is March 31, the event hasn't happened yet, but Houston has already advanced past the Elite Eight. The resolution conditions state that if the team advances, it's a \"Yes\". However, the market resolution is based on whether they made it to the Final Four, which they have, according to the sources. \n\nWait, but the query mentions that if the Final Four isn't determined by May 31, it resolves to \"No\". But here, the Final Four has been determined, and Houston is in it. So the answer should be \"Yes\", which corresponds to p2. The sources are all consistent in confirming Houston's advancement, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe University of Houston men's basketball team has officially advanced to the 2025 NCAA March Madness Final Four. The Cougars secured their spot by defeating Tennessee 69-50 in the Elite Eight on March 30, 2025[1][7][8][10]. This marks Houston's seventh Final Four appearance in program history and their first since 2021[1][8]. The team will face Duke in the national semifinals on April 5, 2025, at the Alamodome in San Antonio[1][3][5].\n\nMultiple authoritative sources including CBS Sports, Associated Press, and official university communications confirm Houston's advancement[1][7][8][10]. The NCAA tournament bracket shows Houston as one of the four remaining teams competing for the national championship[3][5]. As the Final Four participants have been determined and Houston is explicitly listed among them, the market resolution criteria are fully satisfied.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the University of Houston has advanced to the 2025 NCAA March Madness Final Four, which is the specific event in question according to the user prompt. The response uses multiple sources to confirm that Houston defeated Tennessee in the Elite Eight and has secured a spot in the Final Four. This aligns well with the user prompt's requirement to use verified facts and official information from the NCAA.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the information that Houston's advancement to the Final Four meets the market resolution criteria of a \"Yes\" outcome. It correctly notes that the Final Four teams have been determined before the cutoff date of May 31, 2025, and thus, the market should resolve to \"Yes\". The reasoning is sound and follows the logical steps required by the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event of Houston's advancement using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts presented and the conditions outlined in the ancillary data. The response ensures that the event is not only verified but also relevant to the resolution conditions specified.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating into predictions or irrelevant details.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411315 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:55:15 UTC"
