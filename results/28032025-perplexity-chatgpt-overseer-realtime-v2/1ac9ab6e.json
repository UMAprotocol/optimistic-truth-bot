The ancillary data specifies that if the Raptors win, it's p2; if the 76ers win, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, resolve 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025, so the game date has already passed. The next step is to verify the game's result. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the outcome. \n\nSearch result [1] from CBS Sports states that the Raptors won 127-109, sending the 76ers to their eighth straight loss. Similarly, [4] from ESPN AU and [6] from ESPN both confirm the Raptors' victory with the same score. The YouTube video in [5] also refers to the game highlights, though the transcript snippets align with the Raptors leading and winning. \n\nAdditionally, the game log in [8] shows the Raptors have a historical edge over the 76ers, but the specific game in question is covered in the recent results. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. \n\nSince the game occurred on March 30, which is before the current date, and multiple reliable sources confirm the Raptors' win, the market should resolve to p2 (Raptors). No conflicting information or indications of cancellation/postponement are present.\n</think>\n\nThe Toronto Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 127-109 on March 30, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][4][6]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Raptors 127, 76ers 109[4][6]\n- R.J. Barrett led Toronto with 31 points[1][4]\n- This marked Philadelphia's eighth consecutive loss[1][4]\n\nBased on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market should resolve to \"Raptors\".\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event's occurrence and outcome without predicting or assuming results not supported by evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It provides a detailed account of the game's result, including the final score and key players, which supports the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through credible sources like CBS Sports and ESPN. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Raptors\" (p2) aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p2 corresponds to a Raptors win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information or assumptions beyond what is required to resolve the query.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409806 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:30:06 UTC",
