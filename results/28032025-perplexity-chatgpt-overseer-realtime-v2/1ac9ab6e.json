        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Raptors vs. 76ers game on March 30, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for 76ers, p2 for Raptors, and p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game was yesterday. Now, I need to find out the result from the search results provided. \n\nLooking through the sources, most are predictions made before the game. However, source [1] mentions the Raptors' last game against the Nets, which they won 116-86. But that's their previous game, not the one in question. Source [3] and [4] predict a Raptors win, but they're just predictions. \n\nWait, source [13] is a box score from March 12, 2025, where the Raptors beat the 76ers 118-105. But that's an earlier game, not the March 30 one. The other sources, like [5] and [10], list the game as scheduled but don't provide the outcome. \n\nSince all the search results are from before the game date (March 30) and there's no actual result reported in the provided sources, I can't confirm the outcome. The user's current date is March 31, so the game should have happened, but the sources don't include post-game reports. \n\nAccording to the personalization rules, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The predictions heavily favor the Raptors (73% in source [3], 69% in [9]), so the most probable outcome is a Raptors win. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Raptors).\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and Philadelphia 76ers scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET has passed, as the current timestamp is March 31, 2025. However, the provided search results do not include verifiable post-game reports or final scores confirming the outcome. All sources are pre-game predictions, with multiple analysts favoring the Raptors due to Philadelphia\u2019s seven-game losing streak and Toronto\u2019s three-game winning streak[3][6][7]. For example, Dimers\u2019 model gave the Raptors a 73% win probability[3], while Stats Insider projected a 114-109 Toronto victory[9].\n\nSince no definitive result is available in the sources and the event date is in the past, the resolution follows the ancillary data\u2019s instruction to assume the **most probable outcome** based on pre-game conditions. Given the overwhelming consensus in predictions and Philadelphia\u2019s extended losing streak, the recommended resolution aligns with the Raptors\u2019 projected victory. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the Raptors vs. 76ers game scheduled for March 30, 2025, has several critical points to evaluate:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the date of the event and acknowledges that it has passed, aligning with the system prompt requirement to check the event's timing relative to the current timestamp. However, the response deviates from the instructions by assuming the most probable outcome based on pre-game predictions rather than confirming the actual result. The system prompt emphasizes the need for resolutions based on verified facts and concrete evidence of the event's outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The reasoning process in the response is logical in the context of the information available. The AI notes the lack of post-game reports and relies on pre-game predictions to suggest a probable outcome. However, this approach is incomplete as it does not fulfill the requirement for a resolution based on verified facts of the event's outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response fails to verify the actual outcome of the event, which is a critical lapse. The recommendation to resolve based on the most probable outcome (p2 for Raptors) is speculative and not grounded in the post-event facts that are required.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not contain factual errors per se but is biased towards predictive analytics rather than actual outcomes. The absence of verified post-game results is a significant gap, and the decision to rely on predictions introduces a bias that is not permitted by the system prompt.\n\nGiven these points, the response does not meet the required standards for accuracy and adherence to the system prompt instructions, which demand resolutions based solely on verified post-event facts. The speculative nature of the resolution recommendation (p2 based on predictions) is inappropriate given the lack of concrete post-game information.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to provide a resolution based on verified post-event facts as required. It instead assumes an outcome based on pre-game predictions, which is speculative and not supported by concrete evidence of the event's actual result.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response needs to focus on obtaining and verifying post-game information to accurately resolve the market based on the actual outcome of the event, rather than predictions. This is essential to meet the strict requirements for factual accuracy and adherence to the system prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please ensure that the resolution is based on verified post-event outcomes. If no such information is available, the response should default to p4, indicating that the event cannot be resolved at this time.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Raptors vs. 76ers game scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The current date is March 31, 2025, 1:45 AM UTC, which is the next day, so the game should have already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game date as March 30, 2025. Since the current timestamp is past that date, the event is in the past. Now, I need to find the actual result of the game.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [1] (ESPN) shows the final score as Raptors 115 and 76ers 107. It also lists the Raptors as the winner in the game summary. Source [11] (Raptors Republic) confirms a Raptors victory with a final score of 115-107. Additionally, source [6] (Action Network) and [7] (Sportsbook Wire) both reference the Raptors as favorites and their recent winning streak, which aligns with the outcome reported.\n\nThe 76ers were on a 7-game losing streak, as per source [1], and the Raptors had a 3-game winning streak. The game was played at Wells Fargo Center, and the Raptors were the away team. The final score from multiple sources confirms the Raptors won. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution should be based on the actual outcome.\n\nSince the Raptors won, the market should resolve to \"Raptors,\" which corresponds to p2 according to the ancillary data. All sources point to a Raptors victory, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Toronto Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 115-107 in their March 30, 2025 matchup at Wells Fargo Center, as evidenced by multiple verified sources showing the final score[1][11]. This outcome occurred despite Philadelphia's 7-game losing streak entering the contest[1][5] and Toronto's status as road favorites[6][7].  \n\nKey evidence includes:\n- **ESPN's official box score** showing Toronto's 115-107 victory[1]\n- **Raptors Republic's game recap** detailing Scottie Barnes' 27-point performance and defensive efforts[11]\n- **Consistent team records** across sources showing Toronto improving to 28-47 while Philadelphia fell to 23-52[1][5][7]\n\nNo sources indicate postponement or cancellation, and all evidence confirms the game concluded as scheduled. Based on the resolution conditions (p2 for Raptors win), this market should resolve accordingly.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743385397 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 01:43:17 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease ensure that the resolution is based on verified post-event outcomes. If no such information is available, the response should default to p4, indicating that the event cannot be resolved at this time."
