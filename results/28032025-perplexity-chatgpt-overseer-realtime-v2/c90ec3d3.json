The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Mariners, p2 is Athletics, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and whether it was played as scheduled. The search results mention the game on March 28, 2025. From source [1], the Mariners lost 7-0 to the Athletics on March 29, but that's the day after. Wait, no, looking closer, the article from [1] is dated March 29 but refers to the game on March 28. The ESPN recap [5] also confirms the March 28 game with a 7-0 Athletics win. \n\nNext, check if the game was postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place. The box score [7] and recap [5] show the Athletics won 7-0. The official MLB outcome is crucial here. Since the game was completed and the Athletics won, the market should resolve to p2. \n\nI also need to ensure there were no suspensions or incomplete play. The game went the full 9 innings, as per the box score and recaps. No mentions of delays or suspensions. Therefore, the resolution is clear: Athletics won, so p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Oakland Athletics defeated the Seattle Mariners 7-0 in the March 28, 2025 MLB game at T-Mobile Park. The game was played to completion with no postponements, suspensions, or cancellations, as evidenced by multiple verified sources reporting the full 9-inning result[1][5][7].  \n\nKey details confirming the outcome:  \n- Athletics starter Jeffrey Springs pitched 6 scoreless innings with 9 strikeouts[1][5]  \n- Brent Rooker's 2-run HR opened scoring in the 5th inning[1][5]  \n- Oakland added 3 runs in the 7th and solo HRs from Max Muncy/Luis Ur\u00edas in late innings[1][5]  \n- MLB's official box score shows a 7-0 final with Oakland recording 12 hits vs Seattle's 5[7]  \n\nAs the game was completed according to MLB rules and the Athletics were declared the official winner, this market resolves to **p2** under the specified conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411093 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:51:33 UTC"
