The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the game between the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves based on the official MLB outcome, with p1 for Mariners, p2 for Athletics, and p3 for a tie or unresolved. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 28. The current date is March 29, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game. \n\nSearch result [4] from CBS Sports clearly states that the Athletics won 6-0 on March 28. It mentions Brent Rooker and Max Muncy homering, and Jeffrey Springs pitching six scoreless innings. The Mariners' starter was Luis Castillo, who took the loss. This is a direct report of the game's outcome.\n\nOther sources like [6], [13], and [14] also reference the March 28 game. [6] is a prediction before the game, so it's not useful for the result. [13] and [14] confirm the Athletics' victory. [14] even lists the final score as 6-0 in favor of the Athletics. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that the official MLB outcome determines the result. Since multiple credible sources (CBS Sports, FOX Sports) report the Athletics won 6-0, the market should resolve to p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed, suspended, or tied. All indicators point to a completed game with a clear winner. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Oakland Athletics defeated the Seattle Mariners 6-0 on March 28, 2025, in a game that became official under MLB rules. Key factors included:\n\n- **Athletics' dominant pitching**: Jeffrey Springs threw six scoreless innings with nine strikeouts in his Oakland debut[4][14].\n- **Offensive breakout**: Brent Rooker hit a two-run HR while Max Muncy added a solo shot for his first MLB hit[4][14].\n- **Mariners' struggles**: Seattle went 1-6 with RISP and stranded multiple runners, including a critical seventh-inning threat[4].\n\nThe game was completed without suspension or postponement, meeting all MLB completion requirements. As the Athletics were declared the official winner by MLB standards, this market resolves accordingly.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743223938 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 04:52:18 UTC",
