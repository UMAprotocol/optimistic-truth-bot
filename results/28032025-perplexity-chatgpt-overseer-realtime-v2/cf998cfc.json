The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Blue Jays, p2 is Orioles, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 28) is in the past. According to the rules, if the event is in the past, I need to verify the outcome using reliable sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Source [1] from Baseball Almanac states the Blue Jays won 8-2. Source [4] from CBS Sports and [6] from ESPN also report the same score, with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Kevin Gausman leading the Blue Jays to victory. Additionally, the YouTube video highlights in [7] and the box score in [13] corroborate the 8-2 result. \n\nThe resolution conditions mention using the official MLB outcome. All sources agree the Blue Jays won, so the market should resolve to p1. There's no indication the game was postponed, suspended, or ended in a tie. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Baltimore Orioles 8-2 in the MLB game played on March 28, 2025, as scheduled. Multiple verified sources including official box scores[1][4][6], game recaps[1][4][6], and video highlights[7] confirm the Blue Jays' victory through a combination of strong pitching by Kevin Gausman (6 IP, 2 ER) and offensive contributions from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
