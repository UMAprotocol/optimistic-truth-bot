        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Musk using those terms. The search results provided include transcripts and summaries of the interview. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at result [3], it's about Musk's xAI merging with X. The transcript mentions \"artificial intelligence\" when discussing the valuation. But this is from CNBC, not the Baier interview, so it's irrelevant here.\n\nResult [5] includes a transcript snippet from the Baier interview. Musk talks about using AI to map the federal government's org chart. He says, \"We did an ontology of the full federal government using AI...\" So here, he uses \"AI\" directly. That's a clear instance.\n\nResult [8] has a longer transcript from the interview. At one point, Musk mentions \"improvements to the Treasury financial system\" and using AI to map the government structure. Again, \"AI\" is used. \n\nResult [11] is the full transcript of the interview as aired on Fox News. In the transcript, Musk states, \"We did an ontology of the full federal government using Ai...\" Here, \"Ai\" is written, which likely stands for \"AI\". This counts as a usage.\n\nResult [15] includes a part where Bret Baier asks, \"does that include ai or the system overall?\" and the response mentions fixing computer systems. However, the speaker here isn't Musk but another DOGE member. The user's query specifically tracks Musk's usage, so this doesn't count.\n\nOther results like [1], [2], [4], [6], [7], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14] don't mention Musk using \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" in the context of the Baier interview. \n\nSo, based on the transcripts from the actual interview (results [5], [8], [11]), Musk did use \"AI\" at least once. The pluralization or possessive forms aren't an issue here, and the context doesn't matter per the query's rules. The interview was released by the deadline, so the condition is met. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nElon Musk used the term \"AI\" during his March 27, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News' *Special Report*. In the interview, Musk explicitly stated:  \n**\"We did an ontology of the full federal government using AI and brute force to map out 16,000 boxes on the federal government org chart\"** [5][8][11].  \n\nThis satisfies the resolution condition requiring usage of \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" in any context. The interview was released by the March 28 deadline, and no cancellations were reported.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. The response effectively analyzed the user's query regarding whether Elon Musk mentioned \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The AI provided a detailed examination of various sources, specifically focusing on the transcripts that are relevant to the interview in question.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies instances from the interview where Elon Musk used the term \"AI.\" It adheres to the user prompt's requirement to resolve the market based on Musk's usage of the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" in any context. The AI also correctly disregards mentions by other speakers, aligning with the prompt's specification to track only Musk's usage.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It examines multiple sources and correctly identifies the relevant ones, disregarding irrelevant information. The response is comprehensive, covering all necessary aspects to make an informed resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms that the interview occurred as scheduled and was released by the deadline. It verifies the use of the term \"AI\" by Elon Musk during the interview, which meets the conditions set forth for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI effectively uses the provided sources to substantiate its findings.\n\nGiven the thorough analysis and adherence to the prompt requirements, the response is satisfactory and reliable for resolving the query. The recommendation of \"p2\" (Yes) is well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user's query, adhering to the system prompt instructions and effectively using the provided sources to substantiate the resolution.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and logically sound, with a clear and thorough analysis of the relevant sources.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743222963 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 04:36:03 UTC",
