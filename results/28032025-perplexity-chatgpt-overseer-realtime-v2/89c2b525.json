        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said the word \"Starlink\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term was used in any form, including pluralization or possessive, but not other forms. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of the interview. The user provided several sources. Let's look through them. \n\nSearch result [4] is a transcript of the interview. In the transcript, Musk says: \"Given the critical safety issues, SpaceX signed a loan agreement with L3Harris, providing Starlink kits and service free of charge for an initial testing period.\" Here, he clearly uses the term \"Starlink.\" \n\nAnother source, [8], which is a YouTube video summary, also mentions Musk discussing Starlink in the interview. Additionally, [5] and [2] confirm the interview took place as scheduled. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that any usage of \"Starlink\" counts, regardless of context. Since Musk used the exact term in the interview, the condition for \"Yes\" (p2) is met. There's no indication the interview was canceled or unreleased by the deadline. Therefore, the resolution should be p2.\n</think>\n\nElon Musk did use the term \"Starlink\" during his March 27, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News' *Special Report*. In the interview transcript[4], Musk explicitly stated:  \n*\"Given the critical safety issues, SpaceX signed a loan agreement with L3Harris, providing **Starlink** kits and service free of charge for an initial testing period.\"*  \n\nThis satisfies the resolution condition requiring any usage of the term \"Starlink\" (including its possessive/plural forms) during the interview. The interview aired in full by the March 28 deadline[5][8], and no cancellation occurred.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. The response effectively verifies the occurrence of the event (Elon Musk's interview with Bret Baier) and confirms that the term \"Starlink\" was mentioned by Elon Musk during the interview. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the event took place and that the term was used, aligning with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it directly addresses the query by confirming the use of the term \"Starlink\" and verifying that the interview was not canceled or incomplete by the specified deadline. The response also correctly identifies that any usage of the term \"Starlink,\" including pluralization or possessive forms, counts toward the resolution of the market, which is consistent with the user prompt's conditions.\n\nThe response does not exhibit any noticeable bias or errors. It relies on the provided sources and adheres strictly to the facts as required. The recommendation of p2 (Yes) is well-supported by the evidence presented in the response, indicating that the term \"Starlink\" was indeed mentioned during the interview.\n\nThere is no missing information that would affect the resolution of this query. The response adequately covers all necessary aspects to provide a confident and accurate resolution based on the conditions set forth in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the occurrence of the event and the use of the term 'Starlink' as per the user prompt conditions. It is complete, logically sound, and adheres to the instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event and the specific term usage, aligning perfectly with the resolution conditions. No improvements are necessary.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743222242 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 04:24:02 UTC",
