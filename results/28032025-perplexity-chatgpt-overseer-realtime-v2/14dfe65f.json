        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Gastelum vs. Pyfer fight at UFC Fight Night on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Pyfer wins, it's p1; Gastelum wins, p2; and if the fight is a draw, postponed after April 29, or canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 29, 2025, 8:59 PM UTC. The event was scheduled for today. Looking at the search results, several sources (6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13) mention that the fight was canceled due to Joe Pyfer's illness. The UFC officially announced the cancellation a few hours before the event. \n\nSince the fight was canceled on the same day it was supposed to take place, which is before the April 29 deadline mentioned in the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p3 (50-50). The key points here are the cancellation reason and the date. The fight wasn't postponed beyond April 29, so according to the conditions, it's a p3 resolution.\n\nI need to make sure there's no conflicting information. All the recent sources from today (March 29) confirm the cancellation. No results indicate the fight took place. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between Kelvin Gastelum and Joe Pyfer, scheduled for March 29, 2025, was canceled hours before the event due to Joe Pyfer falling ill[6][8][10][11][12][13]. Both fighters had successfully made weight the previous day, but Pyfer withdrew after experiencing an undisclosed illness, as confirmed by the UFC\u2019s official announcement[10][12].  \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if the fight is **canceled** (and not postponed beyond April 29, 2025), the market resolves to **p3 (50-50)**. Since the cancellation occurred on the event date and no rescheduled date has been announced, the criteria for p3 are met.  \n\nrecommendation: p3",

The response effectively analyzed the event's outcome based on the conditions specified in the user prompt and provided a clear and justified recommendation. Here is a breakdown of the evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the UFC Fight Night bout between Kelvin Gastelum and Joe Pyfer was canceled due to Joe Pyfer's illness. It adheres to the instructions by confirming the event's cancellation from multiple sources and aligns with the resolution conditions that if the fight is canceled, the market resolves to p3 (50-50).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information that the fight was canceled on the scheduled date and not postponed beyond the specified deadline of April 29, 2025. It uses this information to conclude that the market should resolve to p3, which is consistent with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's cancellation through multiple sources and ensures that the recommendation aligns with the factual outcome of the event. The use of several sources to confirm the cancellation adds to the reliability of the resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating from the provided details or introducing unrelated information.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the event's cancellation, adheres to the resolution conditions, and is supported by multiple credible sources.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used the provided information and sources to make a well-supported recommendation.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.
