        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the NHL game between the Utah Hockey Club and the Florida Panthers on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, it's p2; if Panthers win, p1; postponed keeps it open, and canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 29, 2025, 1:40 AM UTC, and the game was scheduled for March 28, 7:00 PM ET, which is March 29, 00:00 UTC. So the game should have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, most sources are previews or predictions (like sources 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14) that talk about the upcoming game, expected lineups, and predictions. However, source 1 is a box score from FOX Sports dated March 28, 2025, which lists the game as \"Utah Hockey Club vs. Florida Panthers: Mar 28, 2025\" and shows team stats and leaders. The box score mentions Sergachev scoring two goals in a 5-2 win over the Sabres, but that might be a different game since the Sabres aren't involved here. Wait, the box score's details might be a mix-up. The leading scorers listed are for Utah and Florida, but the actual game result isn't clearly stated in the snippets provided. \n\nSource 2 is a YouTube video titled \"Florida Panthers vs Utah Hockey Club 3/28/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay,\" which seems to be a simulation or gameplay video, not the actual game. The transcript snippets describe gameplay moments but don't confirm the real-world outcome.\n\nOther sources like 3, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 provide game previews, how to watch, and predictions but no actual results. Source 10 is a box score for a softball game between Utah Tech and Pitt, irrelevant here. Source 11 and 14 have betting odds and stats but no result.\n\nSince all the search results are either previews, predictions, or unrelated content, there's no direct evidence of the game's outcome. The user's current date is March 29, 2025, so the game should have happened, but the provided sources don't include post-game reports. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions tie p1 to Panthers win, p2 to Utah. The predictions heavily favor Panthers (66% chance in source 4, 66.4% in source 8). However, without confirmed results, per the rules, if no verifiable info exists and the event date is past, we default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. But the user's personalization says if no info, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the user prompt's conditions. \n\nWait, the personalization section states: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context... If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nHere, the user's ancillary data defines the resolution based on who wins. Since the sources don't confirm the outcome, but the event date is past, we have to go with the most probable outcome as per the user's ancillary data. The Panthers were the heavy favorites, so the recommendation would be p1. However, the instructions also say if no verifiable info, and the event date is past, but the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nBut wait, the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nTherefore, despite the lack of post-game sources, the recommendation should be p1 (Panthers win) as the most probable outcome based on the ancillary data and predictions. However, the absence of actual result sources makes this uncertain. But per the rules, we proceed with the probable outcome. \n\nBut wait, the box score in source 1 might be for the actual game. Let me recheck source 1. The URL says \"utah-hockey-club-vs-florida-panthers-mar-28-2025-game-boxscore-42690\" and the title is \"Utah Hockey Club vs. Florida Panthers - March 28, 2025 - FOX Sports.\" The snippet includes team stats, leading scorers, but the detailed game result isn't clear. The mention of Sergachev scoring two goals in a 5-2 win over the Sabres seems unrelated (Sabres are a different team). Maybe that's a different game. The box score here might not show the actual score between Utah and Florida. \n\nSince none of the sources explicitly state the outcome, and all are previews or simulations, the correct approach is to check if the event occurred. Since the current date is after the game, but no results are found, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, the recommendation is p1 (Panthers) as they were the favorites. However, strictly by the rules, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date is past, but the user didn't specify postponement, we have to resolve based on the most probable. Hence, p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Utah Hockey Club and Florida Panthers scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET was analyzed for resolution based on verifiable outcomes. Despite extensive search results, **no conclusive post-game reports or final scores confirming the result were found** in the provided sources. All available information consists of pre-game predictions, odds, and previews, with the Panthers heavily favored (66% win probability[4][8][12]).  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, if the event date has passed (March 28, 2025) and no verifiable outcome exists, the resolution defaults to the **most probable outcome** as defined by ancillary data. Given the Panthers' strong statistical advantage and consensus predictions, the recommended resolution aligns with their projected victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the NHL game between Utah and the Florida Panthers has several strengths and weaknesses that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies the event date and checks it against the current timestamp to confirm that the event has occurred in the past.\n   - The response adheres to the instruction of not predicting future outcomes and focuses on verifying the event's occurrence and outcome based on available information.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The response demonstrates a thorough search for information regarding the game's outcome but fails to find conclusive evidence of the final score or result.\n   - The reasoning process is detailed, considering various sources, including previews, predictions, and a potentially incorrect box score. However, the response could be more concise and focused to avoid confusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response correctly notes that no verifiable post-game information is available from the sources it checked.\n   - It aligns with the user prompt's instruction to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided when no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The response could improve by more critically evaluating the relevance and reliability of the sources it mentions, particularly the box score that appears to be incorrect or unrelated.\n   - There is a slight contradiction in the reasoning process about whether to default to p4 or assume the most probable outcome. This needs clarification to ensure consistency with the user prompt instructions.\n\n5. **Decision and Recommendation:**\n   - The response concludes with a recommendation of p1 (Panthers win), based on the high probability of their victory as indicated by pre-game predictions and odds. This decision aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolving based on the most probable outcome when no direct evidence is available.\n\nGiven these points, the response is largely satisfactory but could benefit from a more streamlined and precise reasoning process to avoid potential confusion. The recommendation aligns with the user prompt's instructions under the conditions of lacking direct evidence and the event being in the past.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the lack of verifiable post-game information and correctly applies the user prompt's instructions to assume the most probable outcome based on pre-game predictions and conditions provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response could improve by streamlining the reasoning process and ensuring a more critical evaluation of the sources.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743212377 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 01:39:37 UTC",
