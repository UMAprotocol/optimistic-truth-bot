The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between Utah Hockey Club and the Florida Panthers on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, it's p2; if Panthers win, p1; postponed stays open, canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query mentions March 28 at 7:00 PM ET. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Now, checking the search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, all the game recaps (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) report that the Panthers won 2-1 in overtime. For example, source [1] states, \"Brad Marchand capped his Florida debut by setting up Sam Bennett's winner with 41.1 seconds left in overtime, and the Panthers defeated the Utah Hockey Club 2-1 on Friday night.\" This is consistent across multiple sources. \n\nThe resolution conditions say a Panthers win resolves to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, and all sources confirm the game was played as scheduled. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Utah Hockey Club and Florida Panthers on March 28, 2025, concluded with a **2-1 overtime victory for the Florida Panthers**[1][2][3][5][7][8]. Sam Bennett scored both goals for Florida, including the overtime winner assisted by Brad Marchand in his Panthers debut[1][5]. Utah's lone goal came from Sean Durzi in the third period[2][3].\n\nAll verified game reports confirm the Panthers secured the win within regulation overtime, with no indications of postponement or cancellation[1][2][3][5][7][8]. Based on the resolution conditions provided (Panthers win = p1), this outcome definitively resolves the market.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is that the Florida Panthers won. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition that a Panthers win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and occurrence of the event and then checking multiple sources to verify the outcome. The response provides a clear and concise summary of the game's key moments, which supports the resolution decision.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable and consistent. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is directly aligned with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response adequately covers the necessary details to make an informed resolution based on the user and system prompts.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743409870 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:31:10 UTC",
