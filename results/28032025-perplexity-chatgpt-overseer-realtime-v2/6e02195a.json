The ancillary data specifies that if the Hurricanes win, it's p1; if the Canadiens win, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the date. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game on March 28 is in the past. That means I need to determine the actual result. Looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [6], [7]) report that the Hurricanes won 4-1. For example, source [1] states the Hurricanes beat the Canadiens 4-1, and [6] confirms the same score. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game occurred as scheduled. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled, but all results discuss the game's details, like goals and player stats, indicating it was played. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (Hurricanes). No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Montreal Canadiens and Carolina Hurricanes on March 28, 2025, resulted in a **4-1 victory for the Carolina Hurricanes**[1][3][6][7]. Multiple sources confirm the Hurricanes secured their 10th win in 12 games, with key goals from Sebastian Aho, Taylor Hall, Jackson Blake, and Andrei Svechnikov[1][6][7]. The game was played as scheduled without postponement or cancellation[1][6][7].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Hurricanes 4, Canadiens 1[3][6]\n- Game occurred on March 28 at PNC Arena in Raleigh, NC[1][6]\n- No evidence of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][3][6][7]\n\nrecommendation: p1",

It accurately reports the outcome as a win for the Hurricanes with a score of 4-1, based on multiple sources. This aligns with the user prompt's requirement to resolve the market based on the game's outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event to confirm it is in the past and then proceeds to verify the outcome through reliable sources. It confirms that the game occurred as scheduled and provides the final score, which is essential for resolving the market. The response also checks for any possible postponements or cancellations, which is crucial for accurate resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring reliability. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Hurricanes win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response thoroughly covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query accurately.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411148 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:52:28 UTC",
