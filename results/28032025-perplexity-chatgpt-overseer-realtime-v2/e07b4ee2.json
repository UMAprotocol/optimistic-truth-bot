The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Raul Rosas Jr. vs. Vince Morales fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Rosas Jr. wins, it's p2; if Morales wins, p1; and p3 for a draw or unresolved. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the event has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the fight's outcome. Looking through the sources:\n\n- Source [1] lists the main card results, showing Raul Rosas Jr. def. Vince Morales via unanimous decision (29-28\u00d73).\n- Source [3] provides a detailed round-by-round breakdown, ending with the official result: Rosas Jr. by unanimous decision.\n- Source [7] mentions Rosas Jr. defeated Morales via unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28).\n- Source [9] and [10] both confirm the unanimous decision win for Rosas Jr.\n- Source [12] and [13] also state the unanimous decision with all judges scoring 29-28 in favor of Rosas Jr.\n\nAll relevant sources agree that Rosas Jr. won the fight by unanimous decision. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. Since the event date is in the past and multiple credible sources confirm Rosas Jr.'s victory, the market should resolve to p2 as per the resolution conditions.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between Raul Rosas Jr. and Vince Morales occurred on March 29, 2025, as scheduled. According to multiple verified sources, **Raul Rosas Jr. defeated Vince Morales via unanimous decision** (29-28 on all three judges' scorecards)[1][3][7][9][10][12][13]. The fight went the full three rounds, with Rosas Jr. controlling the grappling exchanges and surviving late submission attempts from Morales.  \n\nPer the ancillary data, the market resolves to **p2** (Rosas Jr. declared winner).  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the fight between Raul Rosas Jr. and Vince Morales took place on March 29, 2025, and that Raul Rosas Jr. was declared the winner by unanimous decision. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, which state that if Rosas Jr. wins, the market should resolve to \"p2\". The response correctly uses multiple sources to verify the outcome, ensuring reliability and adherence to the requirement for concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by checking multiple sources to confirm the fight's outcome. It provides a detailed account of the fight's result, mentioning the unanimous decision and the judges' scores, which supports the resolution recommendation. The response also correctly ignores any irrelevant outcomes like a draw or cancellation since there is no indication from the sources that such scenarios occurred.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and that the outcome is as described in multiple credible sources. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"p2\" is directly aligned with the verified facts and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, and logical consistency in the analysis, the response is satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412073 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:07:53 UTC"
