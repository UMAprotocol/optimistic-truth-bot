        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the UFC Fight Night bout between Raul Rosas Jr. and Vince Morales. The event took place on March 29, 2025, and the current date is March 30, 2025, so the fight has already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome of the fight. Let's go through each source. \n\nSearch result [1] is a prediction article from Pickswise, dated March 29, 2025. It predicts the fight might go the distance but doesn't report the actual result. \n\nResult [2] from Sportskeeda, also March 29, talks about Rosas Jr. potentially making history with a win but doesn't confirm the result. \n\nResult [3] is a pre-fight analysis from docsports.com, March 27, giving odds and stats but no result. \n\nResult [4] is the official UFC scorecards page, updated March 29. It lists the event but doesn't show the specific fight's result. \n\nResult [5] from Combat Press, dated March 19, lists the event's scheduled fights but doesn't have the results. \n\nResult [6] from Ringside24, March 29, provides fight times but no outcome. \n\nResult [7] from Fightmag, March 29, mentions the fighters but no result. \n\nResult [8] is the Wikipedia page for the event. The results table shows that Raul Rosas Jr. vs. Vince Morales is listed under the main card, but the result isn't filled in. Other fights have results, like Kevin Borjas defeating Ronaldo Rodr\u00edguez, but Rosas Jr. vs. Morales is still pending. \n\nResult [9] from Sportskeeda, March 29, is a live round-by-round update. The page mentions the main card starts at 7 PM ET, and the article was posted on the day of the event. However, the live updates don't include the actual result, just pre-fight analysis. \n\nResult [10] from MMA Junkie, March 29, has a prediction but no result. The expert picks Rosas Jr. to win by decision. \n\nResult [11] from VSIN, March 29, also predicts Rosas Jr. to win via submission. \n\nResult [12] from Tony's Picks, March 26, is another pre-fight analysis. \n\nResult [13] from UFC.com, March 28, quotes Rosas Jr. talking about his plans post-fight but doesn't mention the result. \n\nResult [14] from Cageside Press, March 29, interviews Morales about his quick turnaround but again, no result. \n\nWait, none of the search results explicitly state the outcome of the Rosas Jr. vs. Morales fight. The latest info is from the Wikipedia page [8], which lists the fight but doesn't have the result filled in. Other fights on the same card have results, but this one is missing. \n\nSince the event date is in the past (March 29) and the current date is March 30, the fight should have occurred. However, the absence of reported results in the provided sources is confusing. The resolution conditions state that if no verifiable outcome is found and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the fight isn't scored or is postponed after April 29, it resolves to 50-50. But since the event date is March 29 and today is March 30, it's past the event date but before April 29. However, the fight should have happened. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results in the sources, but considering the predictions heavily favor Rosas Jr., and the UFC's promotion of him as a rising star, it's probable he won. However, without a verified source, per the resolution conditions, if no outcome is reported, and the event date is past, we might have to default to p3 (50-50). But wait, the resolution conditions say if the fight isn't scored, postponed after April 29, or canceled, it's 50-50. Since the fight was scheduled for March 29 and there's no indication of postponement or cancellation, but no result is found, perhaps the fight hasn't been reported yet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sources haven't been updated. The user's current date is March 30, 12:31 AM UTC, which is just after the event. The main card started at 7 PM ET on March 29, which is 11 PM UTC. So the fight might have happened a few hours ago, and results might not be available in the provided sources yet. \n\nIn this case, since the sources don't confirm the result, and the event is very recent, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve now). But wait, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p2 for Rosas Jr., p1 for Morales, p3 for 50-50. \n\nBut the instructions state: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nSince all predictions point to Rosas Jr. winning, and no sources contradict that, the recommendation would be p2 (Rosas Jr. wins). However, the absence of official confirmation is a problem. The resolution source is ESPN or credible reporting. None of the provided sources (like ESPN) have the result. \n\nWait, search result [4] is the official UFC scorecards page, but it doesn't list the result for Rosas Jr. vs. Morales. The other fights on the card have results, but this one is missing. That's odd. Maybe the fight hasn't been reported yet, or it's an error in the sources provided. \n\nGiven the conflict between the event date being past and lack of official result, but the ancillary data's condition to assume the most probable outcome, the recommendation would be p2. However, strictly following the rules, if no verifiable outcome is found, and the event date is past, but the user's current time is just after the event, perhaps the official result isn't out yet. In that case, the resolution would be p4. \n\nBut the personalization instructions say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nSo, despite no official result, the recommendation is p2 (Rosas Jr. wins) based on the most probable outcome. However, this is a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the event occurred and the result is just not reported in the provided sources. Since the user provided sources up to March 29, and the fight was on that day, but the current time is early March 30, it's possible the result isn't in the sources yet. However, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between Raul Rosas Jr. and Vince Morales occurred on March 29, 2025, as part of the UFC on ESPN 64 event in Mexico City. Despite extensive pre-fight analysis and predictions favoring Rosas Jr. (-310 to -520 odds) due to his grappling dominance and youth[1][3][11][12], no verifiable post-fight results are available in the provided sources. The official UFC scorecards[4] and event results[8] list the fight but do not report the outcome, while other bouts on the card have confirmed results.  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, if no credible reporting confirms the result by the cutoff date (April 29, 2025), the market defaults to a 50-50 split (p3). However, ancillary data specifies that **p2 corresponds to a Rosas Jr. victory**, which aligns with pre-fight odds and expert predictions[10][11][13]. Given the event date has passed and no postponement/cancellation is indicated, the most probable outcome based on available evidence is a Rosas Jr. win.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
