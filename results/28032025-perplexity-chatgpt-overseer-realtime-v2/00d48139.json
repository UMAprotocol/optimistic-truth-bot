        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if there have been 500 or more confirmed measles cases in the U.S. in 2025 by March 28, 2025, based on the CDC's data. The ancillary data specifies that only the CDC's case counter is to be used, and other sources like state reports don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the latest CDC data. Looking at the sources, result [2] is from the CDC's page, last updated on March 21, 2025, reporting 378 cases. However, result [14] and [15] from March 28 mention 483 cases according to the CDC. Wait, but the user's note says only the CDC counter matters. Let me confirm.\n\nResult [14] (Xinhua) and [15] (The Star) both cite the CDC's data released on March 28, stating 483 cases. Additionally, result [16] (CIDRAP) and [17] (Becker's Hospital Review) also mention 483 cases as per the CDC. The key here is that the CDC's own update on March 28 is the critical source. \n\nThe CDC's page (result [2]) was last updated on March 21 with 378 cases, but the March 28 update from other sources references the CDC's latest numbers. Since the resolution time is March 28, 11:59 PM ET, the March 28 CDC data is what's needed. Even though the direct CDC link in result [2] hasn't been updated beyond March 21 in the provided search results, the later sources [14], [15], [16], and [17] all confirm that the CDC reported 483 cases by March 28. \n\nTherefore, the CDC's count as of March 28 is 483, which exceeds 500? Wait, no, 483 is under 500. Wait, the user's query is 500 or more. But 483 is less than 500. Wait, but result [16] says \"approach 500\" and result [17] says 483. So according to the CDC's data on March 28, it's 483 cases. That's below 500. But wait, result [16] also mentions Texas alone has 400 cases. However, the ancillary data specifies that only the CDC's total count matters, not state reports. So even if Texas reports 400, the CDC's total is 483, which is under 500. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). But wait, result [14] and [15] say 483, which is under 500. So the answer is No. But wait, the user's query says \"500 or more\", so 483 is below, so resolve to No. But wait, result [8] mentions 483 cases as of this week, and the CDC leadership didn't want to publish it. But the ancillary data says to use the CDC's counter. If the CDC's official count is 483 as of March 28, then it's under 500. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But I need to make sure the CDC's count is indeed 483. The latest CDC data in the search results is from March 21 (378), but the March 28 sources cite the CDC's update. Since the resolution source is the CDC's counter, even if other sources report higher, the CDC's official number is 483, which is under 500. Therefore, the answer is No.\n</think>\n\nThe CDC's official measles case count for 2025 reached 483 confirmed cases as of March 28, 2025, according to their latest data release[14][15][17]. This falls short of the 500-case threshold specified in the resolution conditions. While Texas alone reported 400 cases in its regional outbreak[16], the ancillary data explicitly states that only CDC-reported national totals qualify for resolution, overriding state-level figures.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths and weaknesses that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the CDC's measles case count as the sole source for resolution, adhering to the user prompt's instructions. It also correctly notes that only the national total reported by the CDC counts, not state-level reports. However, the response contains a significant amount of redundant and confusing \"wait\" statements that could confuse the reader or decision-maker. This redundancy does not contribute to clarity or accuracy.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by connecting the CDC's reported data with the resolution conditions. However, the reasoning process is cluttered with repetitive and unnecessary reevaluation (\"But wait\" statements), which could be streamlined for clarity and effectiveness. The response eventually concludes correctly based on the data provided, but the path to this conclusion is overly convoluted.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event (CDC measles case count) and aligns the recommendation with the facts presented. The final recommendation of \"No\" (p1) is based on the CDC's reported figure of 483 cases, which is below the 500-case threshold required for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the factual content, but the response's presentation is error-prone due to its repetitive questioning of its conclusions. This could be seen as a lack of confidence in the data presented, which is not ideal for a decision-making tool.\n\n**Decision**:\nGiven the correct final conclusion but poor presentation and reasoning clarity, a retry could potentially refine the response to be more concise and authoritative. The factual basis is sound, but the delivery could be significantly improved for clarity and decisiveness.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response correctly identifies and uses the CDC data as per the user prompt but is marred by repetitive and confusing reasoning.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if there have been 500 or more confirmed measles cases in the U.S. in 2025 according to the CDC by March 28, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends solely on the CDC's reported numbers, not state agencies or other sources. \n\nFirst, I need to check the CDC data. The search results include multiple sources. Let's look at the CDC's own page in result [4]. The latest update there is March 20, 2025, reporting 378 cases. But there's a note that starting February 21, they update every Friday. March 20 is a Thursday, so the next update would be March 21. However, result [9] mentions that on March 11, the CDC had 378 cases, and result [10] and [12] from Xinhua on March 28 cite the CDC's Friday update, stating 483 cases. Wait, March 28 is a Friday, so that's the latest CDC update before the deadline.\n\nBut result [4] shows the CDC's page as of March 20 with 378 cases. However, result [9] mentions that the CDC reversed their decision to update monthly and started updating weekly on February 20. The Xinhua articles [10] and [12] from March 28 reference the CDC's data released that day, which is the latest before the deadline. They report 483 cases. Additionally, result [14] from CIDRAP on March 28 also mentions 400 cases in Texas alone, but the CDC's total is 483. \n\nThe key point is that the user's note specifies only CDC-reported cases count. Even though Texas reports 400, the CDC's number is 483 as of March 28. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). However, I need to confirm that the 483 figure is from the CDC. The Xinhua articles [10] and [12] both cite the CDC's data released on March 28, which is within the deadline. Therefore, the CDC's count exceeds 500 by March 28? Wait, no, 483 is under 500. Wait, the query is 500 or more. Wait, the user's query says \"500+ Measles cases in U.S. before April?\" with the deadline March 28. The CDC's data as of March 28 is 483, which is below 500. But wait, result [8] from ProPublica on March 28 mentions 483 cases, and result [14] also says approaching 500. However, the CDC's own data in [10] and [12] is 483. So the answer would be \"No\" because 483 is less than 500. But wait, the user's query says \"by March 28, 2025, 11:59 PM ET\". The latest CDC update is March 28, reporting 483. Therefore, the answer is \"No\" (p1). But wait, result [15] from Becker's Hospital Review on March 28 says the CDC confirmed 483 cases, which is under 500. So the correct resolution is \"No\". Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe CDC's official measles case count as of March 28, 2025, stands at **483 confirmed cases** according to their weekly update released on that date[10][12][15]. This falls short of the 500-case threshold required for a \"Yes\" resolution. While Texas state health authorities reported 400 cases in their regional outbreak[3][12][14], the market explicitly specifies that **only CDC-reported figures qualify** for resolution, overriding higher state-level counts.\n\nKey details from CDC data:\n- **483 cases** confirmed nationwide as of March 28[10][12]\n- 93% of cases linked to 5 outbreaks[12]\n- 97% occurred in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status[12]\n- Hospitalization rate of 14%[15]\n- Two measles-related deaths confirmed[10][14]\n\nThough case numbers nearly doubled 2024's total of 285 in just three months[10][15], the CDC's final pre-deadline count remains below 500. This outcome highlights the importance of the resolution source specification, as conflicting state and federal reporting numbers created potential ambiguity.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt by focusing solely on the CDC-reported measles cases, as specified. The response correctly identifies that only CDC-reported figures qualify for resolution, disregarding state-level reports which do not meet the criteria set by the user prompt. The final count of 483 cases reported by the CDC is correctly used to determine the outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a logical and well-structured analysis of the available data. It correctly interprets the requirement of having 500 or more cases for a \"Yes\" resolution and concludes appropriately that the count of 483 does not meet this threshold. The response also effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the CDC's reported figure, enhancing the reliability of the conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event (number of measles cases reported by the CDC) against the specified resolution source and date. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts presented, as the CDC's count of 483 cases is below the required 500 cases, leading to a \"No\" resolution (p1).\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The response does not miss any critical information necessary for resolution. It effectively uses the specified source (CDC) and corroborates this information with additional reliable sources to ensure accuracy.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the user prompt instructions. The recommendation of \"No\" (p1) is fully justified by the analysis, and there is no ambiguity or error that would necessitate a retry or default to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, provides a logical and complete analysis, verifies the event correctly, and aligns the recommendation with the established facts without any errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the CDC's reported figure, enhancing the reliability of the conclusion.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.
