The ancillary data specifies that if the Ducks win, it's p1; Rangers win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 28, 2025. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the event has already occurred. Now, I need to determine who won.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] is a recap from the Ducks' official site titled \"Recap: McTavish's OT Goal Clinches Dramatic Comeback Win Over Rangers\" dated March 29, 2025. It states the Ducks won 5-4 in overtime. Source [9] from NHL.com also mentions McTavish scoring in OT for a 5-4 Ducks victory. ESPN's box score [7] and recap [10] both list the final score as Ducks 5-4 Rangers in OT. Additionally, YouTube highlights [4][5] describe the Ducks' comeback and OT win.\n\nAll credible sources agree the Ducks won. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Ducks). The answer must cite the relevant sources and end with the recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks defeated the New York Rangers 5-4 in overtime on March 28, 2025, completing a dramatic comeback after trailing by two goals late in the third period. Mason McTavish scored the game-winning goal 59 seconds into overtime, assisted by Jackson LaCombe[1][9]. Leo Carlsson led the Ducks' offense with a goal and three assists, while Cutter Gauthier and Olen Zellweger scored critical third-period goals to force overtime[1][4][9].\n\n**Key details:**\n- **Regulation timeline**: The Rangers held leads of 2-1, 3-1, and 4-2 before Anaheim's late rally[1][9].\n- **Overtime winner**: McTavish converted a backdoor pass from LaCombe for his seventh point in six games[1][9].\n- **Standings impact**: The Ducks improved to 32-32-8 (72 points), while the Rangers fell to 34-32-7 (75 points)[1][7][9].\n\nThe outcome meets the resolution criteria specified in the ancillary data, with no evidence of postponement or cancellation. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response is well-supported by multiple credible sources, including the Ducks' official site, NHL.com, ESPN, and YouTube highlights, which all confirm the game's outcome.\n\nThe response adheres to the system prompt instructions by focusing solely on verified facts about the event that has already occurred. It does not speculate or predict but rather reports on the definitive outcome of the game. The response also correctly identifies that the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp and that there is no evidence of postponement or cancellation, which would have affected the resolution.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks the event date, confirms the game has occurred, and verifies the outcome through multiple sources. The response is complete in detailing the game's critical moments and the final result, ensuring that the resolution recommendation is based on concrete evidence.\n\nThere are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt and ancillary data, ensuring that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
