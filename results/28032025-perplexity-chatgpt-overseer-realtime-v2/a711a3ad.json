The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the MLB game between the Los Angeles Angels and Chicago White Sox on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is White Sox, p2 is Angels, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game was played on March 29 and determine the official result. Let's look through the search results provided. \n\nSearch result [3] is a condensed game video from March 29, 2025, between the Angels and White Sox. The title mentions Jos\u00e9 Soriano and Jonathan Cannon as the starting pitchers, which matches the teams and date. \n\nLooking at result [7], it states that Jos\u00e9 Soriano pitched seven scoreless innings leading the Angels to a 1-0 victory over the White Sox on March 29. This directly indicates the Angels won that game. \n\nResult [8] is a YouTube video recap titled \"Chicago White Sox 1-0 loss to LA Angels,\" which corroborates the Angels' 1-0 win. \n\nAdditionally, result [5] mentions the game on March 29, though the content is mostly video elements. However, the title and context align with the other sources confirming the game occurred. \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or suspended, as all sources report it as completed. The official MLB outcome, as per the resolution conditions, would thus be an Angels win. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels defeated the Chicago White Sox 1-0 in the MLB game played on March 29, 2025. Jos\u00e9 Soriano delivered a dominant performance with seven scoreless innings, allowing only two hits and two walks[7]. The Angels scored the game's only run in the eighth inning when Yo\u00e1n Moncada drove in Jorge Soler with an infield single[7]. White Sox starter Jonathan Cannon pitched five scoreless innings but received no run support[8]. The game was completed without suspension or postponement, and Major League Baseball officially recorded the Angels as the victors[7][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (MLB game between LAA Angels and CWS White Sox on March 29, 2025) and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The response uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the game, ensuring that the information is reliable and consistent across different references.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event occurred as scheduled and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly concludes that the game was not postponed, suspended, or ended in a tie, and it adheres to the MLB's official result.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, including a condensed game video and a YouTube video recap, which both confirm the Angels' victory. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 (Angels win) aligns perfectly with the verified facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response thoroughly checks for different conditions (postponement, suspension, official result) and uses appropriate sources to confirm the factual outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the ancillary data provided, and the resolution conditions are strictly followed.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on verified facts and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and logically processes the information to provide a clear and accurate resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412492 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:14:52 UTC"
