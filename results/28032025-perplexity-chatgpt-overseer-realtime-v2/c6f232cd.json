The ancillary data specifies that if Michigan State wins, it's p1; Ole Miss wins, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date is March 29, 2025, which is after the game's scheduled date of March 28. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to determine the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources report the game result. Source [2] from ABC News states that Michigan State won 73-70. Source [3] from Ole Miss's official site confirms the loss, mentioning the final score as 73-70. Similarly, sources [4], [5], and [6] all corroborate Michigan State's victory. The YouTube video in [8] also highlights Michigan State's win. \n\nAll the credible sources agree that Michigan State emerged victorious. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1, which corresponds to Michigan State winning.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 game between Ole Miss and Michigan State took place on March 28, 2025, as scheduled. Michigan State defeated Ole Miss with a final score of **73-70**[2][3][4]. The Spartans overcame a nine-point second-half deficit, with Jase Richardson leading the team with 24 points[2][4]. Ole Miss, led by Sean Pedulla's 24 points, held leads in both halves but couldn't maintain the advantage[3][5].  \n\nKey moments included:  \n- Michigan State taking its first lead at 65-63 with 57 seconds remaining[2][6].  \n- Carson Cooper's late layup extending the lead to 67-63[2].  \n- Ole Miss cutting the deficit to two points in the final seconds before Michigan State secured the win[3][5].  \n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **Michigan State** (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
