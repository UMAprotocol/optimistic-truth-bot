The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Ole Miss vs. Michigan State game scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:09 PM ET. The current date is March 29, 2025, so the game should have already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any information about the game's outcome. Let's go through each source. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are predictions and previews written before the game. For example, sources [1] through [11] all discuss predictions, odds, and team stats leading up to the game. They mention the date as March 28, 2025, but none of them report the actual result since they were published before the game. \n\nSource [12] is a live score page from ESPN Africa. The URL suggests it's a game page for the March 28 matchup. However, the content shown here doesn't include the final score. The page might have been updated after the game, but the snippet provided doesn't show the result. \n\nSince the current date is March 29, the game should have taken place. But none of the provided sources explicitly state the outcome. The lack of post-game reports in the search results indicates that the available information is from before the game. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if the event date is in the past and there's no verifiable information, we assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Michigan State winning and p2 as Ole Miss. The predictions in the sources mostly favor Michigan State, with models giving them a 64% chance (source [7]) and ESPN analysts picking Michigan State (source [8]). \n\nSince there's no evidence of the game being postponed or canceled, and the date has passed, the resolution should default to the most probable outcome, which is Michigan State winning. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 game between Ole Miss and Michigan State occurred on March 28, 2025, at 7:09 PM ET as scheduled. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Michigan State\" (p1)** since no verifiable outcome reports exist in the provided sources, and probabilistic models/analyst predictions overwhelmingly favored Michigan State (64% win probability per Dimers.com simulations [7], with ESPN analysts unanimously selecting MSU [8]). The game wasn't postponed or canceled based on available evidence.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the Ole Miss vs. Michigan State basketball game scheduled for March 28, 2025, has several critical issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game was scheduled for March 28, 2025, and that the current date is March 29, 2025, indicating the game should have occurred. However, the response fails to provide a verifiable outcome of the game based on concrete evidence, which is a key requirement. Instead, it relies on probabilistic models and pre-game analyst predictions to determine the outcome, which is not in line with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts of events that have already occurred.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response's reasoning is flawed because it defaults to the most probable outcome based on predictions rather than actual results. The system prompt explicitly states that the AI should report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. The response does not adhere to this instruction, as it does not confirm the actual occurrence and result of the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not verify the actual occurrence of the event as required. It assumes the game was not postponed or canceled without providing evidence to support this assumption. The recommendation to resolve the market as a Michigan State win (p1) is based on predictions rather than the actual game result, which does not align with the facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response exhibits a bias towards predictive information rather than factual post-event data. It also errs by not seeking or finding post-game results, which are crucial for resolving the market accurately.\n\nGiven these issues, the response from Perplexity AI is not satisfactory and needs improvement. The reliance on predictions rather than actual results is a significant deviation from the instructions provided in the system prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response relies on probabilistic models and predictions rather than verified post-event outcomes, which is contrary to the instructions requiring resolution based on concrete evidence of events that have already occurred.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response fails to verify the actual occurrence and result of the game, relying instead on pre-game predictions. It does not adhere to the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts of events that have already occurred.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please ensure the response is based on verified post-event information.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Ole Miss vs. Michigan State basketball game that was scheduled for March 28, 2025, at 7:09 PM ET. The current date is March 29, 2025, so the game should have already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any information about the game's outcome. The search results provided include sources up to March 29, 2025, at 9:17 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. \n\nLooking at the sources, [3] from sportingnews.com mentions that as of 9:17 PM (UTC), Michigan State was leading 67-65 with 33 seconds left. However, this is a live update and doesn't confirm the final result. Other sources like [6] from cbssports.com also provide live updates but don't give a final score. \n\nMost of the other search results ([1], [2], [4], [5], [7]-[15]) are previews, predictions, or odds discussions before the game. They don't contain the actual outcome. The key here is that none of the provided sources explicitly state the final result of the game. The only live update is from [3], which is a snapshot during the game but doesn't conclude it. \n\nSince the event date is in the past and there's no verifiable information on the outcome in the provided sources, according to the user's instructions, if no outcome is available, and the event date is past, we should default to p4. However, the ancillary data specifies that if the game is canceled, it resolves to 50-50 (p3), but there's no mention of cancellation. The user's personalization rules state that if the event date is in the past but no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. However, the instructions also say that if no verifiable info is available, default to p4. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization also mentions that if the event is in the past and no info is available, but the user prompt's ancillary data defines resolution based on the most probable outcome. However, the search results don't provide the actual result, so we can't confirm. The live update from [3] is inconclusive. Therefore, since there's no confirmed outcome in the sources, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data here defines p1 as Michigan State, p2 as Ole Miss. The most probable outcome based on predictions in the sources (e.g., [7], [8], [9], [10], [15]) heavily favor Michigan State. However, the instructions say to use verified facts, not predictions. Since there's no verified outcome, despite predictions, we should default to p4. \n\nBut the user's additional guidance says: \"If no information on the game's outcome is available, the response should default to p4.\" Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 game between Ole Miss and Michigan State occurred on March 28, 2025, at 7:09 PM ET. While multiple sources provided pre-game analysis and live updates during the matchup, **no verifiable post-game results confirming the final outcome appear in the provided search results**. Key details include:\n\n- **Live game tracking** showed Michigan State leading 67-65 with 33 seconds remaining in the second half[3], but no conclusive final score was documented in the available sources.  \n- **Predictive models** heavily favored Michigan State (64% win probability)[9], with projected scores like 75-71[9] and 75-64[10] circulating pre-game.  \n- **Betting markets** positioned Michigan State as a 3.5-point favorite[7][12], reflecting broader expectations of a Spartan victory.  \n\nGiven the absence of verified post-game reporting about the result, cancellation, or postponement, this market **cannot be definitively resolved** based on the evidence provided.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game between Ole Miss and Michigan State was scheduled and provides a live update during the game. However, it fails to provide a final outcome, which is crucial for resolving the market. The response adheres to the instruction of not predicting outcomes and focusing on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the lack of a final score and adheres to the guidelines by recommending p4 due to the absence of verified post-game results. This reasoning is sound given the instructions to rely on concrete evidence for event outcomes.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred but does not verify the final outcome. It aligns with the ancillary data and user prompt instructions by defaulting to p4 when no conclusive evidence is available about the game's result.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias but lacks complete information regarding the final outcome of the game. It correctly identifies that no sources provide the final score, which is a critical piece of information for resolving the market.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still defaults to p4 due to the absence of conclusive evidence about the game's outcome, and considering the critical rule that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always be retried, the following decision is made:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately follows the instructions by defaulting to p4 due to the lack of verified post-game results, adhering to the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts. The logical reasoning is sound, and there is no available information missed according to the sources checked.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough in checking for the final outcome and adheres strictly to the guidelines of using verified facts. However, it would benefit from a more extensive search or waiting for more conclusive post-game information if possible in future scenarios.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThis decision reflects the response's adherence to the guidelines and the logical processing of available information, despite the inherent limitations of the current data regarding the event's outcome.",
