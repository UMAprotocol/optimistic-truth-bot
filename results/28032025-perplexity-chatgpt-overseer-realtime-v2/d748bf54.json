        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Detroit Tigers vs. Los Angeles Dodgers game on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Dodgers, p2 is Tigers, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results all mention the game took place on March 29, 2025. Sources like ESPN [1], MLB.com [2], and the AP recap [11] confirm the game happened. No mentions of postponement or cancellation, so the 50-50 condition doesn't apply here.\n\nNext, determine the official outcome. Multiple sources report the Dodgers won 7-3. For example, ESPN's recap [1] states the final score, and the AP article [11] reiterates the Dodgers' victory. The YouTube highlights [7] and MLB.com video [8] also back this up. The Tigers' record drops to 0-3, while the Dodgers start 5-0 [3][12].\n\nI should check if the game was completed. The detailed inning breakdown in [1] shows the game went through all nine innings. No indications of suspension or early termination. The AP recap [11] mentions the game ended with a final score, so it was official.\n\nSince the game was played to completion and the Dodgers won, according to the resolution conditions, p1 (Dodgers) is the correct resolution. All sources align on the outcome without contradictions. No need to consider future dates since the event has passed. The answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Detroit Tigers 7-3 in their March 29, 2025 MLB game at Dodger Stadium[1][11][12]. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, and was completed in full with no suspensions or ties[1][7][11].  \n\nKey details:  \n- The Dodgers took control with a two-run double by Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez in the fifth inning[6][11] and home runs from Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Tommy Edman[1][7][11].  \n- Detroit's Reese Olson (0-1) took the loss, while Dodgers reliever Anthony Banda earned the win[1][11].  \n- The outcome was officially recorded by MLB, with Los Angeles improving to 5-0 and Detroit falling to 0-3[3][12].  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, this market resolves to **p1** (Dodgers win).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
