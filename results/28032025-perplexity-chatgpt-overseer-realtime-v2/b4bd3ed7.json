        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said the word \"Astronaut\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of the interview and whether the term \"Astronaut\" was used. The search results include several sources related to the interview. \n\nLooking at result [10], there's a mention of Musk calling Senator Mark Kelly a \"traitor.\" Kelly is a former astronaut, but the question is whether Musk used the word \"astronaut\" itself. In the transcript excerpt, Musk refers to Kelly as a \"decorated veteran, a former astronaut, a sitting U.S. senator.\" Wait, that's Bret Baier speaking, not Musk. The user's query is about Musk saying the word, not Baier.\n\nResult [9] includes a part of the interview where Musk discusses Ukraine and refers to Mark Kelly. Again, Baier mentions Kelly's astronaut background, but Musk's response doesn't include the word \"astronaut.\" He calls Kelly a traitor but doesn't use the term \"astronaut.\"\n\nResult [15] has a transcript snippet where Musk talks about rescuing astronauts. He says, \"SpaceX could have brought the astronauts back.\" Here, Musk uses the word \"astronauts\" plural. The market allows for pluralization, so this counts. \n\nAnother source, result [7], in the transcript, Musk says, \"can you rescue the astronauts uh yes we're bringing them back in a few weeks.\" Again, \"astronauts\" is used. \n\nResult [3] mentions Musk's interview with Trump where they discuss astronauts, but that's a different interview. The focus is on the March 27 interview with Baier.\n\nResult [13] discusses Musk's claims about stranded astronauts, but the key point is the Baier interview. The transcript in [15] and [7] are from the specific interview in question. \n\nSince the term \"astronauts\" was used by Musk during the interview, even in plural form, the market should resolve to \"Yes.\" The ancillary data states that pluralization counts, so this meets the condition.\n</think>\n\nElon Musk used the term \"astronauts\" during his March 27, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News' *Special Report*. In the interview, Musk explicitly stated:  \n**\"SpaceX could have brought the astronauts back\"** [15] and **\"we're bringing them back in a few weeks\"** [7], directly using the plural form of the specified term.  \n\nThe resolution conditions allow for pluralization/possessive forms of \"astronaut\" to count, and the interview was released in full by the March 28 deadline[14]. No evidence suggests the interview was canceled or partially unreleased.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that Elon Musk used the term \"astronauts\" during the interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. It correctly notes that pluralization of the term \"astronaut\" counts towards the resolution of the market, as specified in the user prompt. The response also correctly disregards mentions of the term by Bret Baier, focusing solely on Musk's usage, which aligns with the prompt's requirement.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks multiple sources and excerpts from the interview to confirm whether the term \"astronaut\" was used by Elon Musk. It provides specific instances from the interview where Musk used the term in its plural form, which is acceptable according to the market's rules. The response does not show any logical fallacies or gaps in reasoning.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the interview took place as scheduled and was not canceled. It confirms that the interview was released in full by the specified deadline. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) is based on verified instances of Musk using the term \"astronauts\" during the interview, which aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the relevant interview and correctly applies the rules specified in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) is justified based on the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the use of the term 'astronauts' by Elon Musk in the interview, adheres to the resolution conditions, and provides a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the usage of the term, adheres to the specific conditions of the user prompt, and provides a clear and accurate recommendation based on the established facts.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743408934 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:15:34 UTC",
