        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Elon Musk said the word \"Education\" during his interview with Bret Baier on March 27, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for mentions of that interview. The key sources here are [2], [3], [4], [7], [10], [13], and [14]. \n\nLooking at source [3], there's a transcript snippet where Musk talks about budgetary savings and mentions \"social security\" and \"IRS\", but not \"Education\". Source [4] quotes Musk discussing reducing spending by 15%, but again, no mention of \"Education\". \n\nSource [7] from Politico details the interview topics, including government efficiency and Social Security, but doesn't note \"Education\". Source [13] includes a transcript where Musk answers various questions, including about conflicts of interest and future plans, but \"Education\" isn't mentioned there either. \n\nSource [14] discusses Musk's concerns about birth rates and America's future, but again, no mention of the specific term. The other sources, like [2] and [10], provide context about the interview but don't include the actual content where \"Education\" would be used.\n\nNotably, in the earlier interviews from February (sources [1], [5], [6], [9], [11]), Trump mentions directing Musk to the Department of Education, but that's a different event. The March 27 interview with Bret Baier is the focus here, and none of the provided transcripts or summaries from that date include Musk saying \"Education\". \n\nSince the resolution depends on the March 27 interview and the search results don't show Musk using the term there, the answer should be \"No\". The ancillary data specifies that any usage counts, but pluralization or possessive forms are considered. However, the transcripts don't indicate any such usage. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nElon Musk did not say the word \"Education\" during his March 27, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News' *Special Report*. Multiple transcripts and summaries of the interview ([3][4][7][13][14]) show Musk discussed DOGE's cost-cutting goals (aiming for $1 trillion deficit reduction), modernization efforts for outdated systems like Social Security, and transparency claims. While the term \"Department of Education\" appeared in earlier February interviews with Trump ([1][5][6][9][11]), it was absent from the March 27 event's verified content.\n\nThe interview focused on:\n- **Budgetary savings**: Musk stated DOGE aims to reduce federal spending by 15% through fraud/waste elimination[4][7]\n- **Modernization challenges**: Discussions about digitizing retirement systems and IRS software upgrades[3][7]\n- **Transparency claims**: Musk asserted DOGE publishes all actions online[13]\n- **Social Security reforms**: Defending system crashes as temporary side effects of anti-fraud measures[7]\n\nNo instances of \"Education\" (including plural/possessive forms) appear in available transcripts or reporting about this specific interview. The resolution conditions specify the March 27 interview as the sole focus, excluding prior events where Trump mentioned directing Musk to audit the Education Department.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be thorough and well-aligned with the requirements of the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions by focusing solely on whether Elon Musk mentioned the word \"Education\" during the specified interview on March 27, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on this specific event and uses multiple sources to verify that the term was not mentioned.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with a clear statement of the task, followed by a detailed examination of relevant sources, and concluding with a definitive resolution based on the evidence gathered. The AI checks multiple sources for mentions of the term \"Education\" and confirms its absence in the context of the specified interview.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event (the interview) and aligns the recommendation with the facts found in the sources. It correctly concludes that since the term \"Education\" was not mentioned in any of the verified sources, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI uses the specified sources and adheres strictly to the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) is supported by the evidence provided and is in line with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, logically analyzes the available sources, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-structured, effectively using multiple sources to confirm the absence of the term 'Education' in the specified interview, leading to a correct resolution recommendation.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410079 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:34:39 UTC",
