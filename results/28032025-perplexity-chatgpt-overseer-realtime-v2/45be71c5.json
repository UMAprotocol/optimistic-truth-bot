The ancillary data specifies that if the Flyers win, it's p1; Sabres win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 29, 2025. Multiple sources like [1], [3], [7], [15], [16], [17], [18], and [19] report the Flyers won 7-4. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the event is in the past. \n\nNext, confirm the result. All relevant sources state the Flyers won. For example, [1] says \"Flyers won their second straight with a 7-4 decision,\" and [3] mentions \"Matvei Michkov has 2nd straight 2-goal outing to lead the Flyers past the Sabres 7-4.\" There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nSince the game was played and the Flyers won, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information found. All sources agree on the outcome, so no need to consider p3. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers defeated the Buffalo Sabres 7-4 in their NHL game on March 29, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][3][7][15][16][17][18][19]. The game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Matvei Michkov led the Flyers with two goals, extending his rookie scoring streak, while Samuel Ersson made 17 saves. The Flyers secured their second consecutive win under interim coach Brad Shaw, outscoring opponents 13-8 in two games following John Tortorella's dismissal[1][3][13].  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- Final score: Flyers 7, Sabres 4[3][15][19]  \n- Game date: March 29, 2025 (completed)[1][3][15]  \n- No evidence of postponement or cancellation[1][3][7][15].  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Flyers\"** (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743410614 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:43:34 UTC"
