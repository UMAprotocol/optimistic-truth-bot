The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Jamall Emmers vs. Gabriel Miranda fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Emmers wins, it's p2; if Miranda wins, p1; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 29, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the fight has already happened. The next step is to verify the result using the provided sources. The user mentioned ESPN as the primary source, but other credible reports can be used. \n\nLooking through the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] from ESPN states Emmers won by TKO in the first round. Source [2] from SI.com also mentions Emmers' knockout victory. Source [3] from Cageside Press provides the official result as a TKO win for Emmers at 4:06 of Round 1. Source [5] from MMA Junkie USA Today and source [8] from Sherdog both describe Emmers' victory with a TKO. Additionally, source [9] from 411mania and source [10] from Bloody Elbow also confirm Emmers as the winner, despite a brief announcement error by Bruce Buffer. \n\nAll these sources are credible and consistent, so there's no ambiguity. The fight wasn't postponed or canceled, and the result is clear. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2, corresponding to Emmers' win.\n</think>\n\nJamall Emmers defeated Gabriel Miranda via TKO (punches) at 4:06 of the first round in their featherweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025[1][2][3][5][8][9]. Multiple credible sources including ESPN, MMA Junkie, Sherdog, and Cageside Press confirm the official result with Emmers landing a decisive combination of strikes that forced the referee stoppage[1][3][5][8]. Though announcer Bruce Buffer initially misidentified the winner during the post-fight announcement, this error was quickly corrected and doesn't affect the official outcome[10]. The fight concluded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, meeting all resolution criteria outlined in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here's a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Jamall Emmers vs. Gabriel Miranda at UFC Fight Night) and the date of the event. It verifies the outcome using multiple credible sources as specified in the user prompt, which include ESPN, SI.com, Cageside Press, MMA Junkie, Sherdog, 411mania, and Bloody Elbow. The response adheres to the instruction to use ESPN as the primary source but also correctly uses a consensus of credible reporting to confirm the outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event date and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It provides a detailed account of the fight's result, mentioning the specific manner of victory (TKO, punches) and the exact time in the round. This thorough verification ensures that the resolution is based on concrete evidence.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It aligns the recommendation (p2) with the ancillary data provided, where p2 corresponds to an Emmers win. The response also correctly handles a potential source of confusion (the announcer's error) by clarifying that it did not affect the official outcome.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. All information necessary for resolution is included, and the response remains objective, relying on multiple sources to confirm the outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
