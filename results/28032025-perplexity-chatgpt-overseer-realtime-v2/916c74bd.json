        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Emmers vs. Miranda fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Miranda, p2 is Emmers, and p3 is 50-50 if the fight is a draw, postponed past April 29, 2025, or canceled. The current date is March 29, 2025, 9:01 PM UTC, which is the same day as the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the fight has already happened. The search results include sources from March 28 and 29, 2025, which are just before and on the event date. Looking at the results, some articles are previews or predictions (like [1], [5], [6], [14], [15]), while others list fight cards ([2], [7], [9], [10], [16]). The key is to find any post-fight results. \n\nSearch result [10] from the same day (March 29, 2025) mentions the fight between Emmers and Miranda in the prelims but doesn't provide the result. The official result for another fight (Hubbard vs. Mederos) is listed, but not for Emmers vs. Miranda. Other sources like [2] also list the fight but don't have the result filled in. \n\nSince there's no explicit mention of the fight's outcome in the provided search results, and the current time is 9:01 PM UTC on March 29, which is after the event's start time (main card at 7 PM ET, which is 11 PM UTC), but the results from the event might not be fully reported yet. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. \n\nThe majority of predictions and analysis in the search results favor Emmers. Sources [1], [5], [6], [13], [14], [15] all predict Emmers to win, citing his striking, takedown defense, and Miranda's vulnerability to knockouts. Miranda's strength is submissions, but his chin is considered weak. Since there's no report of the actual result, and the event date is today, but the fight might have already occurred. However, without explicit confirmation, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) if the fight hasn't concluded yet. But the current time is 9:01 PM UTC, which is 4 PM ET. The main card starts at 7 PM ET, so the prelims, where this fight is listed, would be earlier. If the fight was scheduled for earlier in the day, but no results are found, it's possible the fight hasn't happened yet. However, the user's timestamp is 9:01 PM UTC, which is 5:01 PM ET. The event's prelims start at 4 PM ET, so the fight might be ongoing or yet to happen. \n\nWait, the event's main card is at 7 PM ET, prelims start at 4 PM ET. The current time is 9:01 PM UTC, which is 5:01 PM ET. So the prelims are ongoing. If the fight hasn't taken place yet, it's a future event, so resolve to p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. However, the ancillary data says if postponed after April 29, resolve to p3. But the event is today, so if the fight hasn't occurred yet, it's still pending. However, the user's current time is 9:01 PM UTC (March 29), which is 5:01 PM ET. The fight is part of the prelims starting at 4 PM ET. So the fight might have already happened. But without any results reported in the search results, and the latest info from [10] only shows results up to Hubbard vs. Mederos, which was a split decision. The Emmers vs. Miranda fight is listed after that, so perhaps it hasn't been reported yet. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results and the event still ongoing, the resolution would depend on whether the fight has concluded. Since the user's timestamp is after the event's start but before the main card, and the fight is on the prelims, it's possible the fight has already occurred but results aren't in the provided sources. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The majority of sources predict Emmers to win, so the recommendation would be p2 (Emmers). However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Since the current time is 5:01 PM ET and the prelims started at 4 PM ET, the fight might have already happened. But without confirmation, the safest is to check if the event is in the past. The event date is March 29, 2025, which is the same as the current date. Since the fight is part of the event happening today, and the current time is during the event, but the exact fight time isn't specified, it's unclear. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Since the fight is part of the event happening today, and the current time is during the event, but the fight's exact time isn't known, it's safer to consider it as future if the fight hasn't occurred yet. But without results, and the event ongoing, the resolution would be p4. Wait, the ancillary data says if the fight is postponed after April 29, resolve to p3. But the event is today, so if the fight hasn't happened yet, it's not postponed. The user's personalization says if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the current timestamp is March 29, 2025, 9:01 PM UTC, and the event is on the same day, but the fight's exact time isn't clear. If the fight is scheduled for later in the event, which is still ongoing, then it's a future event, hence p4. However, if the fight has already occurred but results aren't reported, then we have to go with the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the search results don't include any post-fight reports for Emmers vs. Miranda. All mentions are previews. Therefore, the fight hasn't been reported yet, implying it's either upcoming or the result isn't available. Since the event is ongoing, and the current time is during the event, the fight is considered future, hence p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. But the event date is today, which is the same as the current date. The fight is part of the event happening today. If the fight hasn't occurred yet, it's future. If it has occurred but no result is available, then it's unresolved. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event is today, and the current time is during the event, it's ambiguous. However, the user's timestamp is 9:01 PM UTC, which is 5:01 PM ET. The main card starts at 7 PM ET, so the prelims are from 4 PM to 7 PM ET. The fight between Emmers and Miranda is on the prelims, so it should have already happened by 5:01 PM ET. However, the search result [10] from the same day reports results up to Hubbard vs. Mederos, which was a split decision, and then lists Emmers vs. Miranda as the next fight. Since [10] is a live results page, and the Emmers vs. Miranda fight is listed after Hubbard vs. Mederos, which was resolved, it's possible that the Emmers fight hasn't happened yet at the time of the search results. Therefore, the fight is still future, leading to p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the Emmers vs. Miranda UFC fight is complex and detailed, but it ultimately concludes with a recommendation of p4, indicating that the event is considered future and cannot be resolved at this time. Here is a detailed evaluation of the response:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by analyzing the event's timing and the availability of results. It correctly identifies that the event is scheduled for the same day as the current timestamp and that no results are available yet. However, the response could be clearer in establishing whether the fight is indeed still upcoming or has just not been reported yet.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates thorough reasoning by considering various scenarios based on the event's schedule and the timing of the current timestamp. It explores the possibility of the fight having occurred or being about to occur. However, the response is somewhat repetitive and convoluted, which could confuse the reader. The reasoning could be streamlined for clarity and efficiency.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response attempts to verify the event using available information but finds no conclusive results about the fight's outcome. The decision to recommend p4 is aligned with the lack of available results and the ongoing status of the event at the time of the query.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. However, the response could benefit from a more decisive analysis of whether the fight is indeed upcoming or simply unreported. This distinction is crucial for determining whether p4 is the most appropriate recommendation.\n\nGiven the critical rule that a first attempt resulting in a p4 must always be retried, and considering the potential for a more streamlined and decisive analysis, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response, while detailed, could benefit from a more streamlined and decisive analysis to clarify whether the fight is upcoming or unreported. A retry could potentially yield a more definitive resolution based on updated or more precise information.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is overly complex and repetitive, which could lead to confusion. It needs to more decisively determine the fight's status relative to the current timestamp.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please provide a more concise analysis focusing on determining the exact status of the fight (completed but unreported vs. upcoming) relative to the current timestamp.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Jamall Emmers vs. Gabriel Miranda fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The current date is March 29, 2025, 9:03:36 PM UTC, which is the same day as the event. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if the fight has already happened. The search results mention the event's start time as 4:00 PM EST. Converting that to UTC, EST is UTC-5, so 4:00 PM EST would be 9:00 PM UTC. The current time is 9:03 PM UTC, which is just three minutes after the main card's scheduled start. However, the Emmers vs. Miranda fight is part of the prelims, which according to source [3] and [7] were set to kick off at 4:00 PM ET (same as the main card start time). But source [11] lists the event as taking place on March 30, which might be a typo or time zone confusion. \n\nLooking at the fight card structure, Emmers vs. Miranda is listed in the prelims. Since the main card starts at 4:00 PM EST, the prelims would have started earlier. However, the exact timing of their specific bout isn't provided, but given that the current time is just past the main card start, it's possible their fight hasn't occurred yet. \n\nSources [1], [5], and [9] all state the event is on March 29, 2025, and the main card starts at 4:00 PM EST. The current UTC time is 9:03 PM, which is 4:03 PM EST. Since the main card just started, the prelims might still be ongoing or the fight could be scheduled later in the card. However, without real-time updates or results from the fight, there's no confirmation of the outcome. \n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, the recommendation should be p4. Since the fight is part of an event that's currently ongoing but hasn't concluded, and there's no verifiable outcome reported yet, the resolution should default to p4. \n\nAdditionally, checking all sources, none report the fight's result yet. All sources are pre-fight analyses or previews. Therefore, the fight is either ongoing or hasn't started, making it a future event relative to the current time. Hence, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe Jamall Emmers vs. Gabriel Miranda featherweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg was scheduled for March 29, 2025, with the main card starting at 4:00 PM EST (9:00 PM UTC)[1][5][9]. The current timestamp is **9:03:36 PM UTC on March 29, 2025**, placing it just three minutes after the main card's scheduled start time.  \n\n### Key Analysis:  \n1. **Event Timing**:  \n   - The fight was part of the prelims, which typically occur before the main card[3][7]. However, no sources confirm whether the prelims concluded before the main card or if the Emmers-Miranda bout occurred.  \n   - The event\u2019s official start time (4:00 PM EST) aligns with the current UTC timestamp (9:03 PM UTC), suggesting the event is ongoing[1][5].  \n\n2. **Outcome Verification**:  \n   - All 13 search results are pre-fight analyses, odds, or previews. None report live results or confirm the fight\u2019s completion[1\u201313].  \n   - The most recent source ([11], dated March 19, 2025) lists the fight card but provides no results.  \n\n3. **Ancillary Data Alignment**:  \n   - The resolution conditions specify **p4** if the event is unresolved by April 29, 2025, or if no verifiable outcome exists.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nAs of **9:03:36 PM UTC on March 29, 2025**, the fight\u2019s status remains unverified. The event is either ongoing or unreported, and no credible sources confirm the outcome.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about the resolution of a UFC fight between Jamall Emmers and Gabriel Miranda that was scheduled for March 29, 2025. The current date provided is March 29, 2025, at 9:06 PM UTC, which is the same day as the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the fight has already taken place. The search results include sources from March 29, 2025, like [3] and [12], which mention the event happening today. However, looking at the detailed results, [3] provides live results from the event. In [3], under the section for Jamall Emmers vs. Gabriel Miranda, there's a placeholder for the official result but no actual outcome reported. Similarly, [12] lists the fight in the prelims but doesn't provide the result, only the betting odds and a preview.\n\nNext, I check other sources. Most of the search results, like [1], [2], [4], [6], [8], [9], [10], [11], and [13], are from dates leading up to March 29, 2025, and they all discuss the fight as upcoming. For example, [1] lists the full results for the event but only includes the fighters' names without outcomes, indicating the results are not yet available. [9] and [11] provide start times, confirming the event is on March 29 but don't give results. \n\nThe key point is the current time. The event's main card was scheduled to start at 7 PM ET, which is 11 PM UTC. Since the current time is 9:06 PM UTC (which is 5:06 PM ET), the event hasn't concluded yet. The preliminary fights, including Emmers vs. Miranda, would have started earlier, around 4 PM ET (8 PM UTC). However, without a confirmed result from the sources, especially the live results in [3] and [12] not listing the outcome, it's likely the fight either hasn't happened yet or the results haven't been reported in the available sources.\n\nGiven that the current timestamp is before the main card's start time and the sources don't confirm the fight's outcome, the event is still ongoing or the results are pending. Therefore, the fight hasn't been resolved yet, and according to the ancillary data, if the event is postponed after April 29, 2025, it would resolve to p3. However, since the fight is scheduled for today and hasn't been postponed, but the result isn't available, the appropriate resolution is p4 (unknown/50-50) as per the user's instructions when no verifiable outcome is found.\n</think>\n\nThe Jamall Emmers vs. Gabriel Miranda featherweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg was scheduled for March 29, 2025, with the event starting at 4 PM ET (8 PM UTC). The current timestamp provided is **9:06 PM UTC on March 29, 2025**, which corresponds to **5:06 PM ET**\u2014placing it **during the preliminary card** but before the main card\u2019s 7 PM ET start time.  \n\nAvailable sources ([3][12]) confirm the fight was part of the prelims but do not report a definitive outcome. Live results from the event ([3][12]) list the fight as part of the card but lack scoring or official results for this specific bout. All pre-event sources ([1][2][4][6][8][9][10][11][13]) discuss the matchup as upcoming, with no post-fight updates.  \n\nSince the fight was scheduled for today and no postponement or cancellation is indicated, but no verifiable outcome exists in the provided sources, the resolution defaults to **p4** (unknown/50-50) under the ancillary data\u2019s conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the date and time of the event relative to the current timestamp, confirming that the event is scheduled for the same day but has not yet concluded. This aligns well with the system prompt's instruction to verify the event's occurrence and context as specified in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically deduces that since the current time is before the main card's start time and no sources confirm the fight's outcome, the event is still ongoing or the results are pending. This reasoning is sound and follows the logical steps required by the system prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response checks multiple sources to verify the status of the fight, noting that none provide a definitive outcome. This thorough check aligns with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors. It appropriately uses the sources mentioned, focusing on the most relevant and recent information regarding the fight's status. However, the response could potentially improve by seeking additional real-time updates or immediate sources that might have become available at the last minute.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response has adhered to the instructions, provided a logical and complete analysis, and aligned the recommendation with the facts without any apparent errors or biases, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately assesses the event's status using the correct sources and logical reasoning, aligning the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions and system prompt requirements.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses available sources to determine the fight's status, adhering closely to the system prompt instructions. It provides a clear, logical analysis and justifies the recommendation of p4 based on the current information.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThis decision reflects confidence in the response's accuracy and reliability, considering all available information and the constraints of the current timestamp relative to the event's scheduled time.",

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743281966 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 20:59:26 UTC",
