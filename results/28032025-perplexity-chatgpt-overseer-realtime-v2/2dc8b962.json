        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Mavericks vs. Bulls game on March 29, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Bulls, p2 for Mavericks, and p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened and the outcome. The current date given is March 30, 2025, so the game should have already taken place. Let me look through the search results for any mention of the game's result.\n\nLooking at the sources, most of them are previews or predictions, not actual results. For example, source [1] is a prediction from March 28, 2025, talking about the upcoming game. Similarly, sources [2] to [12] all discuss predictions, betting odds, injuries, and previews, but none explicitly state the game's outcome. \n\nWait, source [9] from thescore.com lists the game as scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 12:00 AM, which might be a time zone difference. But the user's query says the game was scheduled for March 29 at 8:00 PM ET. There's a discrepancy here. However, the current timestamp is March 30, 2:25 AM UTC, which is March 29, 10:25 PM ET. If the game was at 8 PM ET on March 29, it should have concluded by now. But none of the sources report the actual result; they're all previews. \n\nSince all the provided search results are from before the game date and don't include the outcome, there's no verifiable information on who won. The ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions in the sources mostly favor the Bulls, with some models predicting a close win. For example, source [12] predicts Bulls 119-116, and [13] says Bulls 118-116. \n\nGiven that the Bulls were on a winning streak, had home advantage, and the Mavericks were struggling with injuries, the most probable outcome based on the sources is a Bulls win. However, without confirmed results, the resolution should follow the ancillary data's instruction to assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1 (Bulls). But wait, the resolution conditions in the ancillary data have p1 as Bulls and p2 as Mavericks. Since the predictions lean towards Bulls, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks and Chicago Bulls were scheduled to play on March 29, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. Based on the provided search results, all sources are previews or predictions published before the game date, with no post-game reports confirming the actual outcome[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. \n\nKey factors from pre-game analysis:\n- The Bulls had won 9 of their last 11 games, including a dramatic buzzer-beater victory against the Lakers[1][2][5]\n- Chicago held home-court advantage with a 3-game home winning streak[3][5][8]\n- Dallas faced significant roster challenges including injuries to Kyrie Irving and others[2][4][6]\n- Predictive models favored the Bulls, with Dimers.com giving them a 62% win probability[12] and Fox Sports predicting a 118-116 Bulls victory[13]\n\nGiven the event date has passed (current timestamp: March 30, 2025 2:25:22 AM UTC) and no cancellation notices appear in the sources, the resolution follows the ancillary data protocol to assume the **most probable outcome** based on available evidence. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
