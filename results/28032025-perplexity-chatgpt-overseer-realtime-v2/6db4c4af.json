        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Trump mentioned \"Epstein\" between March 21 and March 28, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Trump saying \"Epstein\" during that specific timeframe. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the period in question is the week leading up to March 28. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of the sources are from before March 21. For example, source [1] is from March 17, where Trump talks about releasing Epstein files. Source [10] is also from March 17, mentioning his comments on releasing JFK and Epstein files. Source [6] is from March 4, discussing Bondi's handling of the Epstein files. \n\nThere's a source [15] dated March 20, which talks about the DOJ pushing the FBI to release more Epstein files under Bondi's pressure. However, this article doesn't mention Trump himself saying \"Epstein\" during the specified dates. It's more about the DOJ's actions. \n\nAnother relevant source is [13] and [14], both from February 28, 2025, which mention Trump's name in the released Epstein flight logs. But these are from February, outside the March 21-28 window. \n\nSource [4] is a video from March 14, where Trump discusses releasing records on Epstein, JFK, and MLK. But again, March 14 is before the market's start time of March 21. \n\nI need to check if there's any mention in the search results of Trump mentioning \"Epstein\" between March 21 and March 28. The latest sources are [15] from March 20 and [1] from March 17. There's no information in the provided search results indicating that Trump made any public statements, either verbally or in writing, mentioning \"Epstein\" during the exact date range specified. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that the mention must be within the timeframe, and alternative spellings or minor misspellings are considered. However, without any evidence in the search results of a mention during those dates, the resolution should default to \"No\". \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, there's no verifiable instance of Trump mentioning \"Epstein\" between March 21 and March 28, 2025. The market should resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results, there is no verifiable evidence that Donald Trump mentioned \"Epstein\" between March 21, 2025 (6:10 PM ET) and March 28, 2025 (11:59 PM ET). While Trump discussed Epstein-related files multiple times in March 2025 ([1][4][10][15]), these discussions occurred **before** the market's qualifying timeframe:\n\n- March 17, 2025: Trump stated Epstein files \"are going to be released\" during an interview ([1][10])\n- March 14, 2025: Discussed Epstein records in a televised interview ([4])\n- March 20, 2025: DOJ efforts to review Epstein files were reported, but no direct Trump statements ([15])\n\nThe latest confirmed Trump comments about Epstein in the search results occurred on March 17 - four days **before** the market's March 21 start date. No social media posts, speeches, or verified statements containing \"Epstein\" (or acceptable variants) have been documented within the March 21-28 window.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It correctly identifies that the event in question is whether Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Epstein\" between March 21 and March 28, 2025. The response thoroughly checks for any mentions within this timeframe and correctly concludes that there were no mentions based on the evidence available.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically searching for instances of Trump mentioning \"Epstein\" within the specified dates and correctly identifying that all mentions occurred before the start date of March 21, 2025. The response also correctly applies the rules regarding pluralization, possessives, and minor misspellings as outlined in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies that no event (mention of \"Epstein\") occurred within the specified timeframe and aligns its recommendation with this fact. The recommendation of p1 (No) is based on the absence of any verified mentions of \"Epstein\" by Trump during the specified period, which is consistent with the ancillary data provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or missing information in the response. The response adequately covers the necessary details to make an informed decision based on the evidence provided.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation aligns with the facts verified during the analysis.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the instructions, logically analyzes the available information, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided information to verify the absence of the event in question within the specified timeframe and makes an accurate recommendation based on this analysis.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743411218 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 08:53:38 UTC",
