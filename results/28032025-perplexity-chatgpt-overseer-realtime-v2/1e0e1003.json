        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Michigan State will make the 2025 Final Four, and the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if they do, \"No\" (p1) if they don't. The current date is March 30, 2025, 11:32 PM UTC. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game between Michigan State and Auburn in the Elite Eight has already happened. The search results mention the game is scheduled for March 30 at 5:05 PM ET. Since the current time is 11:32 PM UTC, which is 7:32 PM ET, the game should have concluded. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no direct mention of the game's outcome. However, sources [1], [4], [6], and [15] all discuss the upcoming Elite Eight game between Michigan State and Auburn. Since the game was set for 5:05 PM ET on March 30 and the current time is past that, but the search results don't provide the result, I need to infer based on available info. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the team is eliminated, the market resolves to \"No\". If there's no info, but the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. However, without explicit confirmation, the safe approach is to check if the game's result is available. Since the provided search results don't include the outcome (all are from before the game), and the user hasn't provided updates, I can't confirm Michigan State's advancement. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is March 30, 11:32 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. The absence of result in the search results might mean the data isn't updated. However, according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions say if no info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome unless contradicted. But without any sources confirming the result, it's unclear. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization rules state that if the event is in the past and no info is available, default to p4. Wait, no: the rules say if the event is in the past but no verifiable info, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But if the outcome can't be inferred, default to p4. \n\nBut the problem here is that the search results don't include the game's result. All sources are from before the game. Therefore, according to the rules, since the event date is in the past (March 30) and no verifiable info is available, but the user hasn't provided updates, we have to assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions also mention that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time, it's still future. Wait, the game was at 5:05 PM ET, and the current time is 11:32 PM UTC, which is 7:32 PM ET. So the game has already occurred. \n\nBut without any search results indicating the outcome, we can't confirm. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, we should resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says the resolution source is official NCAA info. Since the search results don't have the outcome, and we can't access real-time data, we have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, but the user prompt doesn't specify postponement, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game is still ongoing? But the time is past. Since the search results don't have the result, and the user hasn't provided it, we can't confirm. Therefore, according to the rules, if the outcome can't be verified, resolve to p4. But the user's instructions also say that if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's impossible. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past (March 30), but the search results don't have the outcome. Therefore, we can't verify. So we have to default to p4. But wait, the user's query includes ancillary data that says if the team is eliminated, resolve to \"No\". If the game was played and they lost, then it's \"No\". But without knowing the result, we can't confirm. Therefore, since the event date is in the past and no info is available, but the user hasn't provided updates, we have to default to p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user didn't provide any URLs in the query, so we rely on the provided search results. Since none of the search results mention the outcome of the Michigan State vs. Auburn game, and the event date is in the past, we have to conclude that there's no verifiable information, hence resolve to p4. \n\nWait, but the current date is March 30, 2025, 11:32 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 30 at 5:05 PM ET (which is 21:05 UTC). So the game occurred on March 30, 2025, at 21:05 UTC, and the current time is 23:32 UTC, which is two hours later. The game would have ended, but the search results don't include the outcome. Therefore, according to the rules, since the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, but the user hasn't provided updates, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the resolution is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe Michigan State Spartans faced the Auburn Tigers in the Elite Eight of the 2025 NCAA Tournament on March 30, 2025, at 5:05 p.m. ET in Atlanta. The game determined which team would advance to the Final Four. However, **the provided search results do not include the outcome of this specific game**, as all sources were published prior to the tip-off time. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if the event date has passed and no verifiable information is available, the market resolves based on the most probable outcome. However, without official confirmation from the NCAA or updated sources confirming the result, it is **impossible to definitively determine whether Michigan State advanced**. \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Michigan State will make the 2025 Final Four is generally well-structured and adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response correctly identifies the need to verify the outcome of a specific event (the game between Michigan State and Auburn) and acknowledges the absence of direct information about the game's result at the time of the query. The decision to recommend p4 (cannot resolve at this time) is based on the lack of available verified information post-event, which aligns with the guidelines that stipulate resolution should be based on concrete evidence.\n\nHowever, there are several critical points to consider:\n\n1. Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions: The response accurately follows the instructions by checking if the event has occurred and by looking for verified outcomes. It correctly notes the absence of results in the search findings and adheres to the stipulation to resolve based on the most probable outcome when no information is available, but eventually defaults to p4 due to the lack of verifiable data.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness: The reasoning process is thorough, considering various scenarios and rules provided in the prompt. However, the response could be seen as somewhat circular and repetitive, especially in the internal deliberation about whether to default to p4 or infer the most probable outcome. This could be streamlined for clarity and efficiency.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts: The response does well to verify that the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp and that no post-event information is available.

The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The current date is March 30, 2025, which is the same day as the Elite Eight game between Michigan State and Auburn.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any information about the outcome of the Michigan State vs. Auburn game. Looking through the sources:\n\n- Source [7] from CBS Sports mentions the game is scheduled for Sunday, March 30, 2025, at 5:05 p.m. ET. It's a preview, so no result yet.\n- Source [8] from CBS Detroit, dated March 30, 2025, states that Michigan State lost to Auburn 64-70 in the Elite Eight, eliminating them from the tournament. This directly answers the query.\n- Other sources like [3], [6], [9], [10], [12], [14] discuss the lead-up to the game, Sweet 16 results, and the importance of the Elite Eight matchup but don't provide the result.\n- Source [8] is the only one that explicitly states the outcome, confirming Auburn's victory and Michigan State's elimination.\n\nSince the current timestamp is March 30, 2025, 11:33 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (5:05 p.m. ET, which is 9:05 PM UTC), the game has already taken place. Source [8] is a reliable news outlet reporting the result, so it's safe to conclude Michigan State did not advance. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nThe Michigan State Spartans were eliminated from the 2025 NCAA Tournament in the Elite Eight round, losing 64-70 to the Auburn Tigers on March 30, 2025[8]. This defeat occurred during the South Regional Final, which determined advancement to the Final Four. Since the Spartans were officially eliminated from the tournament at this stage, they cannot progress further in the competition.  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- The Elite Eight game concluded before the current timestamp of March 30, 2025, 11:33:49 PM UTC[8].  \n- Auburn advanced to the Final Four as the South Region champion, while Michigan State\u2019s tournament run ended[8].  \n- The NCAA\u2019s official bracket progression confirms elimination at this stage precludes Final Four participation[3][8].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively uses the information available from reliable sources to determine the outcome of the Michigan State vs. Auburn game, which is crucial for resolving the market query about Michigan State's advancement to the 2025 Final Four.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game between Michigan State and Auburn has already occurred by the current timestamp and uses a credible source (CBS Detroit) to confirm Michigan State's loss. This loss directly impacts the resolution of the market as Michigan State cannot advance to the Final Four, aligning with the resolution condition p1 for \"No.\"\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by verifying the game's outcome through a reliable source and correctly concludes that the market should resolve to \"No\" based on the event's outcome. The reasoning is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity, addressing previous feedback about circular reasoning.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using a source that reports the game result on the same day it occurred. This ensures that the information is up-to-date and relevant. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is fully justified by the factual outcome of the game.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The source used is specified and relevant, and the response focuses solely on the necessary details to resolve the query.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, there is no need for a rerun or further refinement.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743377374 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-30 23:29:34 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease refine the search strategy to check for any new updates or results related to the Michigan State vs. Auburn game that might have been posted after the initial search.
