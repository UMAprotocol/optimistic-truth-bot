The ancillary data says \"Yes\" is p2 and \"No\" is p1. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any information about Michigan State's elimination. Looking through the sources, several articles mention the outcome of the game between Auburn and Michigan State. \n\nSearch result [1] states that Auburn defeated Michigan State 70-64 in the Elite Eight, securing their spot in the Final Four. Similarly, [3], [5], [6], [8], [9], [12], and [13] all confirm that Michigan State lost to Auburn in the Elite Eight round on March 30, 2025. Since the Elite Eight is the round before the Final Four, a loss here means Michigan State was eliminated and cannot advance further. \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that if the team is eliminated, the market resolves to \"No\" (p1). All the sources agree that Michigan State was eliminated in the Elite Eight, so they didn't make the Final Four. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the game date, so there's no chance of them advancing now. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nAuburn defeated Michigan State 70-64 in the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight on March 30, 2025, eliminating the Spartans from championship contention[1][3][6][12][13]. This loss occurred before the Final Four stage, making it impossible for Michigan State to advance further in the tournament[6][9][12]. The game featured a dominant 17-0 first-half run by Auburn and a standout performance from Johni Broome (25 points, 14 rebounds)[3][5][8].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Michigan State entered as a No. 2 seed[6][11]\n- Auburn was the No. 1 overall tournament seed[12]\n- This marked Tom Izzo's 15th Elite Eight appearance with Michigan State[7]\n- The Spartans shot 34% from the field and 30% from three-point range[9]\n\nAs the elimination occurred before the Final Four and the current date (March 31, 2025) is past the event date, Michigan State cannot qualify for the 2025 Final Four under NCAA tournament rules. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that Michigan State was eliminated from the NCAA tournament before reaching the Final Four, based on multiple sources confirming their loss to Auburn in the Elite Eight. This factual information is directly relevant to the query and adheres to the instruction to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically concludes that since Michigan State was eliminated in the Elite Eight, they did not advance to the Final Four, thus the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The reasoning is supported by specific details from the match, including the final score and key performances, which enhances the completeness of the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event (Michigan State's elimination in the Elite Eight) using multiple sources and correctly aligns the recommendation (p1) with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743412415 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 09:13:35 UTC"
