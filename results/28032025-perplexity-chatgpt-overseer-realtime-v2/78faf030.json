        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Rodr\u00edguez vs. Borjas fight at UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Rodr\u00edguez wins, it's p2; if Borjas wins, p1; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 29, p3. The current date is March 29, 2025, 11:36 PM UTC, which is the same day as the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. Since the current time is late evening on March 29, and the fight was scheduled for the same day, I need to confirm the exact timing. The search results mention the main card starts at 7 PM ET (which is UTC-4), so 7 PM ET would be 11 PM UTC. The current time is 11:36 PM UTC, which is 7:36 PM ET. So the event is ongoing or just concluded.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mix of pre-fight analyses and some live coverage. Result [9] from ESPN's fight center has a timestamp of 0:35 with Jamall Emmers securing a TKO win in the first round, which suggests that the preliminary card is underway. However, there's no direct mention of the Rodr\u00edguez vs. Borjas fight result yet. \n\nResult [10] from MMA Junkie mentions that the fight is part of the main card opener, expected around 7 PM ET. Since the current time is past that, the fight might have already happened. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of Rodr\u00edguez vs. Borjas. \n\nSome sources like [8], [10], [14], and [16] predict Rodr\u00edguez as the favorite, while [4] and [10] suggest Borjas could be competitive. However, predictions aren't results. Without a confirmed result from a reliable source like ESPN (the resolution source), I can't definitively resolve the market. \n\nSince the event is on the same day and the fight was scheduled, but there's no explicit result in the provided sources, and the current time is just after the main card start, it's possible the result isn't reported yet. However, the user's current timestamp is 11:36 PM UTC, which is after the main card start. If the fight occurred and the result is available, but not in the provided sources, I might have to default to p3. But according to the resolution conditions, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThe majority of predictions favor Rodr\u00edguez. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is today and the fight might still be ongoing or results not yet reported, it's safer to check if the event is considered past. Since the current time is after the scheduled start, but the exact fight time isn't specified beyond \"around 7 PM ET,\" which is 11 PM UTC, and it's now 11:36 PM UTC, the fight might have concluded. However, without explicit results in the sources, the safe resolution is p3 (unknown/50-50) as per the conditions. But wait, the resolution conditions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. However, the event is today, and the fight might not have happened yet. Wait, the user's current time is March 29, 11:36 PM UTC, which is the same day as the event. The fight was scheduled for March 29. If the fight was supposed to happen earlier and the result isn't available, but the event is over, then we might need to go with the probable outcome. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But if the event is on the same day but the time hasn't passed, it's still future. Wait, the fight was scheduled for March 29, 2025. The current time is March 29, 11:36 PM UTC. The main card started at 7 PM ET (11 PM UTC), so the fight would have occurred around that time. If the sources don't have the result, but the event is over, the resolution would depend on whether the fight was completed. Since the provided search results don't include the outcome, and the user's timestamp is after the event, but no result is found, the resolution would be p3. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the event is today, so it's possible the result isn't reported yet. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3 (50-50) because the outcome isn't verifiable yet. But wait, the user's current time is March 29, 11:36 PM UTC, which is after the main card start. If the fight was part of the main card opener, it might have already happened. However, without explicit results in the sources, I can't confirm. Therefore, the recommendation is p3. But some sources like [9] mention Jamall Emmers' TKO win, which is part of the prelims, but no mention of Rodr\u00edguez vs. Borjas. Since the user's personalization says to resolve based on verifiable facts, and there's no verifiable result, the recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night: Moreno vs. Erceg event occurred on March 29, 2025, with the Ronaldo Rodr\u00edguez vs. Kevin Borjas flyweight bout scheduled as the main card opener. Based on the provided search results, no verifiable outcome for this specific fight is documented in the sources. While pre-fight analyses leaned toward Rodr\u00edguez as the favorite due to his momentum and home advantage[8][10][14], the resolution requires confirmation from ESPN or credible reporting, which is absent in the available data.  \n\nGiven the event date aligns with the current timestamp and no conclusive result is reported, the resolution defaults to the ancillary condition for unresolved outcomes.  \n\n**recommendation: p3**",
