        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about the resolution of a market based on the MLB game between the Boston Red Sox and Texas Rangers on March 28, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Rangers, p2 is Red Sox, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check the game's date. The current date given is March 29, 2025, so the game in question (March 28) has already occurred. That means I don't have to worry about future postponements or suspensions. \n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find the outcome of the March 28 game. Let's go through each source:\n\n- Result [1] from March 28 mentions the Red Sox won 5-2 on Opening Day, which was March 27. That's the first game of the series.\n- Result [2] (ESPN recap) shows the Rangers won 4-1 on March 28. The box score here clearly states the final score as Rangers 4, Red Sox 1.\n- Result [6] (CBS News) confirms the Rangers' 4-1 victory on March 28, with Heim hitting two homers and Leiter getting his first win.\n- Result [7] (FanDuel) also states that Jack Leiter earned the win for the Rangers against the Red Sox on March 28 with a 4-1 score.\n- Result [8] (ESPN) lists the March 27 game as Red Sox 5-2 and the March 28 game as Rangers 4-1.\n- Result [9] (NBC Sports) discusses the March 29 game but mentions the previous game where Rangers won 4-1 on March 28.\n\nAll these sources consistently report that the Rangers won the March 28 game 4-1. There's no mention of the game being postponed, suspended, or tied. The official outcome as per MLB rules would therefore be a Rangers victory. \n\nSince the resolution conditions state p1 corresponds to Rangers, the correct recommendation is p1. There's no ambiguity here because the game was completed, and the Rangers were declared the official winner.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Red Sox and Texas Rangers played their scheduled MLB game on March 28, 2025, at Globe Life Field. According to multiple verified sources, the **Texas Rangers defeated the Boston Red Sox 4-1**[2][6][7]. Key factors in the Rangers' victory included:\n\n- **Jonah Heim** hitting two solo home runs[6]\n- Rookie pitcher **Jack Leiter** earning his first career win with 5 innings pitched, allowing 1 run on 5 hits[6][7]\n- Texas' bullpen combining for 4 scoreless innings of relief[6]\n\nThe game was completed without postponement or suspension, and the outcome was officially recorded by MLB. Based on the resolution conditions where p1 corresponds to a Rangers victory, this market resolves to:\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743238717 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-29 08:58:37 UTC",
