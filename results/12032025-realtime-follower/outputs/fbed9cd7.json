  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether Russia will recapture Sudzha's railroad station by June 30, 2025. Let me start by checking the current status of Sudzha and the station. \n\nFirst, looking at the search results, there are several key points. The Ukrainian Armed Forces initially captured Sudzha in August 2024, including the railway station, which was a significant logistics hub for Russia [1][8][9]. However, recent reports from March 2025 indicate that Russian forces have made advances in the Kursk region. \n\nFrom source [3], the DeepState map updated on March 12 shows that Sudzha is no longer under Ukrainian control, with only the western part in a \"gray zone.\" Source [10] confirms that Ukrainian troops have fully withdrawn from Sudzha, and Russian forces now control the town. Additionally, source [13] mentions that Russian forces have seized areas around Sudzha, including Bondarevka, Zamostye, and Makhnovka, which are nearby. The ISW reports in sources [11], [13], and [18] detail Russian advances, including attacks through a gas pipeline and the capture of surrounding villages, leading to the collapse of Ukrainian positions in the northern part of the Kursk salient.\n\nThe railway station's status is crucial. Initially, Ukraine's capture of the station disrupted Russian logistics [1][8]. However, recent Russian advances suggest they are retaking territory. Source [10] states that Russian forces have taken Sudzha, which would likely include the railway station. The ISW's interactive map (as referenced in the query) would show the station as under Russian control if shaded red. Since the current date in the personalization is March 12, 2025, and the resolution date is June 30, there's still time, but the recent withdrawal of Ukrainian forces and Russian control as of March 12 makes it probable that the station is already under Russian control. \n\nHowever, I need to confirm if the station's icon on the ISW map is shaded red. The search results don't provide a live map, but source [10] and [13] indicate that Sudzha is under Russian control as of March 12. Since the station is part of Sudzha, it's reasonable to conclude it's now under Russian control. Unless there's a Ukrainian counterattack before June 30, which isn't indicated, the station should remain in Russian hands. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if Russia captures the station by June 30, it's a \"Yes.\" Given the current information, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). But wait, the user's note says the current timestamp is March 12, 2025. The event in question is whether Russia will recapture it by June 30, which is a future date. However, according to the latest updates, Russia has already retaken Sudzha as of March 12. Therefore, the station is already captured, so the answer is \"Yes.\" The market should resolve to \"Yes\" because the condition is met before June 30. However, I must ensure that the specific railway station is included in the captured area. Source [8] mentions the Sudzha railway station's strategic importance and its capture by Ukraine in August 2024. Now that Russia controls Sudzha as of March 12, the station would logically be under their control. \n\nTherefore, the answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
