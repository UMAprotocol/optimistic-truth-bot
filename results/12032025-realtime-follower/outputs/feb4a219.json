  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741841926\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 05:58:46",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a prediction market about the outcome of the NBA game between the New York Knicks and Portland Trail Blazers scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins the game. The current date and time given are March 13, 2025, 05:55:48, which is just a few hours after the game's scheduled time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already occurred. The search results include sources from March 12 and 13, 2025. Looking at result [14], the play-by-play data from ESPN shows specific game events, like Josh Hart missing a three-pointer and Mikal Bridges making a shot. The final score mentioned is Knicks 114, Trail Blazers 113. This indicates that the game took place and concluded with the Knicks winning by one point. \n\nOther sources like [1], [5], and [7] provide pre-game predictions and analysis, all pointing towards the Knicks being favored. However, since the game has already happened, the key source is the play-by-play data in [14], which confirms the Knicks' victory. \n\nI must ensure that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. The detailed play-by-play and final score confirm the game was completed. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Knicks\" (p2). No conflicting information suggests a different outcome, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
