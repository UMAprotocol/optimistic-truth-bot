  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741817507\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:11:47",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Donald Trump said \"Beautiful\" three or more times during his press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Prime Minister of Ireland, on March 12, 2025. The user provided a bunch of search results, and I have to use those to determine if the answer is \"Yes\" (p2), \"No\" (p1), or uncertain (p3). But according to the personalization instructions, if the event hasn't happened yet or there's no verified information, I have to return p4. Wait, but the current timestamp given is March 12, 2025, 23:07:21, which is 10:07 PM ET. The press conference was scheduled for 5 PM ET on the same day. So the event should have already occurred. But I need to check the search results for any mention of the press conference and whether Trump used \"beautiful\" three times.\n\nLooking at the search results, let's go through them one by one. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions that the Taoiseach met Trump at the White House, had a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, and later attended the Friends of Ireland Luncheon and the St. Patrick's Day reception at 5 PM. The reception is where the shamrock presentation happens. There's a mention of Trump's use of \"beautiful\" in [2], which is a 2024 article about Trump's frequent use of the word. But that's historical and not specific to this event. \n\nResult [6] talks about Trump trying to pronounce \"Taoiseach\" and discussing trade issues, but no mention of \"beautiful.\" Result [8] links to a live stream of the St. Patrick's Day reception at 5 PM ET, which is the event in question. However, the content from the live stream isn't detailed in the search results. \n\nResult [14] mentions the shamrock ceremony at 5 PM in the East Room. Result [15] includes a quote from Trump accusing Ireland of taking US pharmaceutical companies, but again no mention of \"beautiful.\" Result [16] and [17] are live blogs and updates but don't provide transcripts of the press conference. \n\nResult [18] is from 2019 where Trump used \"beautiful\" multiple times during a similar event. But that's from a previous administration. \n\nThe key here is whether any of the search results from March 12, 2025, specifically mention Trump using \"beautiful\" during the 5 PM reception. None of the provided search results include a transcript or direct quotes from the press conference or reception where Trump used the word \"beautiful\" three times. The closest is result [14], where the Taoiseach mentions Trump's \"beautiful golf club in Doonbeg,\" but that's part of a statement by the Taoiseach, not Trump himself during the event. \n\nSince the resolution source is supposed to be the video of the press conference, and the search results don't include any evidence of Trump saying \"beautiful\" three times during that specific event, I can't confirm that it happened. Even though Trump has a history of using the word frequently, without explicit evidence from the event, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp. But since the event was at 5 PM ET on March 12, and the current timestamp is 23:07:21 UTC (which is 6:07 PM ET), the event has already occurred. Wait, UTC is 5 hours ahead of ET. So March 12, 23:07:21 UTC is 6:07 PM ET. The event was at 5 PM ET, so it's already happened. Therefore, if there's no evidence in the search results, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future, but since it's past, and there's no confirmation in the sources, the correct resolution is \"No\" (p1). But wait, the market was updated to resolve based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. The search results mention the reception happening, but no quotes from Trump using \"beautiful\" there. Therefore, the answer is \"No,\" so p2 is for \"Yes,\" but since it's not confirmed, the answer should be p1. Wait, resolution_conditions say p1 is No, p2 is Yes, p3 is 0.5. Since there's no evidence in the sources provided, and the event has already occurred, but the sources don't confirm the usage, the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Since it's in the past, but no sources confirm, perhaps the answer is p1. But the assistant must check if the event occurred and if there's verified information. Since the search results do not include any transcript or mention of Trump saying \"beautiful\" during that specific event, even though the event has occurred, the assistant can't verify it from the provided sources. Therefore, according to the rules, if there's no verified information, the answer should be p4. Wait, no. The personalization says if the event hasn't occurred yet, return p4. Since it has occurred, but there's no information, perhaps it's p3 (unknown). But the resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5. However, the instructions say that if the event has occurred but there's no definitive information, maybe it's p3. But the user's personalization says to return p4 only if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past, and there's no information, perhaps the answer is p1 (No) because the sources don't confirm it, assuming that absence of evidence is evidence of absence. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, if the event happened but there's no data, maybe it's p3. However, the assistant must base the answer strictly on the provided search results. Since none of the search results from the event on March 12, 2025, mention Trump using \"beautiful\" three times, the answer is \"No\" (p1). Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
