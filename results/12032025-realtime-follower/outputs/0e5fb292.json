  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741818329\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:25:29",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say \"NATO\" three or more times during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution data says p1 is No, p2 is Yes, p3 is 0.5. So I need to check if \"NATO\" was mentioned at least three times in that specific presser.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results provided. The key sources here are the ones related to the actual press conference. Let's see:\n\nIn search result [12], there's a video transcript snippet where Trump mentions NATO. He says, \"NATO's expended a lot of that money in fighting this horrible War,\" and later when asked if Ireland should join NATO, he replies, \"that's up to Ireland.\" That's two mentions right there. Wait, but the user's query is about the press conference on March 12, and the transcript from [12] is from that day. The user specified that the press conference is the event in question, not any preceding meetings. \n\nLooking at the YouTube transcript in [12], Trump discusses NATO's funding and mentions how he got countries to pay their bills. He uses the term NATO at least twice in that segment. Let me check again. The first mention is \"NATO's expended a lot of that money...\" Second, when asked about Ireland joining NATO, he says \"that's up to Ireland.\" Are there more instances?\n\nIn the same transcript, Trump also says, \"Now NATO's expended a lot of that money in fighting this horrible War...\" and \"NATO became much stronger...\" That's another mention. Wait, that's three times. Let me count:\n\n1. \"NATO's expended a lot of that money...\"\n2. \"NATO became much stronger...\"\n3. When asked about Ireland joining NATO, he refers to NATO again.\n\nSo that's three mentions. However, I need to confirm that these all occurred during the press conference part, not a preceding bilateral meeting. The user specified that only the press conference counts, not preceding meetings. The transcript in [12] is labeled as the bilateral meeting, but the title says \"LIVE: Pres. Trump holds bilateral meeting with leader of Ireland Miche\u00e1l Martin.\" The user's query mentions that the press conference is separate from the bilateral meeting, so I need to ensure the mentions are from the presser.\n\nWait, the resolution condition states: \"This market is explicitly about the scheduled press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin. Preceding bilateral meetings will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the press conference contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\"\n\nSo I need to check if the NATO mentions were during the press conference or the bilateral meeting. The transcript from [12] seems to be from the bilateral meeting, as it's titled \"bilateral meeting.\" Therefore, those mentions might not count. But maybe the press conference happened after, and the transcript includes both?\n\nLooking at the update provided: \"(1741790149, b\"This market\u2019s resolution will be based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception with the Taoiseach of Ireland scheduled to occur at 5 PM ET.\")\" So the event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. The press conference might be part of that event. However, the search results don't explicitly mention the press conference transcript, only the bilateral meeting. The video in [12] is a bilateral meeting, not the press conference. Therefore, unless there's another source that covers the actual press conference, the mentions in the bilateral meeting wouldn't count.\n\nBut wait, search result [13] from Sky News mentions Trump's remarks during the meeting with Martin in the Oval Office, where he criticizes the EU but doesn't mention NATO. The article says that during the meeting, Trump discussed trade issues but didn't bring up NATO. The transcript in [12] includes a Q&A where Trump talks about NATO, but if that's part of the bilateral meeting, it doesn't count. The press conference would be a separate event.\n\nSince the search results don't include a transcript of the actual press conference, and the provided sources only cover the bilateral meeting and other events, there's no evidence that Trump mentioned NATO three times during the press conference. The mentions in the bilateral meeting don't count per the query's resolution conditions. Therefore, without evidence from the press conference itself, the answer should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
