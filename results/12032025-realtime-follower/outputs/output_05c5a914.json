Mere announcements will not qualify.\n\nIf no executive order is published by 12:00 PM ET the day after the listed date of this market, this market will resolve to \"No\"\n\nIn the case of ambiguity this market will use the federal register as the resolution source (https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders).\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741803748\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 19:22:28",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will issue an executive order on March 11, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he signs one that day, with the order published on the White House's presidential actions page or through the press pool. If not, it's \"No\". The current date is March 12, 2025, 19:20:18 UTC, which is past the 12 PM ET deadline the next day. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any executive orders dated March 11, 2025. Looking at the search results, the most relevant ones are from the White House's presidential actions. Search result [10] lists actions up to March 11, 2025. It mentions \"Nominations Sent to the Senate\" and \"U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day, 2025\" under March 11. There's no mention of an executive order issued that day. \n\nOther search results like [11], [12], [13], and [14] discuss various executive orders from January and February 2025 but none on March 11. The latest mentioned in [10] is March 5, 2025, with subsequent actions on March 3, 2, and 1. Since the deadline has passed and no executive order was published for March 11, the resolution should be \"No\". \n\nI also need to ensure that announcements or other actions don't count\u2014only published executive orders. The user specified that executive actions don't qualify, so even if there were proclamations or memoranda, they wouldn't count. The sources don't show any executive order on March 11. Therefore, the answer is p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
