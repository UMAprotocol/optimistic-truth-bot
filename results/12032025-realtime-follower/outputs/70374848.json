  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741838635\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 05:03:55",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by looking at the user's query and the provided search results. The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Oklahoma vs. Georgia college basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Georgia, p2 for Oklahoma, and p3 for a 50-50 split if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current timestamp given is March 13, 2025, at 05:01:10, which is after the scheduled game time. So the game should have taken place. However, looking through the search results, most of them are previews, predictions, and analyses leading up to the game. There's no direct mention of the actual game result in any of the provided search results. \n\nFor example, the ESPN link (result 2) and CBS Sports (result 7) both mention the game as a preview, discussing team stats and previous meetings. The Sportsbook Review (result 6) and Cappertek (result 13) provide predictions and betting odds but no final score. Similarly, other sources like Dimers (result 9) and NBC Sports (result 14) also offer predictions without reporting the outcome. \n\nThe absence of any post-game reports in the search results is concerning. Since all the provided context is from before the game, there's no evidence confirming whether the game was played, postponed, or the result. The resolution rules state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, it resolves to p4. However, the current time is after the game's scheduled time, so it's not a future event anymore. But without any confirmation of the game's completion or result, we can't definitively resolve to p1 or p2.\n\nAdditionally, there's a mention in search result 4 about postponed events and the rules for such cases. If the game was delayed but not completed within the required timeframe, bets are void. However, there's no information here indicating a postponement or cancellation. \n\nGiven the lack of post-game data in the provided sources and the requirement to base the resolution strictly on verified facts, I can't confirm the outcome. The user instruction also specifies that if the event hasn't occurred yet (including the same day but later time), it should be p4. But here, the current time is past the game's scheduled time, yet there's no result available. This might imply the game was postponed or data isn't available, but without explicit confirmation, the safest resolution is p4 since there's no verifiable result. However, the resolution conditions don't include p4; instead, p3 is for canceled games. But the instructions say to use p4 for future events. This is a bit conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4... If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" However, the current time is after the game's scheduled time. So technically, the event is in the past. But since there's no information confirming the outcome, it's unclear. The instructions also mention to check if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp. Since it's not future, but there's no result, maybe it's considered unresolved. However, the resolution conditions mention p3 for canceled games. Without confirmation of cancellation, perhaps the market remains open. \n\nBut according to the oracle's rules, if the event hasn't occurred (even if it was supposed to), and there's no data, it's unresolved. However, the user's personalization requires using p4 only for future events. Since the event's scheduled time has passed, but there's no result, maybe it's an edge case. However, the instructions emphasize relying strictly on verified facts. Since none of the provided sources confirm the outcome, the resolution can't be determined from the given data. Therefore, the correct response would be p4, but the resolution conditions don't have p4. Wait, the query's resolution conditions are p1: Georgia, p2: Oklahoma, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is future, but since it's past, and no result is found, perhaps it's considered unknown. However, the resolution options given in the query are p1, p2, p3. The user's instruction says to return p4 for future events, but here the event is in the past. Since there's no data to confirm the result, but the game was supposed to have happened, maybe the market should resolve to p3 (50-50) if canceled, but without confirmation, it's unclear. However, the user instruction says to only use p4 for future events. Since the event is not future, but there's no result, perhaps the answer is p3. But the user's personalization says to use p4 for future events, which this isn't. Therefore, the correct approach is to check if the game was played. Since the provided sources don't show the result, but the current time is after the game, perhaps the game was played, but the result isn't in the provided context. In that case, the oracle can't resolve it based on the given information and should return p4. However, p4 isn't part of the resolution conditions provided (p1, p2, p3). This is a conflict. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4.\" So even though the resolution conditions in the query's ancillary data only mention p1, p2, p3, the personalization instructs to use p4 if the event is future. Since the event's scheduled time has passed, but there's no result in the provided search results, the correct resolution would be p3 (50-50) if canceled, but without confirmation, perhaps p3. However, according to the resolution conditions, p3 is for canceled games. If the game wasn't canceled, but the result isn't known, it's unclear. However, the user's instruction says to resolve based strictly on verified facts. Since there are no verified facts about the game's outcome in the provided sources, despite the current time being after the game, the resolution can't be determined, so the recommendation is p4. But p4 isn't part of the ancillary data's resolution options. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market should resolve to p3 if the game was canceled. But without evidence of cancellation, it's impossible to confirm. Given the conflict between the user's personalization (which mandates p4 for future events) and the ancillary data's resolution options, but the event is in the past, the correct approach is to check if the game was played. Since the provided search results don't include any post-game information, and the user's instructions require using only the provided context, the assistant can't verify the outcome. Therefore, based on the given data, the resolution should be p4 (as per the personalization) because the event's outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources, even though the time has passed. However, the personalization says p4 is for future events. But the event is in the past. This is a contradiction. \n\nIn this case, the assistant should follow the personalization's instruction: if the event hasn't occurred (even if it's supposed to have happened), and there's no verifiable information, it can't be resolved, hence p4. However, the personalization says p4 is for future events, but the event is in the past. This is a tricky situation. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should default to p3 (50-50) if the game's outcome isn't verifiable. But according to the personalization, p4 is strictly for future events. Since the event is in the past, but no result is found, perhaps the assistant should respond with p3. However, the resolution conditions state p3 is for canceled games. Without confirmation of cancellation, this isn't applicable. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the strict instructions to rely only on verified facts from the provided sources, and since none of the sources confirm the game's result, the assistant must conclude that the outcome cannot be verified. Therefore, the recommendation is p4, even though the event is in the past, because the resolution can't be determined from the given data. However, the personalization's p4 is intended for future events. This is a conflict. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach here is to note that the event was scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET, and the current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 5:01 AM UTC, which is after the game's time. However, without any post-game reports in the search results, the assistant can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, according to the oracle's rules, since the event's outcome isn't verifiable despite the time having passed, it's treated as unresolved and returns p4. But the personalization's p4 is for future events. This is a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should return p3, assuming the game was canceled, but there's no evidence of that. \n\nIn conclusion, given the strict instructions to only use verified facts and the absence of any post-game data in the provided search results, the assistant can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p4, as per the personalization's instruction for unresolved events, even though the event is in the past. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions don't include p4, which complicates things. But the user's personalization overrides, so the final answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
