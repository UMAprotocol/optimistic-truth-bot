  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741824221\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 01:03:41",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the MD Eastern Shore vs. Norfolk State CBB game on March 12, 2025. The current date is March 13, 2025, at 01:01:54, which is after the scheduled game time. Wait, the game was supposed to be on March 12 at 6 PM ET. The current timestamp is March 13, 1:01 AM UTC, which would be March 12 evening in Eastern Time. Wait, UTC is 5 hours ahead of Eastern Time. So March 13, 1:01 AM UTC is March 12, 8:01 PM Eastern Time. The game was scheduled for 6 PM ET on March 12. So the game should have already occurred.\n\nThe user provided search results, including game previews and predictions, but no actual post-game reports. The latest search result is from March 12, 2025, but none provide the final score. The ancillary data specifies that if the game happened, resolve based on the winner. Since the current time is after the game, I need to check if the game occurred and who won.\n\nLooking through the search results, the latest info is from March 12, but all are previews or predictions. For example, result [3] from foxsports.com has a boxscore link but the content is a preview. Similarly, [5] from nsuspartans.com is a preview article. There's no post-game coverage in the provided search results. \n\nSince the user's timestamp is after the game, but the search results don't include the actual outcome, the system must rely on available data. However, according to UMA's rules, if the event has occurred but there's no verifiable information, it might be tricky. But wait, the user's personalization says to use the current timestamp to check if the event is in the future. But the event was scheduled for March 12, 6 PM ET, which is before the current timestamp of March 13, 1:01 AM UTC (March 12, 8 PM ET). Therefore, the game has already taken place.\n\nHowever, the provided search results don't include the actual result. All sources are predictions or previews. Without verified post-game data, the oracle can't confirm the outcome. But according to the resolution conditions, if the game was canceled or postponed, it resolves accordingly. But there's no info suggesting cancellation. The absence of results in the provided context might mean that the data isn't available yet, but the system must answer based on given sources.\n\nIn this case, since the game time has passed but there's no conclusive evidence in the search results about the outcome, the system can't verify the result. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if the event's outcome can't be verified, it should resolve to p3 (50-50). However, the user's personalization says that if the event is in the future, use p4. But the event is in the past. The problem is that the provided sources don't have the actual result. \n\nWait, the user's instructions state: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4... If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it.\"\n\nBut in this case, the event was scheduled for March 12, 6 PM ET, which is before the current timestamp (March 13, 1:01 AM UTC). Therefore, the event is in the past. However, the search results provided don't include the actual outcome. The system must rely on available data. Since all sources are previews and predictions, and no post-game reports are present, there's no verified information. The user's instruction says to use the provided search results. But if the search results don't include the actual result, the system can't confirm the outcome. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"answer the Query as well as you can with existing knowledge.\" However, the system must base the answer on the provided search results. Since the search results don't include the actual game outcome, the system can't verify the result. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, if the game was canceled, resolve to p3. But there's no info on cancellation. Since the game was scheduled and there's no indication it was canceled, perhaps the system should default to the most probable outcome based on predictions. However, the user's instructions state that the oracle must resolve based on verified facts, not predictions. \n\nTherefore, if no verified result is available in the search results, the oracle can't confirm the outcome and must return p3 (unknown/50-50). However, the user's timestamp is after the game, but the provided sources don't have the result. Hence, the answer would be p3. But wait, the user's personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s).\" The user provided URLs, but none have the actual result. Therefore, despite the game being in the past, without verified sources, the answer is p3. \n\nBut another angle: Check if any of the provided URLs mention the game result. Let's look again. All the search results are from March 12 or earlier, and all are previews. For example, [3] is a boxscore link but the content is a preview. [14] is a live score page, but in the provided content, the live score data is unavailable. Therefore, there's no confirmation of the result. \n\nThus, the system can't verify the outcome based on provided sources. Therefore, the resolution should be p3. However, the user's personalization says that if the event has not occurred yet, use p4. But the event did occur (past the scheduled time), but there's no data. The instructions are a bit conflicting here. The correct approach is to check if the event has occurred. Since the current time is after the scheduled time, but no result is available, the system can't confirm, so it's unresolved. But according to the resolution conditions, if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If it's completed but no data, perhaps it's considered unknown. However, the user's instructions don't cover this scenario. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system should check the latest possible source. The latest source is [14], which is an ESPN live score page, but the data is unavailable. Without confirmation, the system can't resolve. Therefore, the answer is p3. But according to the user's instruction, the system must answer based on provided sources. Since the sources don't include the result, the system can't confirm and should return p3. \n\nBut another angle: Some of the predictions in the sources might have accurate results. For example, [2] predicts a 78-67 Norfolk State win, [9] predicts 81-64, [13] also 81-64. But predictions aren't verified facts. The oracle must resolve based on actual outcomes, not predictions. Therefore, despite the predictions, without actual results, the answer is p3. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it.\" The user provided URLs, but none have the result. Therefore, the system can't use them to confirm the outcome. Hence, the resolution is p3. However, the instructions also say that if the event is in the past but no sources, perhaps the system can't resolve. But the user's guidelines are strict: only use provided sources. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",
