  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the price of eggs went up in Trump's first month in office, specifically comparing February 2025 to January 2025. The resolution depends on the BLS CPI report released on March 12, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is March 12, 2025, 19:17:54, which is after the scheduled release of the February CPI report. That means the data should be available now. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the CPI release. Search result [9] and [10] are the BLS reports. The summary in [9] states that the CPI-U increased 0.2% in February, with the index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs rising 1.6% driven by a 10.4% increase in eggs. That's a clear indication that egg prices went up from January to February 2025.\n\nAdditionally, [11] mentions that egg prices reached a daily average of $8.15 per dozen in March 2025, up from previous records. However, the exact January and February figures are crucial. The CPI report in [9] specifies a 10.4% monthly increase in egg prices, which directly answers the query. \n\nThere might be conflicting info, like [1] suggesting prices could drop by summer, but the question is about February. The BLS data is definitive here. Since the February CPI shows an increase, the answer is \"Yes,\" so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\n# Analysis of Egg Price Trends in Early 2025 and Implications for Inflation\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on March 12, 2025, provides definitive evidence that egg prices increased between January and February 2025. The data shows a **10.4% month-over-month rise in the index for eggs** within the \"meats, poultry, fish, and eggs\" category, which experienced a 1.6% overall increase in February[9][10]. This surge occurred against a backdrop of broader inflationary pressures, with the all-items CPI rising 2.8% year-over-year and food prices increasing 2.6% over the same period[9][10].\n\n## Avian Influenza's Impact on Poultry Populations\nThe primary driver of egg price volatility stemmed from ongoing outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which decimated commercial layer flocks throughout 2024 and early 2025. Between 2022 and February 2025, HPAI outbreaks led to the culling of **127 million egg-laying hens**\u2014approximately 11% of the average annual layer inventory[11]. The most recent wave in January 2025 alone resulted in the loss of 44 million chickens, creating a 6-8 month production gap due to the biological timeline required to raise new laying hens[2][11].\n\n## Price Trajectory and Market Dynamics\nJanuary 2025 saw record-breaking egg prices at $7.09 per dozen nationally[2], with regional variations reaching $10.99 per dozen in high-cost markets like San Francisco[5]. While some analysts predicted price stabilization by mid-2025 as flocks repopulated[1], February's data confirmed continued upward pressure:\n- **Month-over-month increase**: 10.4% (BLS CPI)[9][10]\n- **Year-over-year increase**: 53% from January 2024 levels[1]\n- **Peak daily price**: $8.17 per dozen in early March 2025[11]\n\n## Political and Economic Ramifications\nThe price surge became a political flashpoint, with Democrats highlighting the **18% increase in egg prices** since Trump's January 2025 inauguration[8]. While avian influenza served as the primary catalyst, critics noted the administration's delayed response to:\n1. Supply chain vulnerabilities exposed by HPAI\n2. Labor shortages in poultry processing\n3. Regulatory impacts of California's Proposition 12[2][5]\n\n## Market Expectations vs Reality\nFutures markets and analysts had anticipated continued price increases, with:\n- 25% of Polymarket bets predicting prices above $6/dozen[4]\n- USDA projecting 41% annual price growth for 2025[5]\n- Truflation's real-time data suggesting inflationary pressures preceding official BLS reports[1]\n\nThe February CPI data validated these projections, showing eggs as a primary contributor to persistent food inflation despite moderating energy prices[9][10][12].\n\nrecommendation: p2",
