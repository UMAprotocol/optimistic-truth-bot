  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741818477\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:27:57",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say the word \"Letter\" during his press conference with Ireland's Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he uses that specific term during the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is March 12, 2025, 23:25:30 UTC, which is after the scheduled press conference. The press conference was part of the St. Patrick's Day events at the White House. \n\nLooking at the search results, several articles detail the meeting between Trump and Martin. The key sources are [3], [5], [6], [9], [12], [17], and [18]. These articles report on Trump's comments during the meeting, focusing on trade issues, tariffs, and Ireland's tax policies. \n\nIn the search results, there's mention of Trump discussing letters in other contexts, like the letter from Joe Biden ([11], [14]) and a letter from King Charles via Keir Starmer ([6], [18]). However, none of the sources mention Trump using the word \"Letter\" during the press conference with Martin. \n\nThe press conference mainly covered topics like trade imbalances, US companies in Ireland, and EU tariffs. For example, in [9], Trump criticizes Ireland's tax policies but doesn't mention a letter. Similarly, [12] and [17] detail the discussions but don't note the term \"Letter\" being used. \n\nSince all the provided sources focus on economic and trade discussions without any mention of Trump saying \"Letter\" during the event, the answer should be \"No\". The resolution condition here is p1 for No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
