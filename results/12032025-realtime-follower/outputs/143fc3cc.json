  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741809859\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 21:04:19",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Kevin O'Connell will be traded by 4 PM ET on March 12, 2025. The current date is March 12, 2025, and the time is 21:02:53 UTC, which is 5:02 PM ET. So the deadline has already passed.\n\nFirst, I need to check the latest information. The search results include articles up to March 12, 2025. Looking at result [15], the Vikings announced a multi-year extension with O'Connell on January 21, 2025. That's a key point\u2014he's already under a new contract. Then, result [17] from NFL.com confirms the extension, meaning he's not in the final year of his deal anymore. \n\nAlso, result [14] mentions that the extension was agreed upon, and Glazer defended his earlier report but the Vikings didn't trade him. The user's personalization instructions say to check if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since the current time is past the deadline, any reports after the deadline wouldn't count. \n\nLooking for any recent trades on March 12, the latest articles ([12], [13], [11]) discuss free agency moves, but none mention O'Connell being traded. The Vikings are focused on their QB situation with McCarthy. Since there's no official announcement or credible reports of a trade by the deadline, the answer should be \"No\". \n\nTherefore, the resolution is p1: No.\n</think>\n\n# Kevin O'Connell Trade Status: Resolution Analysis\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings and head coach Kevin O'Connell agreed to a multi-year contract extension on January 21, 2025, effectively removing him from the final year of his original deal and securing his position with the franchise[15][17]. This extension followed weeks of speculation fueled by reports from NFL insiders like Jay Glazer, who indicated multiple teams had expressed interest in trading for O'Connell[1][4][7]. However, the Vikings consistently denied any intention to trade their head coach, with a team source stating emphatically, *\"We love Kevin and there will be no trade\"*[16]. O'Connell himself publicly affirmed his commitment to Minnesota, stating, *\"This is where I want to be\"*[5][8]. \n\nBy the resolution deadline of March 12, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET, no credible reports or official announcements indicated a trade had occurred. The Vikings' focus shifted to offseason roster moves, including quarterback decisions involving J.J. McCarthy and free agent acquisitions[12][13]. Given the contractual resolution in January and the absence of subsequent trade activity, this market conclusively resolves to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
