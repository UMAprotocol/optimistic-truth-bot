  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741842653\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 06:10:53",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to determine the resolution of a market based on the outcome of a college basketball game between North Carolina Central and MD Eastern Shore scheduled for February 22 at 4:00 PM ET. The current date is March 13, 2025, so I need to check if the game has already occurred and what the result was.\n\nFirst, I look at the search results provided. Result [3] from CBS Sports and [9] from the UMES Hawks' official site both mention a game on February 26, 2025, where Maryland-Eastern Shore (MD Eastern Shore) defeated North Carolina Central 68-59. Additionally, result [5] from NCCU's site confirms the same outcome with a 68-59 loss for North Carolina Central on February 26. The AP article in [3] also states that the game happened on February 26, which is after the original date mentioned in the query (February 22). \n\nWait, the query mentions the game was scheduled for February 22, but the search results all refer to a game on February 26. This discrepancy is important. The user's market was based on the February 22 date, but the actual game was played on February 26. The resolution conditions state that if the game is postponed, the market remains open until completion. Since the game was played on a later date, it's considered postponed from the original date. However, the market should resolve based on the completed game.\n\nLooking at the outcome, MD Eastern Shore won 68-59 as per multiple sources. Therefore, the market should resolve to MD Eastern Shore (p1). However, I need to ensure that the game played on February 26 is indeed the same one that was originally scheduled for February 22. The search results don't explicitly mention a postponement, but the query's ancillary data refers to a February 22 game, while the actual game was on the 26th. This suggests the game was postponed. According to the resolution conditions, if postponed, the market remains open until completion. Since the game was completed on February 26, the result stands, and the market should resolve based on that outcome, which is MD Eastern Shore winning. Thus, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
