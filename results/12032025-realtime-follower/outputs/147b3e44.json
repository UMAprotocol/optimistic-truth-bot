  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741844510\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 06:41:50",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query and the context provided. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the UT Arlington vs. Grand Canyon college basketball game scheduled for March 12 at 11:30 PM ET. The current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 6:41:24 AM UTC, which is the next day. So the game was supposed to happen last night. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The resolution conditions state that if the game is postponed, the market remains open, and if canceled, it resolves to 50-50. The ancillary data mentions p1 for Grand Canyon winning, p2 for UT Arlington, and p3 for canceled. The user provided a URL, so I should check that source for the game's result.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, there's a link to ESPN's game summary. Let me parse that. The result shows the final score: Grand Canyon won 81-70. The game was played on March 12, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET. Since the current time is after the scheduled game time, the event has occurred. \n\nI need to verify that there's no postponement or cancellation. The ESPN link confirms the game was played, so no cancellation. Therefore, the market should resolve based on the actual outcome. Grand Canyon won, so the resolution should be p1. The final line should be \"recommendation: p1\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
