  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741841632\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 05:53:52",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking. They want to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the Anaheim Ducks vs. Utah Hockey Club game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The key here is to determine if the event has already occurred as of the current date and time, which is March 13, 2025, 05:52:45 UTC (that's 2025-03-13 05:52:45 in UTC). \n\nFirst, I need to check the time zones. The game was scheduled for March 12 at 10:00 PM ET. Eastern Time (ET) is UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving time. Since the date is March, which is during daylight saving time, ET would be UTC-4. So 10:00 PM ET on March 12 translates to March 13, 2:00 AM UTC. \n\nThe current timestamp given is March 13, 2025, 05:52:45 UTC, which is several hours after the scheduled game time. Therefore, the game should have already taken place. However, I need to verify if there's any information in the search results indicating the outcome of the game.\n\nLooking through the provided search results, most of them are previews or predictions made before the game. For example, sources [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [11], and [12] are all previews or predictions dated March 12, 2025, but no actual results. However, source [10] is a YouTube video titled \"Utah vs Anaheim Ducks | NHL (03/12/2025) NHL\" with a transcript that includes live commentary of the game. \n\nAnalyzing the transcript from source [10], there are mentions of the game's progress. For instance, at 838600 milliseconds (around 14 minutes into the third period), the transcript states \"anaheim's ahead one nothing.\" Later, near the end, it mentions \"less than 60 seconds to play in this tight one\" with the score still 1-0 in favor of Anaheim. The final moments describe Anaheim maintaining their lead, and the game ends with a 1-0 victory for the Ducks.\n\nSince the game has concluded and the Ducks won 1-0 according to the live commentary in source [10], the resolution should be in favor of the Ducks. However, I need to ensure that this source is reliable. The YouTube video's transcript provides a detailed play-by-play, which seems credible as a live game account. Additionally, the other sources do not report the result because they are all pre-game content. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence from source [10], the Anaheim Ducks won the game. The market should resolve to \"Ducks,\" corresponding to p2. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event has occurred, the correct resolution should be based on the outcome. Since the game happened and the Ducks won, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
