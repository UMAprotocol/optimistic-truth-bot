  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741818568\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-12 23:29:28",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say \"Saudi Arabia\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the exact term is mentioned. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The main sources are news articles and videos from that day. Let me go through each one to see if there's any mention of Trump saying \"Saudi Arabia\" during the event.\n\nLooking at the first few results [1][2][3][4], they discuss the meeting between Trump and Martin, focusing on trade tensions, tariffs, and the situation in Ukraine and Gaza. The term \"Saudi Arabia\" isn't mentioned here. \n\nResult [4] is a YouTube video where Trump adds pressure on Putin for a ceasefire, but the context is Ukraine. The transcript snippets don't show Trump mentioning Saudi Arabia. \n\nResult [7] mentions that Martin is the first EU leader to meet Trump since talks with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia. Wait, that's interesting. The U.S. and Ukraine had talks in Saudi Arabia, but does that come up in the press conference? The article says Martin's visit is part of the St. Patrick's Day events and mentions the EU's countertariffs. However, there's no direct quote from Trump about Saudi Arabia during the presser.\n\nResult [9] and [11] are from 2017 and relate to Trump's past speeches in Saudi Arabia, which isn't relevant to the 2025 event. \n\nResult [15] mentions the EU's countertariffs and the Ukraine ceasefire but doesn't reference Saudi Arabia in the context of the press conference. \n\nThe key here is that the press conference is specifically with the Irish PM. The user specified that only the press conference counts, not preceding meetings. The search results focus on topics like trade, tariffs, Ukraine, and Gaza. There's a mention of Saudi Arabia in the context of previous talks, but no indication Trump brought it up during the presser. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution source is the video of the press conference. The provided search results include a YouTube video [8] titled \"FULL: President Trump meets with Irish PM marking St. Patrick's Day.\" Let me check that. The description says Trump answered questions about the Department of Education, tariffs, Rosie O'Donnell moving to Ireland, etc. The transcript snippets from other videos don't mention Saudi Arabia. \n\nSince none of the sources indicate Trump said \"Saudi Arabia\" during the press conference, the answer should be \"No.\" Also, the current date is March 12, 2025, and the event has already occurred. All available information suggests the term wasn't used.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
