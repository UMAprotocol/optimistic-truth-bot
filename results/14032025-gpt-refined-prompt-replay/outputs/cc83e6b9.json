  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Israel\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles from the event. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at source [4], during the meeting with Martin, Trump mentioned Israel several times. He talked about Israel being under siege and the October 7 attacks. Direct quotes include: \u201cIsrael has been under siege, but you can see they had to fight back. Oct. 7 was a terrible thing...\" and \u201cWe\u2019re working hard with Israel. We\u2019re working hard to see if we can solve the problem...\u201d This clearly shows he used the word \"Israel.\"\n\nSource [11] also mentions Trump discussing Israel and the hostages, again using the term \"Israel.\" Similarly, source [13] reports Trump's comments on Israel's actions and his administration's efforts. \n\nIn the YouTube transcript from source [7], Trump is quoted saying, \u201cIsrael has been under siege as you can see and uh they had to fight back October 7th was a terrible thing...\u201d Here, he explicitly says \"Israel.\"\n\nAdditionally, source [12] includes a Sky News report where Trump discusses Israel's situation, though the exact term isn't quoted, but given the context, it's likely he used \"Israel.\" However, the direct evidence from other sources is sufficient.\n\nAll these instances occur during the press conference with the Irish PM. The resolution criteria state that any usage of \"Israel\" during the event counts, regardless of context. Since multiple sources confirm Trump used the term, the answer should be \"Yes,\" corresponding to p2.\n</think>\n\nDuring the March 12, 2025, press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, Donald Trump explicitly mentioned \"Israel\" multiple times. He referenced Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 attacks, stating, *\u201cIsrael has been under siege, but you can see they had to fight back. Oct. 7 was a terrible thing\u201d*[4][7][13]. Trump also discussed U.S. collaboration with Israel, saying, *\u201cWe\u2019re working hard with Israel. We\u2019re working hard to see if we can solve the problem\u201d*[4][7]. These remarks occurred during the bilateral meeting and subsequent press engagement, fulfilling the market\u2019s criteria for resolution.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
