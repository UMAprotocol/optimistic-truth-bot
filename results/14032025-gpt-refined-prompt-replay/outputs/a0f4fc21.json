  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Hornets vs. Hawks game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on which team won. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The system mentions it's March 14, 2025, 7:52 PM UTC. The game was on March 12, which is two days prior, so the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources confirm the game's outcome. Source [1] states the Hawks defeated the Hornets 123-110. Source [4] and [6] also mention the Hawks' victory with Trae Young's standout performance. Source [9] from CBS Sports and the Associated Press report the same score, emphasizing Young's 35 points and 12 assists. Additionally, source [12] lists the final score as Hawks 123, Hornets 110, and source [14] notes LaMelo Ball's 25 points in the loss.\n\nAll these sources consistently report the Hawks as the winner. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event occurred and the Hawks won, the market should resolve to \"Hawks,\" corresponding to p1. The final recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks defeated the Charlotte Hornets 123-110 on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][4][6][9][12]. Trae Young led the Hawks with 35 points and 12 assists, while Miles Bridges scored 31 points for the Hornets in the losing effort[1][4][9]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the Hawks secured their fourth consecutive win[6][9]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
