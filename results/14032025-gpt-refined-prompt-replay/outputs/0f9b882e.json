  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how a prediction market should resolve based on the outcome of the Fresno State vs. Nevada basketball game scheduled for March 12. The resolution conditions are p1 for Nevada, p2 for Fresno State, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually happened on March 12, 2025. Looking at the search results, multiple sources like [1], [2], [5], [7], [8], and [10] confirm that the game took place on that date. The detailed recaps mention the final score as Nevada 86-71 Fresno State. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome. All the sources agree that Nevada won. For example, [1] states \"Nevada Rolls Past Fresno State in MW Tournament Opener\" with the score 86-71. [2] from ESPN also reports the same score and outcome. Additionally, [7] and [8] from Nevada Sports Net provide detailed accounts of the game, including key players' performances and stats, all confirming Nevada's victory.\n\nThe user also mentioned checking if the event was scheduled for a future date. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after March 12. Since the game has already occurred and Nevada won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources consistently report Nevada's win, so there's no ambiguity. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Fresno State vs. Nevada men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 4:30 PM ET **has already occurred**, with Nevada defeating Fresno State 86-71 in the Mountain West Tournament opener[1][2][5][7][8]. Multiple sources confirm the game was played as scheduled at Las Vegas' Thomas & Mack Center, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Nevada led wire-to-wire, using a 22-3 first-half run to establish control and maintaining a double-digit advantage throughout the second half[7][8].\n\n**Key game details**:\n- Final score: Nevada 86, Fresno State 71[1][2][5]\n- Nevada's Kobe Sanders led all players with 17 points, 10 assists, and 7 rebounds[2][5]\n- The Wolf Pack dominated paint scoring (48-26) and rebounding (42-33)[7][10]\n- This marked Nevada's largest MW Tournament victory (15 points)[1]\n\nAs the game was completed as scheduled with a decisive Nevada victory, the market should resolve to **p1 (Nevada)** based on the stated resolution conditions. There is no evidence of postponement or cancellation that would trigger alternative resolution scenarios.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
