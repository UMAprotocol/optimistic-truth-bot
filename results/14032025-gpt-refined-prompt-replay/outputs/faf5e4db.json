  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how a specific market will resolve based on the outcome of the South Carolina vs. Arkansas game on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Arkansas, p2 for South Carolina, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after March 12. So the game should have taken place. Now, looking at the search results, several sources ([1], [2], [5], [8]) report that Arkansas defeated South Carolina 72-68 in the SEC Tournament on March 12. \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game occurred as scheduled. Therefore, the market should resolve to Arkansas winning, which corresponds to p1. There's no indication of the game being incomplete or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here. All the evidence points to Arkansas being the winner, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Arkansas Razorbacks defeated the South Carolina Gamecocks 72-68 in their SEC Tournament first-round game on March 12, 2025. Arkansas led by as many as 20 points in the second half before surviving a late South Carolina rally, with key contributions from Trevon Brazile (16 points, 7 rebounds) and Johnell Davis (14 points, clutch free throws)[1][2][5][8]. The game was completed as scheduled without postponement or cancellation. \n\n**recommendation: p1**",
