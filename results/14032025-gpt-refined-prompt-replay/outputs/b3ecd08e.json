  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know whether Real Madrid or Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid will advance in the UCL Round of 16. The resolution depends on the outcome of their match. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The system says it's March 14, 2025, 7:27 PM UTC. The second leg was scheduled for March 12, 2025, so the match has already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially sources [4], [6], [8], [9], and [10], it's clear that the match went to a penalty shootout. Real Madrid won the shootout 4-2 after the aggregate score was tied 2-2. Atl\u00e9tico won the second leg 1-0, but Real advanced via penalties. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if Real Madrid advances, it's p2. Since the official result from UEFA (as per the sources) confirms Real's advancement, the answer should be p2. Also, the event has already occurred, so there's no need to consider future dates. No cancellation or postponement is mentioned, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nI need to make sure all citations are correct. The key sources confirming the penalty shootout and Real's victory are [4], [8], [9], and [10]. The final answer should cite these and end with the recommendation p2.\n</think>\n\nReal Madrid advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals after defeating Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 4-2 in a penalty shootout following a 1-0 loss in the second leg of their Round of 16 tie[4][8][9]. The aggregate score was tied 2-2 after Atl\u00e9tico's Conor Gallagher scored 27 seconds into the March 12, 2025 match[4][11], leading to extra time and penalties. Key moments included Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez's disallowed penalty due to a double-contact violation during the shootout[9][10], and Antonio R\u00fcdiger's decisive penalty conversion[4][8].  \n\nThis outcome maintains Real Madrid's historical dominance over Atl\u00e9tico in Champions League knockout stages, marking their seventh elimination of their rivals in European competition[3][4].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
