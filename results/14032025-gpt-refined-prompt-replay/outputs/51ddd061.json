  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the CSU Bakersfield vs. UC Santa Barbara game on March 12, 2025. The key here is to determine who won the game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I'll check the dates of the search results. The game was scheduled for March 12, 2025. The current date given is March 14, 2025, so the game should have already happened. Let's look through the sources.\n\nLooking at result [1], it mentions a game on March 14 where UC Santa Barbara won against CSUN, but that's a different game in the semifinals. The user's query is about the March 12 game. \n\nResult [5] from ESPN shows the final score as UC Santa Barbara 71-66. That's a direct confirmation. Result [7] from the UCSB official site also states they defeated CSU Bakersfield 71-66. Result [8] on The Score website lists the final score as 71-66 in favor of UCSB. Result [9] from Noozhawk details Stephan Swenson's performance in the 71-66 win. Result [11] from the CSU Bakersfield site's box score also confirms the 71-66 score with UCSB as the winner.\n\nAll these sources consistently report UCSB's victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, the market should resolve to UC Santa Barbara, which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nUC Santa Barbara defeated CSU Bakersfield 71-66 in their Big West Conference Tournament first-round game on March 12, 2025. The Gauchos maintained control throughout the contest, leading 32-25 at halftime and withstanding a second-half push from the Roadrunners. Key contributions came from guard Stephan Swenson (15 points, 6 rebounds, 4 steals) and forward Colin Smith (13 points), while UCSB's defense forced 12 turnovers[5][7][8][9]. This outcome aligns with pregame predictions favoring UCSB, who had won 11 straight against CSU Bakersfield[2][4]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation[5][7].\n\nrecommendation: p1",
