  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Wyoming vs. San Jose State basketball game. The key here is to determine if the event has already occurred and what the result was. \n\nFirst, I check the current date provided, which is March 14, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 12, 2025. Since today is the 14th, the game should have already taken place. \n\nLooking through the search results, multiple sources confirm the game's outcome. Sources [1], [4], [5], and [8] all mention that San Jose State defeated Wyoming with a score of 66-61 in the Mountain West Tournament on March 12. These are reliable sources like ESPN, the official San Jose State athletics website, and a local news outlet. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All the relevant search results agree on the result. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The detailed stats and post-game reports indicate the game was completed as scheduled. \n\nSince the event has occurred and San Jose State won, the resolution should be p1 according to the user's conditions. The ancillary data specifies that p1 corresponds to San Jose State winning. There's no reason to consider p3 or p4 here because the game was played, and the result is clear. \n\nTherefore, the final recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Wyoming Cowboys faced the San Jos\u00e9 State Spartans in the Mountain West Conference Tournament on March 12, 2025. The game concluded with **San Jos\u00e9 State defeating Wyoming 66-61**, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][4][5][8]. Key details include:\n\n- **San Jos\u00e9 State** built a 22-point first-half lead and held off Wyoming's second-half comeback attempt, advancing to the quarterfinals against New Mexico[1][4].\n- **Donavan Yap** led the Spartans with 19 points, including four three-pointers, while **Sadaidriene Hall** added 16 points[4][5].\n- Wyoming\u2019s **Jordan Nesbitt** scored 16 points, but the Cowboys shot just 10.5% (2-of-19) from three-point range[1][8].\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled on March 12, 2025, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Based on the verified outcome, the market resolves to **San Jos\u00e9 State**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
