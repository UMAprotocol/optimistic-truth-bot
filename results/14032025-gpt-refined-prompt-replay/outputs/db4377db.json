  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Vancouver Canucks vs. Calgary Flames game scheduled for March 12 at 9:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Flames, p2 for Canucks, and p3 if canceled or postponed.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, so the game date (March 12) has already passed. Looking through the search results:\n\nSearch result [1] from March 13 mentions a Canucks vs. Flames game where Vancouver won in a shootout (4-3). Similarly, [4] and [7] also describe this game on March 12 with details about Elias Pettersson scoring in overtime and Conor Garland getting the shootout winner. These sources confirm that the game took place as planned and resulted in a Canucks victory.\n\nSince all relevant sources indicate that Vancouver won on March 12, there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions (p2 for Canucks), the correct answer should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks defeated the Calgary Flames 4-3 in a shootout during their NHL game on **March 12, 2025**[1][4][7]. Key moments included Elias Pettersson tying the score late in regulation and Conor Garland securing the shootout winner[7]. This result tied both teams at **71 points** in standings[1][4], but since Vancouver emerged victorious under standard NHL rules governing regular-season games decided by shootouts[7], it constitutes an official win for them.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
