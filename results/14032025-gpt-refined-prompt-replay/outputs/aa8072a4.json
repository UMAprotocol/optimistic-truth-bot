Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nNote: reaching the Play-In Tournament will not qualify as making the Playoffs. To make the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs, a team must earn one of the 16 spots in the postseason bracket.\n\nIf at any point it becomes impossible for this team to make the Playoffs based on the rules of the NBA (e.g. they are mathematically eliminated from reaching the Play-In), this market will resolve immediately to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from the NBA.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the Oklahoma City Thunder will make the 2025 NBA Playoffs. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. But according to the personalization rules, I need to check if the event has already happened based on verified facts.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources indicating the Thunder have already clinched a playoff spot. For example, result [3] from March 12, 2025, states the Thunder clinched a berth with a win over the Celtics. Result [4] confirms they became the first Western Conference team to secure a playoff spot. Additionally, result [11] mentions the Thunder officially clinched their spot. \n\nThe key here is whether making the playoffs is confirmed. The NBA's structure requires teams to be in the top 6 to avoid the play-in. The Thunder's record of 54-12 (from [3] and [8]) and their position as the first seed in the West (as per [6] and [10]) mean they've secured a top-six spot. The note in the query specifies that play-in doesn't count, but the Thunder are already in the playoffs directly. \n\nSince the current date in the prompt is March 14, 2025, and the Thunder clinched on March 12, this is a past event. All sources agree they've qualified. Therefore, the answer should resolve to Yes (p2). No future uncertainty here; it's already happened.\n</think>\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder have already secured a spot in the 2025 NBA Playoffs. They clinched their postseason berth on **March 12, 2025**, with a 118-112 victory over the Boston Celtics, improving their record to 54-12 and maintaining their position as the Western Conference\u2019s top seed[3][4][8][11]. This marks their 12th playoff appearance since relocating to Oklahoma City in 2008 and their second consecutive No. 1 seed in the West[4][6]. \n\nThe Thunder\u2019s dominant regular-season performance, led by MVP frontrunner Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (averaging 32.7 points per game), ensured an automatic playoff qualification without needing the Play-In Tournament[3][6][12]. Official NBA standings confirm their clinched position[7][8], and their remaining schedule focuses on securing home-court advantage for the Finals[9]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
