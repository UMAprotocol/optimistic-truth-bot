  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how the market will resolve based on the outcome of the Sabres vs. Red Wings game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Red Wings win, p2 for Sabres, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after March 12. So the game should have already taken place. Let me look through the search results to confirm the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([1], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9]) mention the game on March 12, 2025. Specifically, result [1] states that the Red Wings won 7-3. Other sources like [4] and [8] also confirm the Red Wings' victory with Patrick Kane's 5-point performance. The box score in [7] shows the final score as 7-3 in favor of Detroit. \n\nSince the game was played and the Red Wings won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the results. All sources indicate the game occurred as planned. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Red Wings defeated the Buffalo Sabres 7-3 in their NHL game on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources detailing the final score, key player performances, and game highlights[1][4][7][8]. Patrick Kane led the Red Wings with two goals and three assists, while Marco Kasper and Alex DeBrincat contributed multi-point efforts. The game included three fights and 68 penalty minutes in the third period but concluded without postponement or cancellation[1][5][9].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
