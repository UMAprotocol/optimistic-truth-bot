  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the Coppin State vs. SC State basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for SC State winning, p2 for Coppin State, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, so the game date (March 12) has already passed. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [1] from CBS Sports details the game result where SC State won 68-63. Other sources like [2], [3], [8], and [11] also report the same outcome. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game occurring on March 12, with detailed stats and post-game analyses. There's no indication of any cancellation or postponement. \n\nSince the game was played and SC State won, the resolution should be p1. The user's current time is March 14, 2025, which is after the game date, so there's no issue with future events here. All evidence points to a completed game with a clear winner. Therefore, the market should resolve to SC State, which is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe March 12, 2025 MEAC Tournament quarterfinal basketball game between Coppin State and South Carolina State occurred as scheduled, with South Carolina State defeating Coppin State 68-63[1][2][3][8][11]. Multiple sources confirm the game was played to completion with no indication of postponement or cancellation.  \n\nKey details:  \n- Final score: South Carolina State 68, Coppin State 63[1][4]  \n- Game timeline: Coppin State led 41-37 at halftime before SC State rallied with an 11-0 second-half run[2][8]  \n- Statistical verification: Box scores show SC State's Wilson Dubinsky led all scorers with 20 points[4][11]  \n- Tournament progression: SC State advanced to the MEAC semifinals[2][3]  \n\nThis outcome meets the market's resolution criteria for an SC State victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
