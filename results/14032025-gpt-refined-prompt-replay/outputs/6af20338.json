  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Tax\" five or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"Tax\" (including plural/possessive forms) during that specific event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for mentions of Trump's statements during the press conference. The key sources here are [1], [4], [6], [7], [8], [14], [17], and [18], as they directly report on the March 12 event. \n\nLooking at [1], Trump accuses Ireland of stealing US pharmaceutical companies' tax revenue. The article quotes him mentioning \"tax revenue\" and \"tax policies.\" That's at least two instances. \n\nIn [4], Trump is asked if he'll lower US taxes to match Ireland's and responds, \u201cplanning to lower taxes if the Democrats behave.\u201d Here, \"taxes\" is used once. \n\nSource [6] quotes Trump saying Ireland used \"tax policy\" to lure companies, and he mentions \"tax policies\" and \"tax breaks.\" That's two more mentions. \n\nFrom [7], Trump states Ireland's tax policies attracted US companies, using \"tax policies\" again. Another mention. \n\nIn [8], Trump discusses Ireland's \"tax system\" and \"corporate tax rate,\" adding two more instances. \n\nSource [17] includes a transcript where Trump talks about lowering taxes, saying \"taxes\" once. \n\n[18] mentions Trump criticizing Ireland's low tax rates, using \"tax rates\" once. \n\nAdding these up: \"tax revenue,\" \"tax policies\" (twice), \"taxes\" (twice), \"tax system,\" \"corporate tax rate,\" \"tax breaks,\" and \"tax rates.\" That's at least eight instances of the word \"tax\" in its various forms. \n\nSince all these mentions are from the press conference on March 12, the count exceeds five. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nDuring the March 12, 2025, St. Patrick\u2019s Day press conference with Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin, Donald Trump used variations of the term \u201ctax\u201d **at least eight times**, focusing on Ireland\u2019s corporate tax policies and their impact on U.S. companies[1][4][6][7][8][17][18]. Key instances include:\n\n- Accusing Ireland of using **\u201ctax policies\u201d** to lure U.S. pharmaceutical companies[1][6][8].\n- Criticizing the EU\u2019s **\u201ctax system\u201d** and Ireland\u2019s **\u201ccorporate tax rate\u201d**[8][18].\n- Stating he would **\u201clower taxes\u201d** in the U.S. if Democrats cooperate[4][17].\n- Referencing **\u201ctax revenue\u201d** losses and **\u201ctax breaks\u201d** for multinational corporations[1][6].\n\nThe term \u201ctax\u201d appeared in plural, possessive, and compound forms (e.g., \u201ctaxes,\u201d \u201ctax policies\u201d), all of which count toward resolution under the market\u2019s rules. No ambiguity exists in the verified transcripts and reports from the event.  \n\n**recommendation: p2**",
