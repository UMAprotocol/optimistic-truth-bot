  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Texas vs. Vanderbilt CBB game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is two days after the scheduled game date. So the game should have taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [4] from the University of Texas Athletics website states that Texas defeated Vanderbilt 79-72 in the SEC Tournament First Round on March 12. The article provides a detailed account of the game, including key players and moments, confirming the result. \n\nSource [6] is a PDF from Vanderbilt's official site, which includes the official box score showing Texas with 79 points and Vanderbilt with 72 points. This corroborates the result from source [4]. \n\nAdditionally, source [5] mentions a previous game where Vanderbilt beat Texas on February 8, 2025, but that's a different game. The query is about the March 12 game, which Texas won according to the more recent sources. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the provided sources. Both sources [4] and [6] confirm the game occurred as scheduled with a clear result. Therefore, the market should resolve to Texas, which corresponds to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Texas Longhorns defeated the Vanderbilt Commodores 79-72 in their SEC Tournament First Round game on March 12, 2025, at Bridgestone Arena[4][6]. The official box score shows Texas leading 41-26 at halftime and maintaining their advantage despite Vanderbilt's second-half rally[6]. Freshman guard Tre Johnson and graduate guard Tramon Mark each scored 19 points for Texas[4].\n\nThis result occurred on the scheduled date (March 12) with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1][4][6]. The market should resolve to Texas as the winner.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
