  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. First, I need to determine the current date and time to check if the event in question has already occurred. The user provided the current date as Friday, March 14, 2025, 6:39:59 PM UTC. The game in question is scheduled for March 12 at 7:30 PM ET. \n\nWait, March 12 is two days before March 14. So the game should have already taken place. But I need to confirm the time zones. ET is UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving. Let's convert the game time to UTC. If the game was on March 12 at 7:30 PM ET, that would be March 13 at 12:30 AM UTC (since ET is UTC-5 in March). The current time given is March 14, 6:39 PM UTC, which is well after the game's scheduled time. \n\nNext, I need to check the outcome of the game. The ancillary data mentions that if the Thunder win, it resolves to p2, Celtics to p1, and so on. Since the game has already occurred, I should look for the result. However, the provided search results don't include any information about the game's outcome. There's no data indicating whether the Thunder or Celtics won, if it was postponed, or canceled. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, without verified information, I can't assume the result. The instructions state that if the event hasn't occurred or there's no data, it should resolve to p4. But wait, the event date has passed. However, without any sources confirming the outcome, I can't definitively say who won. The user's personalization rules require relying solely on verified facts. Since there's no data here, maybe it's a case where the information isn't available yet, even though the date has passed. But the system should have access to the latest info. Since the search results are empty, perhaps the game was postponed or the result isn't recorded here. \n\nIn the absence of any information, the safe resolution would be p3 (unknown/50-50) if the game was canceled, but without confirmation, I can't assume that. However, the user's instructions say that if the event is in the future, return p4. Since the event is in the past but there's no data, maybe it's considered unresolved. But the user's rules state that if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, return p4. Since the event's date has passed, but there's no result, perhaps it's still pending resolution. However, the user's guidelines don't cover this scenario explicitly. \n\nWait, the resolution conditions mention that if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If it's canceled, resolves to p3. But without knowing the status, and given that the current time is after the scheduled time, but no info is available, the correct approach is to check if the game happened. Since there's no data here, perhaps the answer should be p4 because the information isn't available yet, even though the date has passed. Alternatively, if the system is supposed to know the result by now but doesn't, maybe it's p3. But according to the user's rules, p4 is for future events or unresolved due to lack of info. Since the event is past but no info, maybe p4 is still correct. However, the user's example says that if the event is in the future, even the same day but later time, use p4. But here, the event is in the past. The instructions aren't clear on this. \n\nGiven the strict rules, if the event's scheduled time has passed but there's no verification, perhaps it's considered unresolved and defaults to p4. Alternatively, if the system is expected to have the data, but it's missing, maybe p3. However, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event hasn't occurred yet. Since the event has occurred, but the result isn't known, maybe p3 (unknown). But the resolution conditions say p3 is for canceled games. Without knowing if it's canceled, perhaps p4 is still appropriate. This is a bit ambiguous, but based on the strictest interpretation, since the event's time has passed but there's no data, and the system can't verify the outcome, the recommendation would be p4.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Boston Celtics was scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. As of the current date and time (March 14, 2025, 6:39:59 PM UTC), the outcome of this game cannot be verified through the provided data. No sources confirm whether the game occurred as planned, was postponed, or canceled. According to the resolution rules, markets resolve to p4 when future events lack conclusive verification or when unresolved due to insufficient information. Since the event\u2019s status remains unconfirmed despite its scheduled date having passed, the recommendation adheres to unresolved criteria.\n\nrecommendation: p4",
