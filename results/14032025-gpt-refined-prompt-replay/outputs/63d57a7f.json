  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how to resolve a market based on the outcome of the USC vs. Rutgers game from March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Rutgers, p2 for USC, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 12, 2025. Sources [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], and [7] all confirm that USC won the game in double overtime with a score of 97-89. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nLooking at the details, the game went into double overtime, which means it was completed. All sources report the final result, so there's no ambiguity. Since USC won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. \n\nI also need to check the current date provided, which is March 14, 2025. The game was played on March 12, so it's in the past. No future considerations here. All sources agree on the outcome, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe USC Trojans defeated the Rutgers Scarlet Knights 97-89 in double overtime during the first round of the 2025 Big Ten Tournament on March 12, 2025[1][2][4][5][6]. The game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Key details include:\n\n- **Game Outcome**: USC (14th seed) secured the victory after overcoming Rutgers' late-game surge, with Desmond Claude leading all scorers with 28 points[1][6]. The Trojans advanced to face Purdue in the next round[1][6].\n- **Overtime Drama**: The game required two overtime periods, with USC pulling away in the second OT behind critical plays from Claude, Rashaun Agee (23 points, 11 rebounds), and Wesley Yates III (24 points)[1][4][6].\n- **No Postponement/Cancellation**: All sources confirm the game concluded on March 12 without interruption[1][2][4][5][6][7].\n\nSince the game was completed and USC won, the market resolves to **USC**.  \nrecommendation: p2",
