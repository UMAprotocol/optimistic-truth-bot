  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Butler vs. Providence game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Providence, p2 for Butler, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after March 12. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the game took place. For example, result [1] from Butler's sports site mentions a 75-69 win by Butler on March 12. Similarly, result [6] from CBS Sports confirms the final score and that Butler advanced. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome. Both sources [1] and [6] state that Butler won 75-69. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The detailed stats in [1] and [9] also back up the result, with Pierre Brooks scoring 25 points for Butler. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and Butler won, the market should resolve to p2. The user's current date is after the game date, so there's no issue with it being a future event. All sources agree on the result, so there's no ambiguity. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nButler defeated Providence 75-69 in the March 12, 2025, BIG EAST Tournament first-round game at Madison Square Garden. Pierre Brooks II led the Bulldogs with 25 points and seven rebounds, while Jahmyl Telfort added 16 points[1][6]. The game was played as scheduled, with Butler never trailing and maintaining a lead as large as 14 points in the second half[1][4]. Providence\u2019s Bensley Joseph scored 20 points, but the Friars shot just 38% from the field and 8/35 from three-point range[1][6]. The outcome meets the market\u2019s resolution criteria for a Butler victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
