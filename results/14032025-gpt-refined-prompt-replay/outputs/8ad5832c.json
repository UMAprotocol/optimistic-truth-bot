  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know the resolution of a market based on the outcome of the Cal Poly vs. UC Davis basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET. The market resolves to Cal Poly if they win, UC Davis if they win, or 50-50 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current date provided is Friday, March 14, 2025, 6:54:51 PM UTC. The game was supposed to happen on March 12, which is two days prior. So the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Source [2] mentions Cal Poly's victory over UC Davis with a score of 86-76. Source [4] and [5] also report the same outcome, with Cal Poly winning after a strong second half. The box score in source [6] and [8] further corroborate the final score. \n\nSince the game was played and Cal Poly won, the market should resolve to Cal Poly, which corresponds to p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here. All sources agree on the result, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Cal Poly Mustangs defeated the UC Davis Aggies 86-76 in the Big West Tournament opening-round game played on March 12, 2025[2][4][6]. Despite trailing by nine points at halftime, Cal Poly staged a second-half comeback, outscoring UC Davis 48-29 after the break[4][6]. Key contributors included Owen Koonce (18 points), Isaac Jessup (17 points), and Jarred Hyder (16 points)[6][8]. UC Davis' Pablo Tamba led all scorers with 25 points[6].\n\nThe game concluded as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources. Since Cal Poly won decisively, the market resolution should reflect their victory.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
