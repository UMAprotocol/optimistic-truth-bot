  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Anaheim Ducks vs. Utah Hockey Club game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Utah, p2 for Ducks, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is two days after the game date. So the event should have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources reporting on the game. The NHL.com recap [2] states that Utah defeated the Ducks 3-2. Other sources like CBS Sports [6], ESPN [8], and The Hockey Writers [4] all confirm the same score and outcome. The game took place on March 12, and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nThe user's ancillary data mentions that if Utah wins, the market resolves to p1. Since all sources confirm Utah's victory, the correct resolution should be p1. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All reports are consistent, and the game wasn't postponed or canceled. Therefore, the market should resolve to Utah (p1).\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Anaheim Ducks and Utah Hockey Club scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET concluded with a **3-2 victory for Utah**. Multiple sources confirm the outcome, including detailed recaps from NHL.com[2][3], ESPN[8], and CBS Sports[6], which highlight Dylan Guenther\u2019s game-winning power-play goal in the third period. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by the finalized scores and post-game statistics[5][12]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
