  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Jew\" or \"Jewish\" three or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of those terms in the specified event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Trump using those words during the event. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles about the press conference. \n\nLooking at source [14], which is the transcript of Trump hosting Miche\u00e1l Martin, I'll scan through the dialogue. In the transcript, Trump mentions \"Irish\" several times but doesn't use \"Jew\" or \"Jewish.\" He talks about business relationships, fighters, and other topics but not those specific terms.\n\nSource [1] mentions the canceled meeting with Jewish leaders and Trump's comments on antisemitism, but this is a separate meeting, not the press conference. Source [2], [5], [6], and [17] discuss Trump calling Schumer a Palestinian and saying he's not Jewish anymore, but these comments were made during the Oval Office meeting, not the press conference. \n\nSource [15] talks about Trump's blunder at the St. Patrick's Day event, but again, no mention of \"Jew\" or \"Jewish\" in that context. The press conference transcript in [14] doesn't include those terms. \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that only the press conference with Q&A counts. Other meetings or statements from the same day but different events don't apply. Since the transcript of the actual press conference doesn't show Trump using the words, the answer should be \"No.\" However, I need to confirm if any other sources mention the press conference specifically. \n\nSources [8] and [18] are videos of the meetings, but without transcripts, I rely on the provided text. None of the search results indicate Trump used \"Jew\" or \"Jewish\" during the press conference. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided search results, there is no evidence that Donald Trump used the terms \"Jew\" or \"Jewish\" three or more times during his March 12, 2025 press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. The key findings:\n\n1. **Transcript analysis** of the Oval Office meeting shows Trump discussed Irish-American relations, tax policies, and made remarks about Chuck Schumer[14][17], but did not use the specified terms in that context.\n\n2. **Controversial comments** about Senator Schumer being \"not Jewish anymore\" and calling him a \"Palestinian\" occurred during the bilateral meeting[2][5][6][17], but these statements:\n   - Did not include the word \"Jewish\" \n   - Were made in a different setting than the press conference\n\n3. **Press coverage** of the St. Patrick's Day events focused on:\n   - The canceled meeting with Jewish leaders[1][4]\n   - Trump's reading gaffes[15]\n   - Policy discussions about Israel/Palestine[16]\n   But did not report any instances of Trump using \"Jew\" or \"Jewish\" during the press conference itself.\n\n4. **Resolution parameters** specify that only the press conference/Q&A portion counts, excluding preceding bilateral meetings[1][14]. The inflammatory Schumer remarks occurred in the Oval Office meeting before the press event[14][17].\n\nWhile Trump made several Israel-related comments and engaged with Jewish issues peripherally, the search results contain no evidence of him uttering \"Jew\" or \"Jewish\" during the designated press conference. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
