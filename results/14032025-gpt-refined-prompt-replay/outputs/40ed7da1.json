Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nNote: If Gruden accepts a position on an NFL team that is not \"Head Coach\", this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is official information from the NFL, any signing NFL team, and/or Jon Gruden and his official representative(s), however a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Jon Gruden will be announced as an NFL head coach for the 2025-26 season by March 12, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on official announcements or credible reports confirming his hiring. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system mentions it's March 14, 2025, which is after the deadline of March 12. That's crucial because any announcements after the 12th wouldn't count. But the search results provided are up to March 13, 2025, so I need to see if there's any mention of Gruden being hired before the deadline.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 17) from January 2025 indicate that Gruden is a hot candidate, with teams like the Jets, Saints, Bears, and possibly the Raiders considering him. However, these are all reports of interest and due diligence, not official hires. \n\nResult 4 is a YouTube video transcript from December 31, 2024, discussing teams doing homework on Gruden but again no confirmation. Results 13 and 14 from March 1 and February 27, 2025, mention the Cowboys' owner not denying interest and the Buccaneers reinstating Gruden to their Ring of Honor, but neither confirms a head coach position. \n\nResult 15 from February 14, 2025, states Gruden is headlining a coaching clinic in March 2025, which is a speaking engagement, not a coaching role. Result 16 and 18 from March 2024 mention his advisory role with a European team, which isn't an NFL head coach position.\n\nCrucially, none of the search results mention an official announcement or credible report confirming Gruden's hiring as a head coach by March 12. All the information points to speculation and interest but no concrete hiring. Since the deadline has passed and there's no evidence of a hire before March 12, the answer should resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nJon Gruden has been a prominent figure in recent NFL head coaching rumors for the 2025-26 season, with multiple reports indicating interest from teams like the **New York Jets**, **New Orleans Saints**, **Chicago Bears**, and potentially the **Las Vegas Raiders** [1][2][5][6][8][11][17]. However, as of the resolution deadline (**March 12, 2025, 4:00 PM ET**), there is no official confirmation or credible reporting that Gruden has been hired as an NFL head coach.  \n\nKey points from the search results:  \n- **Interest from Teams**: NFL insiders, including Tom Pelissero, noted that multiple teams conducted \"extensive homework\" on Gruden\u2019s coaching history and personal conduct [2][6][17]. The Saints reportedly considered him for their offensive coordinator role in 2024, but he declined [3].  \n- **Controversy and Legal Issues**: Gruden\u2019s 2021 resignation from the Raiders due to offensive emails and his ongoing lawsuit against the NFL were noted as potential obstacles, but sources suggested these factors would not deter teams from considering him [1][5][8].  \n- **Recent Activities**: Gruden has remained active in football through advisory roles (e.g., with the European League of Football\u2019s Milano Seamen in 2024) and public appearances, including a Tennessee coaching clinic in March 2025 [15][16][18].  \n\nNo announcements or credible reports confirming a head coaching hire were identified within the resolution window. While speculation about his candidacy was widespread, the lack of a formal agreement by the deadline necessitates resolution to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
