  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Seton Hall vs. Villanova game. First, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date provided is March 14, 2025, and the game was scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. Since March 12 is two days before the current date, the game should have already taken place.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome of the game. The ancillary data mentions that if Seton Hall wins, the market resolves to \"Seton Hall\" (p2), and if Villanova wins, it's \"Villanova\" (p1). If the game was postponed or canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nI should look for sources that confirm the game's result. The search results include a link to ESPN's game summary. Checking that, it shows Seton Hall won 66-56. This is a reliable source, so the result is confirmed. Since the game wasn't postponed or canceled, the resolution should be p2. \n\nFinally, ensure the response follows the required format, ending with the recommendation. The last line must be \"recommendation: p2\".\n</think>\n\nThe Seton Hall vs. Villanova men's college basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025 at 9:00 PM ET was completed as planned. According to the official ESPN game summary, Seton Hall defeated Villanova with a final score of 66-56[1]. As the game concluded without postponement or cancellation, the market resolves based on the outcome where Seton Hall emerged victorious. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
