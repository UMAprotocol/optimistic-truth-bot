  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how a specific UMA market would resolve based on the outcome of the New York Islanders vs. Los Angeles Kings game scheduled for March 11, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Kings winning, p2 for Islanders, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after March 11. So the game should have already happened. Let me look through the search results to confirm the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [1][4][6][8] report that the Kings won the game 4-1. For example, the CBS Sports article [1] states, \"Danault, Byfield score in 2nd period as Kings beat Islanders 4-1.\" Similarly, the LA Times article [6] and ESPN's recap [8] confirm the same score. \n\nThere's also mention of the Kings' penalty kill performance and the Islanders having two goals disallowed, which supports that the game was played and concluded. Additionally, sources like the LA Kings Insider [4] provide a detailed game recap, including quotes from players and the coach, which wouldn't make sense if the game was postponed or canceled.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed. Search result [5] talks about a Kings game postponed in January 2025 due to wildfires, but that's a different date. The other postponement mentioned in [2] is from 2021, which is irrelevant here. All other sources from March 11-12, 2025, discuss the game as having occurred with a Kings victory. \n\nSince the game was played and the Kings won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no indication of cancellation or postponement for this specific game. The user's current date is March 14, so the game is in the past, and the result is confirmed. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the New York Islanders and Los Angeles Kings on March 11, 2025, concluded with a **4-1 victory for the Kings** at Crypto.com Arena. Key moments included goals by Phillip Danault and Quinton Byfield in the second period, along with a strong penalty-killing performance by Los Angeles (8-for-8 on the PK) and two disallowed goals for the Islanders due to goaltender interference[1][4][6][8]. The game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the provided sources.  \n\n**Recommendation:** p1",
