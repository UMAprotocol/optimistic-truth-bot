  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the UT Arlington vs. Grand Canyon basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Grand Canyon winning, p2 for UT Arlington, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, so the game should have already taken place. Let me look through the search results to confirm the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources report the game occurred. For example, source [1] states that Grand Canyon won 98-75 in the WAC Quarterfinals on March 12. Source [5] from CBS Sports also confirms the same score, with JaKobe Coles leading Grand Canyon. Additionally, source [10] mentions GCU's 98-75 victory, advancing them to the semifinals. \n\nAll the sources from both universities' athletic sites and sports news outlets agree on the result. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The box scores in sources [4] and [6] provide detailed stats, further confirming the game was played. \n\nSince the game was played and Grand Canyon won decisively, the correct resolution is p1. The user's current date is after the game date, so there's no issue with it being a future event. No sources indicate any cancellations or postponements. Therefore, the market should resolve to Grand Canyon (p1).\n</think>\n\nThe game between UT Arlington and Grand Canyon took place as scheduled on March 12, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET. Grand Canyon defeated UT Arlington with a final score of **98-75** in the WAC Tournament quarterfinals[1][5][10]. The outcome was confirmed by multiple sources, including official university recaps and sports news outlets. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game is required.\n\n**Resolution:** The market resolves to **Grand Canyon** (p1).  \nrecommendation: p1",
