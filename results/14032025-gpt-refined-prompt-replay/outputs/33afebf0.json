  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how the market should resolve based on the outcome of the Suns vs. Rockets game on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Rockets, p2 for Suns, and p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 12, 2025. Sources [2], [6], and [8] all discuss the game details and the outcome. \n\nLooking at the results, the Rockets won 111-104 according to source [2] and [6]. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so there's no need for p3. The final score clearly shows the Rockets as the winners. \n\nI should verify the date and time. The game was scheduled for March 12 at 8 PM ET. The current date given is March 14, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event has occurred. \n\nNo sources mention any postponement or cancellation. All evidence points to the game being completed with the Rockets winning. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Houston Rockets defeated the Phoenix Suns 111-104 in their March 12, 2025 matchup at Toyota Center[2][6]. Jalen Green led the Rockets with 29 points and 7 rebounds, while Bradley Beal scored a team-high 25 points for Phoenix[2][6]. The game featured an altercation resulting in ejections of Steven Adams and Mason Plumlee during the second quarter[2][6], but was completed without cancellation or postponement.\n\n**Key game details**:\n- Final score: Rockets 111, Suns 104[2][6]\n- Rockets led by 9 points entering the 4th quarter[6]\n- Phoenix starters were benched with 5 minutes remaining[6]\n- Houston maintained control through strong performances from Alperen Sengun (20 points) and Dillon Brooks[2][6]\n\nAs the game concluded with a Rockets victory and met all completion criteria, the market resolves to **p1** based on the ancillary data parameters.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
