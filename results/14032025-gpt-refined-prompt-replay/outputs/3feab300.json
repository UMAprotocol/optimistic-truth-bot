  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Saudi Arabia\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key here is to look through all the sources to see if any mention Trump saying \"Saudi Arabia\" during that specific event. The press conference in question is the one with Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Irish PM, on March 12. \n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. Sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [13], [15] all discuss the meeting between Trump and Martin. They mention trade issues, tariffs, and other topics like the EU and pharmaceuticals. None of these sources mention Trump discussing Saudi Arabia during this event.\n\n2. Sources [5], [9], [10], [11], [12], [14] relate to Saudi Arabia in other contexts, such as Ukraine peace talks or Gaza plans, but these are separate events. For example, source [5] talks about a meeting in Saudi Arabia regarding Ukraine, but that's a different event. Similarly, source [11] discusses Saudi Arabia's role in foreign policy but not during the March 12 press conference.\n\n3. The user specified that only the scheduled press conference with Martin counts. Preceding meetings or other events don't qualify. The resolution source is the video of the press conference. \n\n4. The updates mention the resolution is based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. The search results from the press conference (like [4], [8], [15]) don't indicate any mention of Saudi Arabia. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, there's no evidence Trump mentioned \"Saudi Arabia\" during the press conference with the Irish PM. The answer should resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not mention \"Saudi Arabia\" during his March 12, 2025, press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. The event focused on U.S.-Ireland trade relations, Trump\u2019s criticism of the EU and Ireland\u2019s corporate tax policies, and discussions about tariffs[1][2][3][4][6][7][8][13][15]. While Saudi Arabia was referenced in other contexts during Trump\u2019s presidency (e.g., Ukraine-Gaza diplomacy[5][9][11][12]), these mentions occurred in separate engagements unrelated to the St. Patrick\u2019s Day press conference. The resolution criteria explicitly exclude preceding bilateral meetings and limit the scope to the scheduled presser.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
