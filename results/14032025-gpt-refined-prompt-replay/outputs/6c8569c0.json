  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Iowa vs. Ohio State CBB game scheduled for March 12 at 6:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Ohio State, p2 for Iowa, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 14, 2025, so the game date (March 12) has already passed. Now, looking at the search results, sources [1] and [4] both report on the game. \n\nIn [1], the title clearly states Ohio State fell to Iowa 77-70 on March 12. The detailed stats and game recap confirm the result. Source [4] also mentions Iowa's victory over Ohio State in the Big Ten Tournament, specifically noting the 77-70 score and key moments like Brock Harding's clutch three-pointer. \n\nSince the game took place and Iowa won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. Both results are from reputable sports sites, so the information is reliable. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other search results like [6] and [7] discuss unrelated Iowa news, so they can be ignored. The key sources [1] and [4] both confirm Iowa's win. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Iowa Hawkeyes defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes 77-70 in their March 12, 2025, Big Ten Tournament game, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][4]. The game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Iowa's victory was secured by key plays, including Brock Harding's decisive three-pointer in the final seconds[4].  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- **Final Score:** Iowa 77, Ohio State 70[1][4]  \n- **Game Flow:** The contest featured 13 lead changes and 10 ties before Iowa pulled ahead late[4].  \n- **Clutch Moment:** Harding\u2019s three-pointer with 15 seconds left extended Iowa\u2019s lead to 75-70, effectively sealing the outcome[1].  \n\nSince the game concluded without cancellation or postponement, the market resolves to Iowa\u2019s victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
