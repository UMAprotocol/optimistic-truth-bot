  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"God\" at least twice during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on the specific event mentioned, which is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Trump using the word \"God\" during that event. Looking through the sources, there are a few key points. \n\nIn source [14], the transcript of the press conference includes Trump talking about the history of St. Patrick's Church. He mentions that the parishioners had \"faith in God\" and repeats the phrase \"God will never do this to us.\" That's two instances right there. \n\nSource [9] and [13] also reference Trump's remarks about the church incident, where he mentions God twice. Additionally, source [20] provides a transcript of the reception where Trump discusses the same story, again using \"God\" twice. \n\nThe user specified that the press conference in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception. The transcripts from this event clearly show Trump using \"God\" two times. Even though other events like the bilateral meeting or luncheon are mentioned in other sources, the resolution is focused on the 5 PM reception. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided transcripts, Trump did say \"God\" twice during the specified event. The answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did use the term \"God\" twice during the March 12, 2025 St. Patrick's Day reception with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. In his remarks about the historical defense of St. Patrick's Church during the War of 1812, Trump stated:\n\n1. **\"The other thing they had was faith in God\"**  \n2. **\"They said, God will never do this to us\"**  \n\nThese two explicit references occurred during the ceremonial event where Trump recounted the story of Irish-American parishioners defending their church[14][20]. The resolution criteria specify that pluralization/possessive forms count, and compound words don't affect validity. The event in question (5 PM ET reception) was confirmed as the resolution source[19], and the transcripts show both required instances.\n\nrecommendation: p2",
