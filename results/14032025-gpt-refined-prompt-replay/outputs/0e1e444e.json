  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"Zelenskyy\" during his press conference with Ireland's PM Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. Wait, but hold on. The press conference in question is actually between Donald Trump and Miche\u00e1l Martin, not Zelenskyy. The query might have a typo or confusion here. The market is about whether Trump will say \"Zelenskyy\" during his appearance with Martin.\n\nFirst, I need to check the event details. The press conference is part of the St. Patrick's Day Reception scheduled for 5 PM ET on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether Trump utters the term \"Zelenskyy\" during that specific event. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several mentions of Trump's meeting with Martin. The key sources are [2], [3], [12], [14], and [15]. These describe the interactions between Trump and Martin, including discussions about Ukraine. For example, in [2] and [3], Trump's meeting with Martin is noted as his first since the contentious meeting with Zelenskyy. However, the transcripts from the St. Patrick's Day Reception in [15] don't mention Trump saying \"Zelenskyy.\" The focus was on Ireland-U.S. relations and peace efforts, but Zelenskyy's name wasn't brought up by Trump during the reception speech.\n\nAdditionally, sources [8] and [14] mention that Martin discussed Ukraine during the visit, but there's no indication Trump used Zelenskyy's name during the press conference. The main topics were trade, Ireland's contributions, and St. Patrick's Day celebrations. \n\nSince the resolution source is the video of the press conference, and the provided transcripts from the event don't include any mention of \"Zelenskyy\" by Trump, it's likely the answer is \"No.\" The market resolves to p1 (No) if the term isn't used. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks whether Donald Trump will say \"Zelenskyy\" during his March 12, 2025, St. Patrick\u2019s Day press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. Analysis of the event\u2019s transcript and related coverage shows no instance of Trump using the term \"Zelenskyy\" during the reception or press conference. Discussions focused on U.S.-Ireland relations, trade, and broader peace efforts, but Trump did not reference the Ukrainian president by name in this specific context[2][3][12][14][15].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
