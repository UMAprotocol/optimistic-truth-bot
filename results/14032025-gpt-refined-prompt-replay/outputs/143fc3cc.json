  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Kevin O'Connell will be traded by March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's March 14, 2025, which is after the March 12 deadline. So any events after that date are irrelevant. Wait, but the search results go up to February 2025. Let me check the latest info.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a key source [14] from January 22, 2025, stating that the Vikings and O'Connell agreed to a multi-year extension. That's crucial. If they signed an extension, he's no longer in the final year of his contract, making a trade unlikely. Also, source [15] mentions the extension was finalized, ending any possibility of him being a free agent. \n\nOther sources like [4] and [12] mention O'Connell wanting to stay, and the Vikings not entertaining trade offers. The team sources in [1], [3], [6], and [9] all indicate the Vikings' intention to keep him. Even though there were rumors of teams interested (sources [1], [5], [7], [8], [9]), the Vikings' stance was clear. \n\nSince the extension was signed before March 12, the deadline has passed, and the answer should be No. The resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nKevin O'Connell will not be traded, as the Minnesota Vikings signed him to a multi-year contract extension on January 21, 2025, effectively ending speculation about his departure[14][15]. Despite earlier reports of multiple teams exploring trade possibilities due to his expiring contract[1][3][5][9], the Vikings consistently maintained they had no interest in trading him[1][4][6][12]. O'Connell publicly expressed his desire to remain in Minnesota[2][4][12], and ownership moved decisively to secure his future with the team before the March 12 deadline[14][15]. This extension negated any possibility of O'Connell entering the 2025 season as a coaching free agent or being traded[14][15].\n\nrecommendation: p1",
