  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Davidson vs. Richmond game on March 12, 2025. The key here is to determine if the event has already occurred and what the result was.\n\nFirst, I check the current date provided, which is March 14, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 12, so it should have already taken place. Now, I need to look through the search results to find evidence of the game's outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources report the outcome. Source [8] from NBC Sports mentions that Davidson defeated Richmond 69-65 in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament. Similarly, source [10] from Davidson's official website confirms the same score, with Reed Bailey scoring 25 points. The AP news article in source [11] and CBS Sports in [12] also report Davidson's victory with the same score. \n\nThese multiple credible sources all agree that Davidson won the game. Since the event has occurred and the result is clear, the market should resolve to Davidson. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the 50-50 scenario doesn't apply. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nDavidson defeated Richmond 69-65 in their Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament matchup on March 12, 2025. The game, held at Capital One Arena in Washington D.C., saw Wildcats' star Reed Bailey lead all scorers with 25 points, supported by Connor Kochera's 22-point performance[8][10][11]. This outcome aligns with multiple verified reports from official team sources (Davidson Wildcats athletics site) and national sports media (Associated Press, NBC Sports)[10][11][12].\n\nThe result was decided through competitive play with Davidson maintaining control in the final minutes. Key moments included:\n- A crucial layup by Bailey with 49.5 seconds remaining to extend Davidson's lead to 67-62[10]\n- Game-clinching free throws from Hunter Adam after Richmond missed a potential go-ahead three-pointer in the final seconds[10]\n\nNo evidence suggests postponement or cancellation, as the game concluded per schedule. Based on the verified outcome and resolution criteria, the market resolves to Davidson's victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
