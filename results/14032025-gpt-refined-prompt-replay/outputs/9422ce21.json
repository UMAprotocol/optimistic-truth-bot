  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know whether Borussia Dortmund or Lille will advance in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. The resolution depends on the outcome of their two-legged tie. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to find out the results of both legs. The first leg is mentioned in several sources. For example, source [7] states that the first leg ended in a 1-1 draw. The second leg is covered in multiple sources like [1], [2], [5], [6], [8], and [10], all indicating that Dortmund won 2-1 in the second leg. \n\nAdding the aggregate score: first leg 1-1, second leg 2-1 for Dortmund. That makes the total aggregate 3-2 in favor of Dortmund. Therefore, Dortmund advances. \n\nI also need to confirm that the match wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources mention the match took place on March 12, 2025, which is before the cutoff date of December 31, 2025. So the 50-50 resolution isn't applicable here. \n\nThe resolution conditions are p1 for Lille, p2 for Dortmund, p3 for 50-50. Since Dortmund advanced, the answer should be p2.\n</think>\n\nBorussia Dortmund advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals after defeating Lille 2-1 in the second leg of their Round of 16 tie on March 12, 2025. The aggregate score across both legs was 3-2 in Dortmund's favor, overturning Lille's early lead in the return match. Key moments included Emre Can's penalty equalizer and Maximilian Beier's decisive winner, securing progression for the German side[1][2][5][6][8][10]. The match concluded without postponement or cancellation, and official UEFA sources confirm the result[6][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
