  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the price of eggs went up in Trump's first month in office, specifically comparing February 2025 to January 2025. The resolution depends on the BLS CPI report for February 2025, which was released on March 12, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the relevant data. Search result [7] is the BLS news release from March 12, 2025. It states that the CPI for eggs increased by 10.4% in February. That's a clear indicator that egg prices rose from January to February 2025. \n\nLooking at other sources, [1] mentions that the CPI for eggs rose 13.8% from December 2024 to January 2025, and [7] shows another increase in February. The January price was a record high of $4.95 per dozen, and by March 4, 2025, it reached $8.15 per dozen according to [1]. However, the exact February price isn't directly stated, but the 10.4% increase in the BLS report [7] confirms an upward trend. \n\nSearch result [6] mentions the average price was around $7.74 as of mid-February, which is higher than January's $4.95. This supports the BLS data. Additionally, [3] is a market prediction that resolved to \"Yes\" with 99% chance, aligning with the actual data. \n\nSince the BLS report [7] is the resolution source and it shows a 10.4% increase in February, the answer should be \"Yes\". Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nEgg prices increased in February 2025 compared to January 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released on March 12, 2025. The **index for eggs rose 10.4% in February**[7], continuing an upward trend that saw prices reach record highs due to ongoing impacts of avian influenza outbreaks and inflationary pressures. \n\nThis follows January's record-high average price of $4.95 per dozen[1], with daily prices reaching $8.15/dozen by March 4[1]. While the exact February average price isn't disclosed in available sources, the 10.4% monthly CPI increase[7] and mid-February reports of $7.74/dozen[6] confirm the upward trajectory. \n\nThe resolution criteria for this market specified using the BLS's February CPI data[3], which unambiguously shows a price increase. Markets tracking this outcome had already priced in a 99% likelihood of \"Yes\" resolutions[3][5].\n\nrecommendation: p2",
