  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Virginia vs. Georgia Tech basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Georgia Tech winning, p2 for Virginia, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the game was played. For example, source [1] from ramblinwreck.com details Georgia Tech's 66-60 victory over Virginia in the ACC Tournament's second round on March 12, 2025. Similarly, source [9] from ESPN and [11] from Virginia's official sports site confirm the same score and outcome. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. Source [10] mentions a canceled game in 2021, but that's irrelevant here. The current game's results are well-documented across multiple sources, so it definitely happened. \n\nSince the game was played and Georgia Tech won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in the relevant 2025 context. All sources agree on the outcome, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe game between Virginia and Georgia Tech scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET was played as planned. Georgia Tech defeated Virginia 66-60 in the second round of the ACC Men's Basketball Tournament[1][9][11]. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred with Georgia Tech advancing to the quarterfinals, ending a 13-game losing streak against Virginia[1][9][12]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by detailed play-by-play accounts and post-game analysis[1][9][11][12]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
