  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4`. Current Unix Timestamp: {current_time}Current Date and Time: {current_datetime}",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how the market will resolve based on the outcome of the Jazz vs. Grizzlies game on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Grizzlies, p2 for Jazz, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 12, 2025. Source [1] provides a detailed box score and summary, confirming the Grizzlies won 122-115. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the sources. \n\nNext, I need to verify the final result. Source [1] clearly states that the Grizzlies won with Kennard and Morant scoring key 3-pointers late in the game. Other sources like [5], [6], and [8] also reference the game happening and the Grizzlies' victory. \n\nSince the game was played and the Grizzlies won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no indication of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable here. All sources align that the event occurred as planned, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Utah Jazz and Memphis Grizzlies scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET was played as planned. According to the box score and game summary[1], the **Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Utah Jazz 122-115**, with Luke Kennard (30 points) and Ja Morant (28 points) leading the Grizzlies. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by the detailed play-by-play and post-game statistics[1][6][8]. \n\nSince the Grizzlies won decisively, the market resolves to **p1** (\"Grizzlies\") based on the ancillary data's resolution conditions. No cancellation or postponement occurred, eliminating the need for a 50-50 resolution (p3). \n\nrecommendation: p1",
