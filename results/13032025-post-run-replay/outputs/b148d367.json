  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741869130\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:32:10",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the price of eggs went up in Trump's first month in office, which would be February 2025 compared to January 2025. The resolution depends on the BLS data for those months. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is March 13, 2025, so the February data should already be released. Let me look at the search results to find the relevant data. \n\nLooking at search result [11], which is from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), it shows the average price for eggs in February 2025 as $5.897 per dozen, up from $4.953 in January 2025. That's a clear increase. \n\nAdditionally, search result [10] is the BLS Consumer Price Index report for February 2025, which mentions a 10.4% increase in egg prices from January to February. The CPI report confirms the rise, so the data is official and reliable. \n\nOther sources like [1], [3], and [5] also discuss rising egg prices due to avian flu and other factors, but the key here is the specific January to February 2025 comparison. The FRED data and BLS report are the direct sources needed to resolve this query. \n\nSince the February price is higher than January's, the answer should be \"Yes,\" which corresponds to p2. However, I should also check if there's any conflicting information. All sources point to an increase, so p2 is the correct recommendation.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
