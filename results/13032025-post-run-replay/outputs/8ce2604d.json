  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741868279\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:17:59",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know how to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Charlotte vs. Rice college basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: Charlotte win resolves to p2, Rice win to p1, postponed stays open, canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to verify if the game has already occurred. The current date and time provided are March 13, 2025, 13:17:25, which is the day after the scheduled game. So the game should have taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [5] from ESPN shows a final score of Charlotte 64-61 Rice, dated March 12, 2025. That's a direct indication that the game happened and Charlotte won. However, I need to cross-reference other sources to ensure accuracy. \n\nResult [3] from Bleacher Nation also mentions the game as part of the AAC Tournament, predicting a Rice win but the actual result might differ. Result [7] from Docs Sports provides a detailed recap of the game, confirming Charlotte's victory with a final score of 64-61. Additionally, result [8] from OddsShark notes that Charlotte has a strong history against Rice, which might be historical data but doesn't contradict the actual result.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Result [1] from Rice University's athletics site states their commitment to playing scheduled games, with postponements or cancellations communicated. However, since the ESPN result [5] and Docs Sports [7] both report the game as having occurred, it's safe to conclude the game wasn't postponed or canceled.\n\nTherefore, based on the verified final score from multiple sources, the market should resolve to p2 (Charlotte). The answer must end with the recommendation line as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
