  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741866636\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:50:36",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the MD Eastern Shore vs. Norfolk State basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Norfolk State winning, p2 for MD Eastern Shore, and p3 if the game is canceled. The current date is March 13, 2025, so the game has already taken place.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the actual outcome. Looking through the provided sources:\n\n- Search result [1] from nsuspartans.com states that Norfolk State won 77-70 against UMES (Maryland Eastern Shore) in the MEAC Tournament quarterfinal on March 12. Jalen Myers led with 22 points.\n- Source [2] from hbcugameday.com confirms the same score, 77-70, with Norfolk State advancing. Evan Johnson from UMES scored 22 points but they lost.\n- Another source [6] from cbssports.com also reports the 77-70 victory for Norfolk State, led by Jalen Myers' 22 points.\n- The other sources [3], [4], [5], [7], [8] either discuss historical matchups, betting tips, or future schedules, but don't contradict the game result.\n\nAll the relevant sources agree that Norfolk State won the game. The user's timestamp is March 13, 2025, which is after the game date. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, the correct resolution should be p1 (Norfolk State). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Sources [3] and [4] mention past games but don't affect the March 12 result. The betting tips in [3] predicted an over/under but don't change the outcome. Since all recent and direct sources confirm Norfolk State's win, the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
