  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741864861\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:21:01",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to resolve whether Trump said \"Tariff\" five or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. Let me check the search results provided.\n\nLooking through the sources, multiple transcripts and articles mention Trump discussing tariffs extensively during the meeting. For example, in source [13], he specifically mentions imposing a 200% tariff on pharmaceutical companies moving to Ireland. Source [14] notes his vow to respond to EU tariffs and mentions reciprocal tariffs. Source [17] quotes Trump saying \"reciprocal tariffs\" and discussing the EU's actions. Additionally, sources [7], [9], and [18] all reference Trump's use of the term \"tariff\" in the context of trade with Ireland and the EU. Counting these instances across the transcripts and articles, it's clear he used the term multiple times, exceeding five mentions. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes,\" corresponding to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
