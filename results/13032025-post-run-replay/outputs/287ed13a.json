  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741868794\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:26:34",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a prediction market based on whether the Montreal Canadiens or Seattle Kraken won the game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's outcome using the provided search results. The current date is March 13, 2025, so the game has already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [8]) report that the Seattle Kraken defeated the Montreal Canadiens 5-4 in overtime. The key detail here is Brandon Mountour's record-breaking overtime goal just four seconds into the period, which secured the Kraken's victory. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having occurred on March 12, with detailed stats and player performances, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the Kraken won, the resolution should be p1. The user's instructions state that if the event is in the past and verified, the answer must be based on concrete evidence. All sources align, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Montreal Canadiens and Seattle Kraken scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET concluded with the Seattle Kraken defeating the Montreal Canadiens 5-4 in overtime[1][2][3][4][8]. The decisive goal occurred just four seconds into overtime when Brandon Mountour scored the fastest overtime goal in NHL history[1][4][8]. This result was verified through multiple independent game recaps and statistical summaries from authoritative sports media outlets[1][2][3][4][8]. The game was played as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][2][3][4][6][8].\n\n**recommendation: p1**",
