  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741868245\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:17:25",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a query about a prediction market resolution for a college basketball game between North Carolina Central and MD Eastern Shore. The game was originally scheduled for February 22, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are: if NC Central wins, resolve to p2; if MD Eastern Shore wins, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, resolve 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled or if there were any postponements. Looking at the search results, there's mention of multiple games being postponed due to weather. Specifically, result [2] states that the game between NC Central and MD Eastern Shore was postponed from February 22 to February 26 because of inclement weather. So the original date's game was postponed.\n\nThen, looking at result [7], the game on February 26, 2025, between NC Central and MD Eastern Shore took place. The final score was MD Eastern Shore 68, NC Central 59. MD Eastern Shore won, so according to the resolution conditions, that should resolve to p1. But wait, the user's resolution conditions mention that if the game is postponed, the market remains open until completion. Since the game was postponed but eventually played on February 26, the market should resolve based on the outcome of that rescheduled game.\n\nWait, but the user's query says \"if the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\" So the market didn't resolve on the original date but remained open. The game was played on February 26, and MD Eastern Shore won. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n\nBut let me double-check the dates. The current timestamp given is March 13, 2025, so the game on February 26 has already occurred. The search result [7] confirms the outcome: MD Eastern Shore won 68-59. Therefore, the event has occurred, and the result is known. There's no cancellation here; the game was postponed and then played. So the market should resolve to p1 (MD Eastern Shore) as per the conditions. There's no mention of the game being canceled, only postponed and then completed. Thus, the resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
