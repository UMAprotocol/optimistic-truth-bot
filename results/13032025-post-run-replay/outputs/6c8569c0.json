  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741868559\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:22:39",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how to resolve the UMA optimistic oracle request for the Iowa vs. Ohio State game that was scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. The key here is to determine if the event happened as planned and what the outcome was. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time provided in the personalization section. It says the current time is March 13, 2025, 13:19:02. The game was on March 12, so it's already in the past. That's good because future events would resolve to p4, but since it's past, I can look into the results.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the outcome. The first search result [1] is from Eleven Warriors, dated 2025-03-13, stating that Ohio State lost to Iowa 77-70 in the Big Ten Tournament. Another source [4] from CBS Sports on the same date confirms the score, mentioning Brock Harding's late 3-pointer helping Iowa win. Result [9] from Fox Sports also reports Iowa's 77-70 victory. Additionally, the official Iowa Hawkeyes website [11] has a detailed recap of their 77-70 win over Ohio State. \n\nAll these sources are consistent and credible, showing that the game took place as scheduled and Iowa won. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. Since the event occurred and the result is clear, the resolution should be p2, which corresponds to Iowa winning. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all the sources align. The user's ancillary data specifies that if Iowa wins, it's p2, and the game wasn't postponed or canceled. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
