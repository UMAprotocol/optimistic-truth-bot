  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741871670\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 14:14:30",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about a prediction market resolution for the South Carolina vs. Arkansas basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The task is to determine whether the market should resolve to Arkansas (p1), South Carolina (p2), or 50-50 (p3) based on the outcome of the game. However, the current timestamp is March 13, 2025, 14:11:05, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether the game actually took place. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the game occurred on March 12. For example, result [2] states that South Carolina's season ended with a loss to Arkansas on March 12, 2025. Similarly, result [4] from SI.com discusses Arkansas' win over South Carolina in the SEC Tournament on March 12. Result [6] from The Daily Gamecock also reports the game's outcome as a 72-68 victory for Arkansas. Additionally, result [11] from Hawg Beat confirms Arkansas won 72-68, and ESPN's highlight in result [13] corroborates the final score. These multiple credible sources all confirm that the game was played and that Arkansas won.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's any indication the game was postponed or canceled. None of the search results mention a postponement or cancellation. All sources discuss the game as having taken place on the scheduled date with a clear outcome. The Arkansas Razorbacks' official website (result [14]) also lists the game result, further confirming it was played as planned.\n\nSince the game occurred and Arkansas won, the market should resolve to Arkansas (p1). The user's personalization instructions specify that if the event has already happened and the outcome is verified, the correct resolution is p1. There's no need to consider p3 (canceled) or p2 (South Carolina win) because the result is clear and documented by multiple sources. \n\nIt's important to ensure that all citations are correctly applied. Each mention of the game's outcome should reference the relevant search results. For instance, citing the exact scores and details from sources [2], [4], [6], [11], and [13] will support the conclusion. \n\nFinally, verifying the timestamp again: the current date is March 13, 2025, so the game on March 12 is in the past. All sources are from March 12 or 13, confirming the game's completion. Therefore, the resolution is straightforward as Arkansas won, and the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
