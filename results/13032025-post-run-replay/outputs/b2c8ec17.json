  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741864706\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:18:26",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Hell\" three or more times during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on video evidence of that specific event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for mentions of Trump's statements during that presser. The search results include multiple sources. Let's look through them. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions the meeting but doesn't quote Trump using \"Hell.\" Result [4] and [14] both have the same content where Trump says Ireland is taking advantage of the US, but the exact quotes aren't provided. Result [16] from Apex News describes an awkward moment where Trump talks about tariffs and Ireland. The article says Trump claimed the EU was set up to take advantage of the US and when asked if Ireland does too, he replies, \"Of course they are.\" The article then mentions Trump saying, \"We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue,\" but there's no mention of \"Hell\" here. \n\nWait, in result [16], the article states: \"Poor Martin probably wanted the ground to swallow him up at this point - but little did he know, things were about to get a hell of a lot more awkward.\" Here, the word \"hell\" is used in the article's narrative, not in a direct quote from Trump. That doesn't count because it's the author's wording, not Trump's.\n\nLooking at result [3], [4], and [14], they mention the St. Patrick's Day event but don't provide specific quotes from the press conference. Result [15] is a duplicate of [1], which again doesn't have quotes with \"Hell.\"\n\nResult [5] and [7] discuss Iran's president telling Trump to \"do whatever the hell you want,\" but that's a different event. Result [6], [12], and [18] are about Trump's comments on Hamas and hostages, where he uses \"hell\" multiple times, but those are from February, not the March 12 press conference with Ireland's PM.\n\nResult [16] is the most detailed account of the March 12 meeting. The article quotes Trump as saying, \"We have been abused for a long time, and we will be abused no longer,\" and mentions his criticism of the EU and Ireland. However, in the direct quotes provided, Trump doesn't use the word \"hell.\" The only instance of \"hell\" in the article is the author's own description, not Trump's words.\n\nSince none of the search results show Trump using \"Hell\" during the March 12 press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin, and the only instance is in the article's narrative, the answer should be \"No.\" The user's query specifies that the term must be spoken by Trump during the event, and the provided sources don't support that. Therefore, the resolution is p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
