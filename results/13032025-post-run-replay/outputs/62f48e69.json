  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741867686\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:08:06",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Richmond vs. Davidson men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 11:30 AM ET. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is March 13, 2025, 13:06:40 UTC, which is the day after the game was supposed to take place. That means the game should have already occurred. Now, I need to look through the search results to find out the actual result of the game.\n\nLooking at the search results, especially the ones from March 12, 2025, I see multiple sources indicating that Davidson won. For instance, result [2] from Davidson's official site states they won 69-65. Result [4] from ESPN also confirms the score as Davidson 69-65 Richmond. There's a YouTube video in result [9] titled \"Richmond vs. Davidson | A-10 TOURNAMENT HIGHLIGHTS | 3/12/25\" which mentions Davidson advancing. Additionally, result [8] from CBS Sports and [5] from NCAA.com both list the final score in favor of Davidson. \n\nAll these sources are consistent and from reputable sports sites or the universities' official athletics pages. There's no conflicting information in the search results about the outcome. The women's lacrosse game mentioned in result [6] is a different sport and not relevant here. \n\nSince the game took place on March 12, which is before the current timestamp, and all sources confirm Davidson's victory, the market should resolve to Davidson. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 (50-50) doesn't apply. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 (Davidson).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
