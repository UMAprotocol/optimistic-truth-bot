  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741869633\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:40:33",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by figuring out what the user is asking. They want to know how to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NBA game between the LA Clippers and Miami Heat on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on who won the game. The user provided several search results, so I need to check those to determine the actual result.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results for any mention of the game's outcome. Result [3] from CBS News says the Clippers beat the Heat 119-104. That's a direct report of the final score. Also, result [12] mentions the Clippers won with a score of 119-104, and [14] from ESPN confirms the same score. There are YouTube videos ([6], [8], [9], [10], [11]) titled with highlights from the game, which likely show the Clippers' victory. \n\nI need to make sure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game happening on March 12, and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. The detailed stats in [15] also back up that the game was played as scheduled.\n\nSince the Clippers won, the market should resolve to \"Clippers,\" which is p2. The user's instructions say to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the current timestamp is March 13, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
