  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865613\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:33:33",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Fresno State vs. Nevada basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 4:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins the game. The current date is March 13, 2025, so the game should have already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether the game actually took place and what the result was. Checking the search results provided:\n\nSearch result [1] is from CBS Sports and dated March 12, 2025. The headline says \"Sanders scores 17 as Nevada takes down Fresno State 86-71 in Mountain West Conference Tournament.\" The detailed recap mentions Nevada won 86-71. The article also states the date as March 12, 2025, which matches the game date in the query.\n\nSearch result [2] is another CBS Sports article with the same title and details, confirming the Nevada victory. It also mentions the date as March 12, 2025.\n\nSearch result [6] from ESPN lists the final score as Nevada 86-71 Fresno State, with the game occurring on March 12, 2025. This corroborates the outcome.\n\nOther results like [3], [4], [5], [7], [8] provide additional context about previous matchups and statistics but aren't necessary for confirming this specific game's result since the date and outcome are clearly stated in the first few sources.\n\nGiven that the game was played on March 12, 2025, as scheduled, and multiple reputable sources (CBS Sports, ESPN) report Nevada's victory with a score of 86-71, the market should resolve to Nevada. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution is straightforward. The final answer should be p1 (Nevada). \n\nI need to make sure the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. The user's current time is March 13, 2025, which is after March 12, so the event has occurred. No future consideration is needed here. All sources confirm the game happened and Nevada won, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
