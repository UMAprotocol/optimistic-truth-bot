  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741870781\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:59:41",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. First, I need to determine whether the Northwestern vs. Minnesota game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET has already occurred based on the current date and time provided (March 13, 2025, 13:58:44 UTC). Since the current date is March 13, 2025, which is the day after the game's scheduled date, I need to check if the game took place as planned.\n\nLooking through the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [5], [8], [13], [14]) confirm that the game was played on March 12, 2025. Specifically, search result [1] states that Northwestern defeated Minnesota 72-64 in the Big Ten Tournament opener on March 12. Similarly, [2] and [14] provide detailed accounts of the game, including player statistics and the final score. These reports are from reputable sports news outlets and the official NCAA website, which adds credibility.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions emphasize that the resolution depends on the outcome of the game. Since the game has already been played and Northwestern won, the correct resolution should be p2 (Northwestern). The sources consistently report Northwestern's victory, so there's no ambiguity here. Additionally, there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the search results, ruling out p3 or p4. The current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, confirming it's a past event. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
