  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741869381\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:36:21",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if Trump will say the word \"Heritage\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he uses that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to Yes (p2) if he does, No (p1) if not, or p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of Trump using the word \"Heritage\" during that specific event. Let's go through the sources:\n\n1. Search result [2] from RT\u00c9 News on March 12 mentions Trump's speech at the shamrock ceremony. He talked about Irish heritage in his cabinet members but didn't specifically say \"Heritage\" in the quoted parts. \n\n2. Search result [3] from Politico details Trump's meeting with Martin. The article discusses trade issues but doesn't mention Trump using \"Heritage.\"\n\n3. Search result [6] from The Independent covers the pronunciation of \"Taoiseach\" but no mention of \"Heritage.\"\n\n4. Search result [16] from KMPH News reports on the meeting, focusing on Ukraine and tariffs. No mention of \"Heritage\" in the context of the press conference.\n\n5. Search result [17] from gov.ie's news section notes the presentation of shamrock but doesn't include any quotes with \"Heritage.\"\n\n6. Other sources like [5], [7], [18] discuss Irish-American Heritage Month but not the press conference itself.\n\nLooking for direct references to the term \"Heritage\" in the context of the March 12 event: None of the search results show Trump using the word \"Heritage\" during the press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin. The mentions of \"heritage\" in other contexts (like Irish-American Heritage Month) are from earlier proclamations, not the March 12 event.\n\nAdditionally, the Heritage Foundation is mentioned in other contexts (like Project 2025 in search results [9], [10], [12], [13]), but those are unrelated to the press conference with the Irish PM. The user's query is specifically about the press conference on March 12, 2025.\n\nSince there's no evidence in the provided sources that Trump used the word \"Heritage\" during that press conference, the resolution should be \"No.\" However, I need to confirm that all relevant sources were checked and that there's no mention of the term in the event's coverage. All the cited materials from March 12 don't include the term in Trump's remarks. Therefore, the answer is No, corresponding to p1. But wait, the resolution conditions list p1 as No, p2 as Yes. So the correct recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
