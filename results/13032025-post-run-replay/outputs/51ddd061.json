  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741871231\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 14:07:11",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to resolve this UMA optimistic oracle request about the CSU Bakersfield vs. UC Santa Barbara basketball game. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to CSU Bakersfield, UC Santa Barbara, or if it's a 50-50 outcome based on whether the game was played, postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I check the current date and time: March 13, 2025, 14:05:46 UTC. The game was scheduled for March 12 at 9 PM ET, which is March 13 at 2 AM UTC. Since the current time is after that, the game should have already happened. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources confirming the game occurred. The Big West article [1] states that UC Santa Barbara won 71-66. The UC Santa Barbara athletics site [9] and CBS Sports [11] also report the same score. The ESPN game summary [12] lists the final score as 71-66 in favor of UCSB. Additionally, the box score from the game [8] provides detailed stats, confirming the outcome.\n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game as completed. Therefore, the market should resolve to UC Santa Barbara (p1). Since the event has occurred and the result is verified through multiple credible sources, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
