  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741866438\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:47:18",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know how the UMA optimistic oracle should resolve a market based on the outcome of the Sabres vs. Red Wings game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Red Wings win, p2 for Sabres win, p3 if the game is canceled, and p4 if the event hasn't occurred yet.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current timestamp provided is March 13, 2025, 12:45:36 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 12 at 7:30 PM ET. Since March 12 in Eastern Time is earlier than March 13 UTC, the game should have already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, especially [2], [4], [6], and [7], there are multiple sources confirming that the game took place on March 12, 2025. The Detroit Red Wings won with a score of 7-3 against the Buffalo Sabres. These sources are reputable, including ESPN and NHL.com, which are reliable for sports results.\n\nThe user's instructions mention that if the event is in the future, we should return p4. However, since the game occurred before the current timestamp, it's not a future event. The results clearly show the Red Wings won, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled, but all sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. There's no information suggesting a cancellation or postponement. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (Red Wings) based on the verified outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Red Wings defeated the Buffalo Sabres 7-3 in their NHL game played on March 12, 2025, at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. Multiple authoritative sources including ESPN[4], Sportsnet[2], and NHL.com[7] confirm the final score and outcome of this game, which occurred prior to the current timestamp of March 13, 2025. The market resolution conditions specify that a Red Wings victory corresponds to **p1**. As the game has concluded with Detroit's victory, there is no basis for considering postponement, cancellation, or alternative outcomes.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
