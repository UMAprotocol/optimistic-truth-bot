  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741868857\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 13:27:37",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether the DePaul vs. Georgetown men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 6:30 PM ET resulted in a DePaul win, a Georgetown win, was postponed, or canceled. The resolution depends on the actual outcome of that game based on verifiable facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time provided: March 13, 2025, 1:26:34 PM UTC. The game was supposed to happen on March 12 at 6:30 PM ET, which is March 12 at 10:30 PM UTC. Since the current timestamp is March 13, the game has already occurred. Therefore, the event is in the past, so I don't need to worry about it being a future event.\n\nNext, I'll review the search results to find evidence of the game's outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results:\n- Result [1] from bigeast.com mentions DePaul defeating Georgetown 71-67 on March 12, 2025, advancing to the quarterfinals. This is a primary source from the conference's official site, which is highly reliable.\n- Result [3] from cbssports.com also reports DePaul's 71-67 victory over Georgetown in the Big East Tournament on March 12, 2025, with detailed stats.\n- Result [5] from depaulbluedemons.com, the official DePaul athletics site, confirms the win with a score of 71-67, noting Chris Holtmann's first BIG EAST tournament win.\n- Result [6] from cbsnews.com and [10] from washingtontimes.com both repeat the same score and outcome, with Benson scoring 18 points off the bench.\n- Result [8] from depauliaonline.com states the final score as DePaul 71, Georgetown 67, and mentions it's the first round of the Big East Tournament.\n- Result [12] from guhoyas.com, Georgetown's official athletics site, acknowledges their loss to DePaul with the same score, including quotes from their coach.\n\nAll these sources are consistent in reporting DePaul's victory with a 71-67 score. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The game clearly took place as scheduled, and DePaul won. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"DePaul,\" which corresponds to p2 according to the resolution conditions provided.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
