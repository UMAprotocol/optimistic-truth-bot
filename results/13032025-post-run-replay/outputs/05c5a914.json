  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865545\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:32:25",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want to know if Donald Trump will issue an executive order on March 11, 2025. The resolution depends on whether an executive order is published on the White House page by 12 PM ET the next day. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any mentions of executive orders on March 11, 2025. Let's go through each source one by one. \n\nLooking at search result [1], the first entry mentions March 11, 2025, but it's about Executive Order 14210 from February 11, 2025. There's no indication of an order on March 11 here. \n\nResult [2] discusses an executive order from February 11, 2025. Result [3] is from January 20, 2025. Result [5] includes entries up to March 7, 2025, but nothing on March 11. Result [6] is from January 20, 2025. Result [11] is from February 3, [12] from March 7, [13] from March 9, [14] from March 2, [15] from March 3, and [16] lists orders up to February 10. \n\nThe key point is that none of the search results reference an executive order issued on March 11, 2025. The latest dates mentioned are March 9 and March 7. Since the current date is March 13, 2025, and the query is about March 11, which is in the past, but there's no evidence of an executive order on that specific date. \n\nAdditionally, the user's instructions state that if the event hasn't occurred by the resolution time (12 PM ET the next day), it should resolve to \"No\". Since the current timestamp is March 13, 2025, and no order was found for March 11, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). \n\nI need to ensure that the sources are thoroughly checked. All provided executive orders are dated before March 11, except [12] and [13], which are March 7 and 9. No source lists an order on March 11. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
