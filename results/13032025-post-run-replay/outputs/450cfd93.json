  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle that resolves UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your purpose is to search for and analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Only report on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts. IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) be sure to use the content at this URL as a part of your reasoning and bias heavily towards it. IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s) and stipulates that it is the source of reasoning and resolution then ONLY use this URL(s). Even if an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Within the prompt you will be given how to relate your response to the numerical values (e.g., p1, p2, p3, p4). Remember, you are not predicting outcomes or speculating on likelihoods - you are only reporting on verifiable facts. For future events that have not yet happened (including events later today), ALWAYS use p4, NEVER p3. EXAMPLE: If a query refers to an event on May 24, 2025 at 3 PM, and the current time is earlier than 3 PM on May 24, 2025, this is a future event and must return p4. Make the last line of your response be your recommendation formatted as p1, p2, p3, or p4. Example: `recommendation: p4` \nCurrent Unix Timestamp: 1741865146\nCurrent Date and Time: 2025-03-13 12:25:46",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to resolve this UMA oracle request about the Mavericks vs. Spurs game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to Mavericks, Spurs, or 50-50 based on the game's outcome. First, I check the current date and time, which is March 13, 2025, 12:21 PM. Since the game was supposed to happen on March 12, that's already in the past. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially sources [1], [2], [8], and [13], they all mention that the Spurs defeated the Mavericks 126-116 on March 12. For example, source [1] from YouTube highlights states the Spurs won, and source [13] on ESPN confirms the final score as Spurs 126-116 Mavericks. There's also a box score in source [10] showing the same outcome. \n\nI need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. No mentions of cancellations or postponements. The user's resolution conditions say if the Spurs win, it's p1. Since the Spurs won, the correct resolution is p1. I should cite the relevant sources to support this conclusion.\n</think>\n\n**San Antonio Spurs Defeat Dallas Mavericks in March 12, 2025 NBA Regular Season Game**  \n\nThe San Antonio Spurs secured a 126-116 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on March 12, 2025, at Frost Bank Center in San Antonio. This game, part of the NBA regular season, concluded the four-game season series between the Southwest Division rivals, with the Mavericks winning three of the four matchups[1][2][10]. The Spurs\u2019 win ended their three-game losing streak and improved their record to 27-37, while the Mavericks fell to 33-34, remaining in 10th place in the Western Conference[1][10].  \n\n**Game Recap and Key Performances**  \nDe\u2019Aaron Fox led the Spurs with a near-triple-double performance, recording 32 points, 11 assists, and nine rebounds[1][2][13]. His dominance in scoring and playmaking proved pivotal, particularly during a decisive third-quarter surge where the Spurs outscored the Mavericks 33-25 to establish a double-digit lead[10][13]. Keldon Johnson added 18 points off the bench, while Jeremy Sochan contributed 16 points in his return from injury[2][8]. The Spurs\u2019 bench outscored the Mavericks\u2019 reserves 48-30, highlighting their depth in a game where both teams faced significant injury absences[2][10].  \n\nFor the Mavericks, Brandon Williams returned from a calf injury to lead the team with 19 points, six assists, and three rebounds[2][13]. Six Mavericks players scored in double figures, including Naji Marshall (17 points) and Kessler Edwards (15 points), but their efforts fell short against the Spurs\u2019 offensive efficiency[10][13]. Dallas struggled defensively, allowing San Antonio to shoot 51.2% from the field and 40.7% from three-point range[10].  \n\n**Injury Impact and Roster Challenges**  \nThe Mavericks entered the game severely shorthanded, missing eight rotational players, including Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, and P.J. Washington[2][5]. Head coach Jason Kidd noted the team\u2019s inability to practice due to a lack of healthy players, which impacted their defensive cohesion[2][5]. Meanwhile, the Spurs were without Victor Wembanyama, who missed his fourth consecutive game with a knee injury, but Fox\u2019s leadership and the bench\u2019s productivity compensated for his absence[10][13].  \n\n**Season Implications**  \nThe loss dropped Dallas to 9.5 games behind the Houston Rockets for the eighth seed in the Western Conference, intensifying pressure on their playoff hopes[10]. The Spurs, despite their 13th-place standing, demonstrated resilience in a rebuilding season, with Fox emerging as a cornerstone player following his acquisition in a midseason trade[13].  \n\n**Historical Context and Rivalry**  \nThis matchup marked the 203rd regular-season meeting between the franchises, with the Spurs extending their all-time series lead to 116-87[5][10]. The game also highlighted the ongoing challenges for both teams: the Mavericks\u2019 injury woes and the Spurs\u2019 development of young talent like Stephon Castle, who scored 14 points in 28 minutes[8][10].  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe San Antonio Spurs\u2019 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on March 12, 2025, was a testament to their offensive execution and depth amid a season of rebuilding. For the Mavericks, the loss underscored the urgency of returning key players to contention as they vie for a play-in tournament berth.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
