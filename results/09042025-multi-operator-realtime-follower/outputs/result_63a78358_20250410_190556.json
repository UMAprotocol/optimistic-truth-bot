The resolution depends on any federal legislation or executive action by Trump that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs on Sri Lankan imports by April 30, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any relevant information. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Search Result [1]**: Mentions that the increased reciprocal tariffs on Sri Lanka (44%) were set to start on April 9th. This was from April 3rd, 2025.\n2. **Search Result [3]**: A YouTube transcript from April 6th states that the 44% tariffs would take full effect on April 9th. It also mentions a Sri Lankan delegation planning to visit the US to negotiate.\n3. **Search Result [5]**: KLGates article from April 2nd details Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs starting April 5th, with higher rates (like Sri Lanka's 44%) effective April 9th.\n4. **Search Result [7]**: Peoples Dispatch from April 7th discusses the impact of the 44% tariff on Sri Lanka's debt crisis, indicating the tariff was already in effect.\n5. **Search Result [9]**: Tamil Guardian from April 9th reports that the 44% tariff was implemented and that Sri Lanka's president wrote to Trump appealing for a rollback. It also mentions an all-party meeting on April 10th.\n6. **Search Result [14]**: Daily Mirror from April 9th states Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs, reducing them to a universal 10% during negotiations. This applies to Sri Lanka but not China.\n7. **Search Result [15]**: TradingView news from April 10th confirms the tariff pause, leading to a stock market surge in Sri Lanka. The pause lowers the tariff to 10% for 90 days.\n8. **Search Result [16]**: JNS.org article from April 9th mentions the 90-day pause, reducing tariffs to 10% for over 75 countries, including Israel, but doesn't explicitly name Sri Lanka. However, the context suggests Sri Lanka is included.\n9. **Search Result [17]**: Adaderana.lk from April 9th reports Trump pausing tariffs for 90 days on many countries (lowering to 10%) while increasing China's to 125%. The source is Reuters, which is credible.\n\nPutting this together: The original 44% tariff on Sri Lanka was set to start on April 9th. However, on April 9th, Trump announced a 90-day pause, reducing the tariff to 10% during negotiations. This meets the query's condition because it's an executive action (under IEEPA) that pauses the higher tariff, effectively lowering it to 10% within the April timeframe. The action was officially enacted on April 9th, which is before April 30th. \n\nEven though the 10% is still a tariff, the query specifies that any action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs counts. The pause from 44% to 10% is a reduction, so it qualifies. The resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Sri Lanka in April 2025. The resolution depends on any federal legislation or executive action by Trump that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs on Sri Lankan imports by April 30, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any relevant information. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Search Result [1]**: Mentions that the increased reciprocal tariffs on Sri Lanka (44%) were set to start on April 9th. This was from April 3rd, 2025.\n2. **Search Result [3]**: A YouTube transcript from April 6th states that the 44% tariffs would take full effect on April 9th. It also mentions a Sri Lankan delegation planning to visit the US to negotiate.\n3. **Search Result [5]**: KLGates article from April 2nd details Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs starting April 5th, with higher rates (like Sri Lanka's 44%) effective April 9th.\n4. **Search Result [7]**: Peoples Dispatch from April 7th discusses the impact of the 44% tariff on Sri Lanka's debt crisis, indicating the tariff was already in effect.\n5. **Search Result [9]**: Tamil Guardian from April 9th reports that the 44% tariff was implemented and that Sri Lanka's president wrote to Trump appealing for a rollback. It also mentions an all-party meeting on April 10th.\n6. **Search Result [14]**: Daily Mirror from April 9th states Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs, reducing them to a universal 10% during negotiations. This applies to Sri Lanka but not China.\n7. **Search Result [15]**: TradingView news from April 10th confirms the tariff pause, leading to a stock market surge in Sri Lanka. The pause lowers the tariff to 10% for 90 days.\n8. **Search Result [16]**: JNS.org article from April 9th mentions the 90-day pause, reducing tariffs to 10% for over 75 countries, including Israel, but doesn't explicitly name Sri Lanka. However, the context suggests Sri Lanka is included.\n9. **Search Result [17]**: Adaderana.lk from April 9th reports Trump pausing tariffs for 90 days on many countries (lowering to 10%) while increasing China's to 125%. The source is Reuters, which is credible.\n\nPutting this together: The original 44% tariff on Sri Lanka was set to start on April 9th. However, on April 9th, Trump announced a 90-day pause, reducing the tariff to 10% during negotiations. This meets the query's condition because it's an executive action (under IEEPA) that pauses the higher tariff, effectively lowering it to 10% within the April timeframe. The action was officially enacted on April 9th, which is before April 30th. \n\nEven though the 10% is still a tariff, the query specifies that any action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs counts. The pause from 44% to 10% is a reduction, so it qualifies. The resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.55, ID: 58060627262780933358576967351455757553405461168400146550152852264681719040334, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.45, ID: 68567685685046977173434149656772425354949102692188392782173131626992035234088, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.550, NO: 0.450)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744311835 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 19:03:55 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Sri Lanka in April 2025. The resolution depends on any federal legislation or executive action by Trump that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs on Sri Lankan imports by April 30, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any relevant information. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Search Result [1]**: Mentions that the increased reciprocal tariffs on Sri Lanka (44%) were set to start on April 9th. This was from April 3rd, 2025.\n2. **Search Result [3]**: A YouTube transcript from April 6th states that the 44% tariffs would take full effect on April 9th. It also mentions a Sri Lankan delegation planning to visit the US to negotiate.\n3. **Search Result [5]**: KLGates article from April 2nd details Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs starting April 5th, with higher rates (like Sri Lanka's 44%) effective April 9th.\n4. **Search Result [7]**: Peoples Dispatch from April 7th discusses the impact of the 44% tariff on Sri Lanka's debt crisis, indicating the tariff was already in effect.\n5. **Search Result [9]**: Tamil Guardian from April 9th reports that the 44% tariff was implemented and that Sri Lanka's president wrote to Trump appealing for a rollback. It also mentions an all-party meeting on April 10th.\n6. **Search Result [14]**: Daily Mirror from April 9th states Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs, reducing them to a universal 10% during negotiations. This applies to Sri Lanka but not China.\n7. **Search Result [15]**: TradingView news from April 10th confirms the tariff pause, leading to a stock market surge in Sri Lanka. The pause lowers the tariff to 10% for 90 days.\n8. **Search Result [16]**: JNS.org article from April 9th mentions the 90-day pause, reducing tariffs to 10% for over 75 countries, including Israel, but doesn't explicitly name Sri Lanka. However, the context suggests Sri Lanka is included.\n9. **Search Result [17]**: Adaderana.lk from April 9th reports Trump pausing tariffs for 90 days on many countries (lowering to 10%) while increasing China's to 125%. The source is Reuters, which is credible.\n\nPutting this together: The original 44% tariff on Sri Lanka was set to start on April 9th. However, on April 9th, Trump announced a 90-day pause, reducing the tariff to 10% during negotiations. This meets the query's condition because it's an executive action (under IEEPA) that pauses the higher tariff, effectively lowering it to 10% within the April timeframe. The action was officially enacted on April 9th, which is before April 30th. \n\nEven though the 10% is still a tariff, the query specifies that any action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs counts. The pause from 44% to 10% is a reduction, so it qualifies. The resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.55, ID: 58060627262780933358576967351455757553405461168400146550152852264681719040334, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.45, ID: 68567685685046977173434149656772425354949102692188392782173131626992035234088, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.550, NO: 0.450)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744311835 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 19:03:55 UTC",
