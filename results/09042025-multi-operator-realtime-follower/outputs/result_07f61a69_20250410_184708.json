The market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's any federal legislation or executive action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Cambodia. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of tariffs on Cambodia. From the search results, especially [1], [2], and [8], it's clear that on April 2, 2025, Trump announced a 49% reciprocal tariff on Cambodia, which was part of his \"Liberation Day\" initiative. This was in addition to a 10% baseline tariff on all imports. The 49% rate was the highest among all countries, indicating Cambodia was hit hard.\n\nNow, looking for any updates or changes after April 2. Search result [3] from April 10 mentions that Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most countries but excluded China. However, the article also states that the steepest tariffs included 49% on Cambodia, 46% on Vietnam, etc. But then it says Canada was... (the rest is cut off). Wait, in [3], the Financial Post article from April 10 says Trump paused tariffs on most countries but raised China's to 125%. The key point here is whether Cambodia was included in the pause.\n\nLooking at [10], Deutsche Wealth's insight on April 10 confirms that the 90-day pause applies to all countries except China. The original reciprocal tariffs for countries like Vietnam and Cambodia were upwards of 45%, but with the pause, the rate is reduced to 10% during the 90 days. However, the article specifically mentions that China's rate is now 125%, but for others, the reciprocal tariffs are paused. So Cambodia's 49% reciprocal tariff would be paused, leaving only the 10% baseline. \n\nBut the user's query is about whether Trump took any action to lower, pause, delay, or remove tariffs specifically targeting Cambodia. The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs would mean that the additional 49% is paused, effectively reducing the total tariff from 59% (10% baseline + 49% reciprocal) to just 10%. However, the ancillary data specifies that only the removal of tariffs specifically targeting Cambodia counts. The 10% baseline is a general tariff on all imports, so pausing the reciprocal part (which was specific to Cambodia) would count as a pause on the Cambodia-specific tariff. \n\nTherefore, the 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs would qualify as a pause on the Cambodia-specific tariffs. Since this action was taken on April 10, within the April 30 deadline, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nI need to confirm that the pause applies to Cambodia. [10] mentions that the 90-day pause includes countries with reciprocal tariffs upwards of 45%, like Vietnam and Cambodia. Also, [11] states that the pause applies to nearly all US imports except China. Therefore, Cambodia's 49% reciprocal tariff is paused, meeting the resolution condition for \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user is asking whether Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Cambodia by April 30, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's any federal legislation or executive action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Cambodia. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of tariffs on Cambodia. From the search results, especially [1], [2], and [8], it's clear that on April 2, 2025, Trump announced a 49% reciprocal tariff on Cambodia, which was part of his \"Liberation Day\" initiative. This was in addition to a 10% baseline tariff on all imports. The 49% rate was the highest among all countries, indicating Cambodia was hit hard.\n\nNow, looking for any updates or changes after April 2. Search result [3] from April 10 mentions that Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most countries but excluded China. However, the article also states that the steepest tariffs included 49% on Cambodia, 46% on Vietnam, etc. But then it says Canada was... (the rest is cut off). Wait, in [3], the Financial Post article from April 10 says Trump paused tariffs on most countries but raised China's to 125%. The key point here is whether Cambodia was included in the pause.\n\nLooking at [10], Deutsche Wealth's insight on April 10 confirms that the 90-day pause applies to all countries except China. The original reciprocal tariffs for countries like Vietnam and Cambodia were upwards of 45%, but with the pause, the rate is reduced to 10% during the 90 days. However, the article specifically mentions that China's rate is now 125%, but for others, the reciprocal tariffs are paused. So Cambodia's 49% reciprocal tariff would be paused, leaving only the 10% baseline. \n\nBut the user's query is about whether Trump took any action to lower, pause, delay, or remove tariffs specifically targeting Cambodia. The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs would mean that the additional 49% is paused, effectively reducing the total tariff from 59% (10% baseline + 49% reciprocal) to just 10%. However, the ancillary data specifies that only the removal of tariffs specifically targeting Cambodia counts. The 10% baseline is a general tariff on all imports, so pausing the reciprocal part (which was specific to Cambodia) would count as a pause on the Cambodia-specific tariff. \n\nTherefore, the 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs would qualify as a pause on the Cambodia-specific tariffs. Since this action was taken on April 10, within the April 30 deadline, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nI need to confirm that the pause applies to Cambodia. [10] mentions that the 90-day pause includes countries with reciprocal tariffs upwards of 45%, like Vietnam and Cambodia. Also, [11] states that the pause applies to nearly all US imports except China. Therefore, Cambodia's 49% reciprocal tariff is paused, meeting the resolution condition for \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9945, ID: 101328340782456375272899813811214790775175462992282140650885969266740617782912, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0055, ID: 43514972753641688359316113325039437722259377741478647697394486594331192641753, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744310746 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 18:45:46 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Cambodia by April 30, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's any federal legislation or executive action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Cambodia. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of tariffs on Cambodia. From the search results, especially [1], [2], and [8], it's clear that on April 2, 2025, Trump announced a 49% reciprocal tariff on Cambodia, which was part of his \"Liberation Day\" initiative. This was in addition to a 10% baseline tariff on all imports. The 49% rate was the highest among all countries, indicating Cambodia was hit hard.\n\nNow, looking for any updates or changes after April 2. Search result [3] from April 10 mentions that Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most countries but excluded China. However, the article also states that the steepest tariffs included 49% on Cambodia, 46% on Vietnam, etc. But then it says Canada was... (the rest is cut off). Wait, in [3], the Financial Post article from April 10 says Trump paused tariffs on most countries but raised China's to 125%. The key point here is whether Cambodia was included in the pause.\n\nLooking at [10], Deutsche Wealth's insight on April 10 confirms that the 90-day pause applies to all countries except China. The original reciprocal tariffs for countries like Vietnam and Cambodia were upwards of 45%, but with the pause, the rate is reduced to 10% during the 90 days. However, the article specifically mentions that China's rate is now 125%, but for others, the reciprocal tariffs are paused. So Cambodia's 49% reciprocal tariff would be paused, leaving only the 10% baseline. \n\nBut the user's query is about whether Trump took any action to lower, pause, delay, or remove tariffs specifically targeting Cambodia. The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs would mean that the additional 49% is paused, effectively reducing the total tariff from 59% (10% baseline + 49% reciprocal) to just 10%. However, the ancillary data specifies that only the removal of tariffs specifically targeting Cambodia counts. The 10% baseline is a general tariff on all imports, so pausing the reciprocal part (which was specific to Cambodia) would count as a pause on the Cambodia-specific tariff. \n\nTherefore, the 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs would qualify as a pause on the Cambodia-specific tariffs. Since this action was taken on April 10, within the April 30 deadline, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nI need to confirm that the pause applies to Cambodia. [10] mentions that the 90-day pause includes countries with reciprocal tariffs upwards of 45%, like Vietnam and Cambodia. Also, [11] states that the pause applies to nearly all US imports except China. Therefore, Cambodia's 49% reciprocal tariff is paused, meeting the resolution condition for \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9945, ID: 101328340782456375272899813811214790775175462992282140650885969266740617782912, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0055, ID: 43514972753641688359316113325039437722259377741478647697394486594331192641753, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744310746 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 18:45:46 UTC",
