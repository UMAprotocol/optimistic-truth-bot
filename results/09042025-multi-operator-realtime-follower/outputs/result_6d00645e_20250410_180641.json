If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

However, on April 9 (source 3) and April 10 (sources 2, 4, 8, 10, 13), there are reports that Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, including the 31% on Switzerland, replacing it with a 10% baseline tariff. This pause was announced via Truth Social and official statements.\n3. The Swiss president had a call with Trump (source 4), and a special envoy was appointed to handle negotiations (source 4). The pause gives Switzerland time to negotiate a deal.\n4. The 90-day pause means that the higher 31% tariff is delayed, and the 10% tariff remains. This is a specific action targeting Switzerland, as the reciprocal tariffs were country-specific.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that any action to lower, pause, delay, or remove tariffs on Switzerland counts. The pause on the 31% tariff (reducing it to 10% as part of the baseline) qualifies as a delay and reduction. Even though the 10% baseline remains, the key is that the higher 31% was paused.

The user wants to know if Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Switzerland before June 2025. The resolution conditions are based on any federal legislation or executive action by Trump that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Switzerland by May 31, 2025. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 10, 2025. The deadline is May 31, so there's about a month and a half left.

On April 2, Trump announced a 31% tariff on Swiss goods (sources 1, 5). This was part of his broader tariff plan.\n2. However, on April 9 (source 3) and April 10 (sources 2, 4, 8, 10, 13), there are reports that Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, including the 31% on Switzerland, replacing it with a 10% baseline tariff. This pause was announced via Truth Social and official statements.\n3. The Swiss president had a call with Trump (source 4), and a special envoy was appointed to handle negotiations (source 4). The pause gives Switzerland time to negotiate a deal.\n4. The 90-day pause means that the higher 31% tariff is delayed, and the 10% tariff remains. This is a specific action targeting Switzerland, as the reciprocal tariffs were country-specific.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that any action to lower, pause, delay, or remove tariffs on Switzerland counts.

The user wants to know if Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Switzerland before June 2025. The resolution conditions are based on any federal legislation or executive action by Trump that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Switzerland by May 31, 2025. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 10, 2025. The deadline is May 31, so there's about a month and a half left. The key here is to look at the provided search results to see if there's any action taken by Trump regarding Swiss tariffs.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. On April 2, Trump announced a 31% tariff on Swiss goods (sources 1, 5). This was part of his broader tariff plan.\n2. However, on April 9 (source 3) and April 10 (sources 2, 4, 8, 10, 13), there are reports that Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, including the 31% on Switzerland, replacing it with a 10% baseline tariff. This pause was announced via Truth Social and official statements.\n3. The Swiss president had a call with Trump (source 4), and a special envoy was appointed to handle negotiations (source 4). The pause gives Switzerland time to negotiate a deal.\n4. The 90-day pause means that the higher 31% tariff is delayed, and the 10% tariff remains. This is a specific action targeting Switzerland, as the reciprocal tariffs were country-specific.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that any action to lower, pause, delay, or remove tariffs on Switzerland counts. The pause on the 31% tariff (reducing it to 10% as part of the baseline) qualifies as a delay and reduction. Even though the 10% baseline remains, the key is that the higher 31% was paused. The resolution conditions mention that changes to reciprocal tariffs count, which this pause does.\n\nAdditionally, the sources (especially 3, 4, 8, 10) confirm that the pause was officially enacted within the timeframe (before May 31). The action was taken on April 9-10, which is within the market's time frame. The official sources from the Trump administration (Truth Social, White House statements) back this up.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Yes (p2) because Trump did pause the higher tariffs on Switzerland, which meets the resolution conditions.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.92, ID: 89423752631268083887453261782096647601987556494829936028369246870792916730062, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.08, ID: 87390411097498953516359177469476645267088843829336442501588174910613719834585, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.920 = 92.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744301102 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 16:05:02 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Switzerland before June 2025. The resolution conditions are based on any federal legislation or executive action by Trump that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Switzerland by May 31, 2025. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 10, 2025. The deadline is May 31, so there's about a month and a half left. The key here is to look at the provided search results to see if there's any action taken by Trump regarding Swiss tariffs.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. On April 2, Trump announced a 31% tariff on Swiss goods (sources 1, 5). This was part of his broader tariff plan.\n2. However, on April 9 (source 3) and April 10 (sources 2, 4, 8, 10, 13), there are reports that Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, including the 31% on Switzerland, replacing it with a 10% baseline tariff. This pause was announced via Truth Social and official statements.\n3. The Swiss president had a call with Trump (source 4), and a special envoy was appointed to handle negotiations (source 4). The pause gives Switzerland time to negotiate a deal.\n4. The 90-day pause means that the higher 31% tariff is delayed, and the 10% tariff remains. This is a specific action targeting Switzerland, as the reciprocal tariffs were country-specific.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that any action to lower, pause, delay, or remove tariffs on Switzerland counts. The pause on the 31% tariff (reducing it to 10% as part of the baseline) qualifies as a delay and reduction. Even though the 10% baseline remains, the key is that the higher 31% was paused. The resolution conditions mention that changes to reciprocal tariffs count, which this pause does.\n\nAdditionally, the sources (especially 3, 4, 8, 10) confirm that the pause was officially enacted within the timeframe (before May 31). The action was taken on April 9-10, which is within the market's time frame. The official sources from the Trump administration (Truth Social, White House statements) back this up.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Yes (p2) because Trump did pause the higher tariffs on Switzerland, which meets the resolution conditions.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.92, ID: 89423752631268083887453261782096647601987556494829936028369246870792916730062, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.08, ID: 87390411097498953516359177469476645267088843829336442501588174910613719834585, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.920 = 92.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744301102 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 16:05:02 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744301102 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 16:05:02 UTC"
