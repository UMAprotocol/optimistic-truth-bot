  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744236105 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-09 22:01:45 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Athletics vs. San Diego Padres game on April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if the Padres win, it's p1; if the Athletics win, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current timestamp is April 9, 2025, 10:03 PM UTC, which is the same day as the game. The game was scheduled for 3:35 PM ET, which converts to 19:35 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 in April). The current time is 22:03 UTC, so the game should have already occurred. \n\nNext, I check the search results for the game's outcome. Result [1] from ESPN mentions the Athletics won 10-4 on April 8, but that's a different date. Wait, the user's query is about April 9. Let me check the other results. \n\nLooking at [3], the Score.com page lists the game on April 9, 2025, with starting pitchers Randy V\u00e1squez and Osvaldo Bido. However, the search results don't provide the outcome of this specific game. Results [1], [2], [8], [9], [10], [12] all discuss the April 8 game where the Athletics won 10-4. The April 9 game isn't covered in the provided search results. \n\nWait, the user's ancillary data mentions the game is scheduled for April 9 at 3:35 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 9, 10:03 PM UTC, which is 6:03 PM ET. So the game was scheduled for 3:35 PM ET on April 9, which would have already started and likely concluded by the current time. However, none of the search results provide the outcome of the April 9 game. The latest result is from April 9, but they all refer to the April 8 game. \n\nThis is confusing. The user might have a typo in the date, but the ancillary data clearly states April 9. The search results include a CBS Sports page [2] that mentions the Padres looking to stay hot in the rematch on April 9, but the actual game data isn't present. The Score.com [3] lists the April 9 game but doesn't show the result. The other results [4], [6], [7], [11] also don't provide the April 9 outcome. \n\nSince the current date is April 9, 2025, and the game was scheduled for today, but the provided search results don't include the outcome, I need to determine if the game happened. If the game was played and the Athletics won, it's p2. If the Padres won, p1. If it was postponed or canceled, p3. \n\nHowever, the search results don't mention any postponement or cancellation. The absence of results might mean the game hasn't been reported yet, but given the current time, it's likely the game has concluded. Without explicit information, I can't confirm the outcome. According to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nLooking at the teams' performance: The Padres were 9-2 coming into April 9, while the Athletics were 4-7. The starting pitchers for April 9 were Randy V\u00e1squez (Padres) and Osvaldo Bido (Athletics). However, without game results, it's uncertain. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Padres have a better record, but the Athletics just won on April 8. However, without data, it's risky. \n\nWait, the user's personalization also states that if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. The game was at 3:35 PM ET, which is 19:35 UTC. The current time is 22:03 UTC, so the game should have started and ended. But without results, maybe it's still ongoing? Unlikely, as MLB games typically last around 3 hours. \n\nGiven the lack of data in the provided search results, and the instructions to resolve based on verifiable facts, I have to conclude that there's no information available. Therefore, according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Padres have a stronger record, but the Athletics just won the previous game. However, without data, the safest resolution is p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, default to p4. Wait, no: the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. If it can't be inferred, default to p4. \n\nSince there's no info, and we can't infer, the recommendation would be p4. But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. However, there's no info on cancellation. The user's instructions say if no info, and event date is past, assume most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The current timestamp is April 9, 2025, 10:03 PM UTC, which is the same day as the game. The game was scheduled for 3:35 PM ET, which converts to 19:35 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 in April). The current time is 22:03 UTC, so the game should have already occurred. \n\nNext, I check the search results for the game's outcome. Result [1] from ESPN mentions the Athletics won 10-4 on April 8, but that's a different date. Wait, the user's query is about April 9. Let me check the other results. \n\nLooking at [3], the Score.com page lists the game on April 9, 2025, with starting pitchers Randy V\u00e1squez and Osvaldo Bido. However, the search results don't provide the outcome of this specific game. Results [1], [2], [8], [9], [10], [12] all discuss the April 8 game where the Athletics won 10-4. The April 9 game isn't covered in the provided search results. \n\nWait, the user's ancillary data mentions the game is scheduled for April 9 at 3:35 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 9, 10:03 PM UTC, which is 6:03 PM ET. So the game was scheduled for 3:35 PM ET on April 9, which would have already started and likely concluded by the current time. However, none of the search results provide the outcome of the April 9 game. The latest result is from April 9, but they all refer to the April 8 game. \n\nThis is confusing. The user might have a typo in the date, but the ancillary data clearly states April 9. The search results include a CBS Sports page [2] that mentions the Padres looking to stay hot in the rematch on April 9, but the actual game data isn't present. The Score.com [3] lists the April 9 game but doesn't show the result. The other results [4], [6], [7], [11] also don't provide the April 9 outcome. \n\nSince the current date is April 9, 2025, and the game was scheduled for today, but the provided search results don't include the outcome, I need to determine if the game happened. If the game was played and the Athletics won, it's p2. If the Padres won, p1. If it was postponed or canceled, p3. \n\nHowever, the search results don't mention any postponement or cancellation. The absence of results might mean the game hasn't been reported yet, but given the current time, it's likely the game has concluded. Without explicit information, I can't confirm the outcome. According to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nLooking at the teams' performance: The Padres were 9-2 coming into April 9, while the Athletics were 4-7. The starting pitchers for April 9 were Randy V\u00e1squez (Padres) and Osvaldo Bido (Athletics). However, without game results, it's uncertain. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Padres have a better record, but the Athletics just won on April 8. However, without data, it's risky. \n\nWait, the user's personalization also states that if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. The game was at 3:35 PM ET, which is 19:35 UTC. The current time is 22:03 UTC, so the game should have started and ended. But without results, maybe it's still ongoing? Unlikely, as MLB games typically last around 3 hours. \n\nGiven the lack of data in the provided search results, and the instructions to resolve based on verifiable facts, I have to conclude that there's no information available. Therefore, according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Padres have a stronger record, but the Athletics just won the previous game. However, without data, the safest resolution is p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, default to p4. Wait, no: the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. If it can't be inferred, default to p4. \n\nSince there's no info, and we can't infer, the recommendation would be p4. But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. However, there's no info on cancellation. The user's instructions say if no info, and event date is past, assume most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744236105 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-09 22:01:45 UTC",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744236105 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-09 22:01:45 UTC"
