The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if any federal legislation or executive action lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs on Pakistan by May 31, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is April 10, 2025. The deadline is May 31, so we're looking at events between April 10 and May 31. But wait, the search results include information up to April 10, 2025. Let me review the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mix of information. The initial tariffs were announced on April 2, 2025, with a 29% tariff on Pakistan effective April 9. However, on April 9 (yesterday, given the current date is April 10), Trump announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs except China's. Sources [9], [10], [12], [13], and [14] mention this pause. Specifically, source [12] states that reciprocal tariffs above 10% were paused for 90 days for all countries except China. The baseline 10% tariff remains, but the additional reciprocal tariffs (like Pakistan's 29%) are paused. \n\nSource [11] is a YouTube video titled \"Trump's Surprise Gift for Pakistan | 90-Day Pause On Hefty Tariffs,\" which aligns with the text sources. The video's description mentions a 90-day pause on Pakistan's tariffs, offering relief. \n\nThe key point is whether the pause on the 29% reciprocal tariff qualifies as a \"pause\" under the resolution conditions. The ancillary data says any action that pauses tariffs counts. Since the 29% was an additional reciprocal tariff on top of the 10% baseline, pausing that would mean Pakistan's tariffs are reduced from 29% to 10%. However, the 10% baseline is still in effect. But the resolution condition specifies that only the removal of tariffs specifically targeting Pakistan counts. The 10% is a general tariff, so the pause of the additional 19% (29% total - 10% baseline) would be specific to Pakistan. \n\nWait, the initial announcement on April 2 (sources [1], [2], [4]) set a 29% tariff on Pakistan, which was part of the reciprocal tariffs. The April 9 pause (sources [9]-[14]) paused the reciprocal tariffs (the additional 19% in Pakistan's case), leaving the 10% baseline. Therefore, the action taken on April 9 effectively reduces the tariff on Pakistan from 29% to 10%, which is a reduction. However, the ancillary data says that lowering, pausing, delaying, or removing any tariffs counts. The pause on the reciprocal part (19%) would count as a reduction. \n\nBut the user's query is whether Trump will reduce or pause tariffs before June. The action happened on April 9, which is before the deadline of May 31. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). However, I need to confirm if the pause applies to Pakistan. The sources mention that the 90-day pause applies to all countries except China. Since Pakistan was part of the reciprocal tariffs, the pause would include them. \n\nSource [12] explicitly mentions that the reciprocal tariffs above 10% were paused for 90 days for all except China. Pakistan's 29% was a reciprocal tariff, so the pause would bring it down to 10%. This is a reduction, meeting the resolution condition.

The user is asking whether Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Pakistan before June 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if any federal legislation or executive action lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs on Pakistan by May 31, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is April 10, 2025. The deadline is May 31, so we're looking at events between April 10 and May 31. But wait, the search results include information up to April 10, 2025. Let me review the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mix of information. The initial tariffs were announced on April 2, 2025, with a 29% tariff on Pakistan effective April 9. However, on April 9 (yesterday, given the current date is April 10), Trump announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs except China's. Sources [9], [10], [12], [13], and [14] mention this pause. Specifically, source [12] states that reciprocal tariffs above 10% were paused for 90 days for all countries except China. The baseline 10% tariff remains, but the additional reciprocal tariffs (like Pakistan's 29%) are paused. \n\nSource [11] is a YouTube video titled \"Trump's Surprise Gift for Pakistan | 90-Day Pause On Hefty Tariffs,\" which aligns with the text sources. The video's description mentions a 90-day pause on Pakistan's tariffs, offering relief. \n\nThe key point is whether the pause on the 29% reciprocal tariff qualifies as a \"pause\" under the resolution conditions. The ancillary data says any action that pauses tariffs counts. Since the 29% was an additional reciprocal tariff on top of the 10% baseline, pausing that would mean Pakistan's tariffs are reduced from 29% to 10%. However, the 10% baseline is still in effect. But the resolution condition specifies that only the removal of tariffs specifically targeting Pakistan counts. The 10% is a general tariff, so the pause of the additional 19% (29% total - 10% baseline) would be specific to Pakistan. \n\nWait, the initial announcement on April 2 (sources [1], [2], [4]) set a 29% tariff on Pakistan, which was part of the reciprocal tariffs. The April 9 pause (sources [9]-[14]) paused the reciprocal tariffs (the additional 19% in Pakistan's case), leaving the 10% baseline. Therefore, the action taken on April 9 effectively reduces the tariff on Pakistan from 29% to 10%, which is a reduction. However, the ancillary data says that lowering, pausing, delaying, or removing any tariffs counts. The pause on the reciprocal part (19%) would count as a reduction. \n\nBut the user's query is whether Trump will reduce or pause tariffs before June. The action happened on April 9, which is before the deadline of May 31. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). However, I need to confirm if the pause applies to Pakistan. The sources mention that the 90-day pause applies to all countries except China. Since Pakistan was part of the reciprocal tariffs, the pause would include them. \n\nSource [12] explicitly mentions that the reciprocal tariffs above 10% were paused for 90 days for all except China. Pakistan's 29% was a reciprocal tariff, so the pause would bring it down to 10%. This is a reduction, meeting the resolution condition.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744300974 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 16:02:54 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Pakistan before June 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if any federal legislation or executive action lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs on Pakistan by May 31, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The provided timestamp is April 10, 2025. The deadline is May 31, so we're looking at events between April 10 and May 31. But wait, the search results include information up to April 10, 2025. Let me review the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mix of information. The initial tariffs were announced on April 2, 2025, with a 29% tariff on Pakistan effective April 9. However, on April 9 (yesterday, given the current date is April 10), Trump announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs except China's. Sources [9], [10], [12], [13], and [14] mention this pause. Specifically, source [12] states that reciprocal tariffs above 10% were paused for 90 days for all countries except China. The baseline 10% tariff remains, but the additional reciprocal tariffs (like Pakistan's 29%) are paused. \n\nSource [11] is a YouTube video titled \"Trump's Surprise Gift for Pakistan | 90-Day Pause On Hefty Tariffs,\" which aligns with the text sources. The video's description mentions a 90-day pause on Pakistan's tariffs, offering relief. \n\nThe key point is whether the pause on the 29% reciprocal tariff qualifies as a \"pause\" under the resolution conditions. The ancillary data says any action that pauses tariffs counts. Since the 29% was an additional reciprocal tariff on top of the 10% baseline, pausing that would mean Pakistan's tariffs are reduced from 29% to 10%. However, the 10% baseline is still in effect. But the resolution condition specifies that only the removal of tariffs specifically targeting Pakistan counts. The 10% is a general tariff, so the pause of the additional 19% (29% total - 10% baseline) would be specific to Pakistan. \n\nWait, the initial announcement on April 2 (sources [1], [2], [4]) set a 29% tariff on Pakistan, which was part of the reciprocal tariffs. The April 9 pause (sources [9]-[14]) paused the reciprocal tariffs (the additional 19% in Pakistan's case), leaving the 10% baseline. Therefore, the action taken on April 9 effectively reduces the tariff on Pakistan from 29% to 10%, which is a reduction. However, the ancillary data says that lowering, pausing, delaying, or removing any tariffs counts. The pause on the reciprocal part (19%) would count as a reduction. \n\nBut the user's query is whether Trump will reduce or pause tariffs before June. The action happened on April 9, which is before the deadline of May 31. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). However, I need to confirm if the pause applies to Pakistan. The sources mention that the 90-day pause applies to all countries except China. Since Pakistan was part of the reciprocal tariffs, the pause would include them. \n\nSource [12] explicitly mentions that the reciprocal tariffs above 10% were paused for 90 days for all except China. Pakistan's 29% was a reciprocal tariff, so the pause would bring it down to 10%. This is a reduction, meeting the resolution condition. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.8, ID: 40756105305894337060406347675454544061282197108091037320390818955487271880078, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.2, ID: 73690368678315793674576134279847274315806997416671063074957777016385781270707, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors YES outcome (0.800 = 80.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.
