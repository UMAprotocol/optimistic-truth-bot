See: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/03/trumps-tariffs-the-full-list.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump or his administration officially announces a pause, delay, or removal of all country specific reciprocal tariffs other than those placed on China by April 9, 12:00 AM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny announcement within this market's time frame will qualify regardless of if/when the policy goes into effect.\n\nAn announcement of a pause, delay, or removal of all country specific reciprocal tariffs including China will qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nThis market's primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration; however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744254726 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 03:12:06 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the Trump administration paused all reciprocal tariffs except those on China before the deadline of April 9, 12:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if such an announcement was made by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each source to find relevant information about the tariffs and any announcements of a pause. \n\nLooking at source [1], it mentions that Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for many countries but raised China's to 125%. The date here is April 9, 2025. The announcement was made on Truth Social, which is an official channel. This seems to indicate a pause on most tariffs except China's, which aligns with the query's conditions.\n\nSource [2] from Politico also states that Trump paused new tariffs on all nations except China, effective April 9. This directly supports the \"Yes\" resolution. The article mentions the 90-day suspension and the increase on China, which fits the user's query.\n\nSource [4] from CBS News confirms the 90-day pause and the 10% reciprocal tariff, except for China, which is increased to 125%. The announcement was made on April 10, but the effective date is immediate. Wait, the deadline was April 9 at 12:00 AM ET. The announcement was made on April 9 according to the article's date, but the timestamp in the search result says 2025-04-10. Hmm, need to check the time zones. The user's deadline is April 9, 12:00 AM ET. If the announcement was made on April 9, even if the article is dated April 10, it might still be within the deadline. However, the exact time of the announcement is crucial. \n\nLooking at source [6], it mentions that the reciprocal tariffs went into effect on April 9 at 12:01 AM, but Trump announced the pause on April 9, which would be after the deadline. Wait, the deadline is April 9 at 12:00 AM ET, so any announcement after that time would be past the deadline. But the query says \"before April 9, 12:00 AM ET\". Wait, the user's query says the deadline is April 9, 12:00 AM ET. The reciprocal tariffs were scheduled to go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 AM. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the pause was announced before that time. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [3] from CBS News on April 9 says the reciprocal tariffs went into effect at 12:01 AM on April 9. Then, source [4] from CBS News on April 10 says Trump announced the pause on April 9, but after the tariffs had already taken effect. However, the user's query allows any announcement within the market's time frame, regardless of when the policy goes into effect. The key is whether the announcement was made by the deadline. \n\nWait, the market's time frame is until April 9, 12:00 AM ET. If the announcement was made after that time, it wouldn't count. But according to source [1], the announcement was on April 9, but the exact time isn't specified. Source [4] mentions the announcement was made on April 9, and the stock market reacted immediately. The article's timestamp is April 10, which could be due to time zone differences. For example, if the announcement was made in the afternoon of April 9 ET, that would be after the deadline of 12:00 AM ET on April 9. Therefore, the announcement would be after the deadline, making the resolution \"No\". But the user's query says \"Any announcement within this market's time frame will qualify regardless of if/when the policy goes into effect.\" Wait, the market's time frame is until April 9, 12:00 AM ET. So the announcement needs to be made by that time. If Trump announced the pause after the deadline, it wouldn't count. \n\nBut looking at source [7], which is a White House document dated April 2, 2025, it's about the initial announcement of tariffs. Source [8] from Financial Post on April 10 says Trump announced the pause on April 9, but again, the timing is unclear. \n\nWait, the user's query states that the reciprocal tariffs were scheduled to go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 AM ET. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the pause was announced before April 9, 12:00 AM ET. So the cutoff is midnight on April 9. If Trump announced the pause on April 9 but after midnight, that's too late. However, according to source [4], the announcement was made on April 9, but the article is dated April 10. This could mean the announcement was made on April 9 in ET, but after the deadline. \n\nHowever, source [1] is dated April 9, 2025, and mentions the announcement on that day. The exact time of the announcement isn't specified, but the article was published on April 9 at 22:15, which is 10:15 PM ET. If the announcement was made on April 9, but after the deadline of 12:00 AM ET, that would be a problem. Wait, April 9 at 12:00 AM ET is the very start of the day. So any announcement on April 9 would be after the deadline. Therefore, the pause announced on April 9 would be too late, and the market should resolve to \"No\". \n\nBut the user's query says \"Any announcement within this market's time frame will qualify regardless of if/when the policy goes into effect.\" The market's time frame is until April 9, 12:00 AM ET. So the announcement must be made by that time. If Trump announced the pause on April 9, even a minute after midnight, it's outside the time frame. \n\nHowever, looking at the search results, the reciprocal tariffs were set to go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 AM. The announcement to pause them was made on April 9, but after the deadline. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\". But the sources indicate that the announcement was made on April 9, which is after the deadline. \n\nWait, the user's query might have a typo. The deadline is April 9, 12:00 AM ET, which is midnight between April 8 and April 9. If the announcement was made on April 9, even at 12:01 AM, it's after the deadline. However, the search results mention that the tariffs went into effect on April 9 at 12:01 AM, and the pause was announced on April 9. Therefore, the pause was announced after the deadline, so the resolution should be \"No\". \n\nBut the ancillary data says that any announcement within the market's time frame qualifies, regardless of when the policy goes into effect. The market's time frame is until April 9, 12:00 AM ET. So the announcement must be made by that time. If the announcement was made after that, even on April 9, it's outside the time frame. \n\nHowever, according to the search results, the announcement was made on April 9, which is after the deadline. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\". But the user's query might have conflicting information. Wait, the query's description says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the pause is announced by April 9, 12:00 AM ET. The sources indicate the announcement was made on April 9, but the exact time isn't clear. If the announcement was made on April 9 at, say, 9 AM ET, that's after the deadline. Therefore, the answer would be \"No\". \n\nBut looking at source [4], the article is dated April 10, but the announcement was made on April 9. The timestamp in the search results is 2025-04-10, but the article says \"President Trump on Wednesday announced...\" which would be April 9. So the announcement was made on April 9, but after the deadline of midnight. Therefore, the resolution is \"No\". \n\nHowever, the user's query allows for a consensus of credible reporting. If multiple sources report that the announcement was made on April 9, even after the deadline, but the market's time frame is until April 9 at 12:00 AM, then the answer is \"No\". \n\nBut wait, the user's query says \"Any announcement within this market's time frame will qualify regardless of if/when the policy goes into effect.\" The time frame is until April 9, 12:00 AM ET. So the announcement must be made by that time. If the announcement was made after that, it doesn't qualify. \n\nGiven that the sources all indicate the announcement was made on April 9, which is after the deadline, the resolution should be \"No\". However, the user might have intended the deadline to be the end of April 9, but the query explicitly states 12:00 AM ET on April 9. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, the announcement was made after the deadline, so the resolution is \"No\" (p1). But wait, the search results mention that the pause was announced on April 9, but the exact time isn't specified. If the announcement was made before midnight on April 9, it would be within the time frame. However, April 9 at 12:00 AM ET is the very start of the day, so any time on April 9 is after the deadline. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is \"No\" (p1). However, the sources indicate that the administration did announce a pause on all reciprocal tariffs except China's, but the timing is after the deadline. Hence, the answer is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

See: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/03/trumps-tariffs-the-full-list.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump or his administration officially announces a pause, delay, or removal of all country specific reciprocal tariffs other than those placed on China by April 9, 12:00 AM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny announcement within this market's time frame will qualify regardless of if/when the policy goes into effect.\n\nAn announcement of a pause, delay, or removal of all country specific reciprocal tariffs including China will qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nThis market's primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration; however, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
