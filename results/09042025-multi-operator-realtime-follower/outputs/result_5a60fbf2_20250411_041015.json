Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n"

The key here is to verify the actual result of the game based on the provided search results and current timestamp.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is April 11, 2025, 4:09:52 AM UTC. The game was scheduled for April 10 at 9:30 PM ET, which is April 11 at 1:30 AM UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, the event has already occurred. So, I don't need to consider p4 (future event) anymore.\n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A prediction article from April 10 mentions the Timberwolves have a 58% chance to win, but it's a prediction, not the actual result.\n2. **Source [2]**: TheScore.com lists the game on April 11, 2025, but doesn't show the score. It just has player stats, which might be pre-game info.\n3. **Source [3]**: Covers.com's prediction from April 10 also discusses the under bet but doesn't report the result.\n4. **Source [4]**: Action Network's page doesn't show the final score, only pre-game odds and trends.\n5. **Source [5]**: SI.com's injury report from April 10 talks about the game's importance but no result.\n6. **Source [6]**: CBS Sports' preview from April 10 includes predictions but no score.\n7. **Source [7]**: Livescores.biz lists the game on April 10 but doesn't show the result. The latest results for both teams are from earlier dates.\n8. **Source [8]**: Another CBS Sports article from April 9 previews the game but no outcome.\n9. **Source [9]**: Action Network's prediction from April 11 mentions the Timberwolves' first-half performance but not the final result.\n10. **Source [10]**: Sportskeeda's player stats from April 11 show the Timberwolves leading in the first quarter but not the final score.\n11. **Source [11]**: Another CBS Sports preview without the result.\n12. **Source [12]**: YouTube highlights of the 1st quarter, indicating the game was played but not the final outcome.\n13. **Source [13]**: NBC Sports' preview from April 10, no result.\n14. **Source [14]**: YouTube highlights of the 3rd quarter, showing the Timberwolves leading but not the end.\n15. **Source [15]**: Stats Insider's prediction from April 10 projects a Timberwolves win 116-114, but it's a prediction.\n16. **Source [16]**: Dimers.com's prediction also has Timberwolves 116-115, still a prediction.\n\nNone of the sources provide the actual final score of the game. However, sources [12] and [14] are YouTube highlights from the 1st and 3rd quarters, confirming the game took place. Since the event date is in the past and there's no report of cancellation or postponement, I must infer the most probable outcome based on the ancillary data. The ancillary data states that if the game is canceled, it resolves 50-50 (p3), but since the game was played, we need to determine the winner.\n\nGiven the predictions from sources [1], [15], and [16] all favor the Timberwolves, and the absence of any sources reporting a Grizzlies win, the most probable outcome based on the conditions is a Timberwolves victory. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Timberwolves).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Memphis Grizzlies on April 10, 2025. The key here is to verify the actual result of the game based on the provided search results and current timestamp.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is April 11, 2025, 4:09:52 AM UTC. The game was scheduled for April 10 at 9:30 PM ET, which is April 11 at 1:30 AM UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, the event has already occurred. So, I don't need to consider p4 (future event) anymore.\n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A prediction article from April 10 mentions the Timberwolves have a 58% chance to win, but it's a prediction, not the actual result.\n2. **Source [2]**: TheScore.com lists the game on April 11, 2025, but doesn't show the score. It just has player stats, which might be pre-game info.\n3. **Source [3]**: Covers.com's prediction from April 10 also discusses the under bet but doesn't report the result.\n4. **Source [4]**: Action Network's page doesn't show the final score, only pre-game odds and trends.\n5. **Source [5]**: SI.com's injury report from April 10 talks about the game's importance but no result.\n6. **Source [6]**: CBS Sports' preview from April 10 includes predictions but no score.\n7. **Source [7]**: Livescores.biz lists the game on April 10 but doesn't show the result. The latest results for both teams are from earlier dates.\n8. **Source [8]**: Another CBS Sports article from April 9 previews the game but no outcome.\n9. **Source [9]**: Action Network's prediction from April 11 mentions the Timberwolves' first-half performance but not the final result.\n10. **Source [10]**: Sportskeeda's player stats from April 11 show the Timberwolves leading in the first quarter but not the final score.\n11. **Source [11]**: Another CBS Sports preview without the result.\n12. **Source [12]**: YouTube highlights of the 1st quarter, indicating the game was played but not the final outcome.\n13. **Source [13]**: NBC Sports' preview from April 10, no result.\n14. **Source [14]**: YouTube highlights of the 3rd quarter, showing the Timberwolves leading but not the end.\n15. **Source [15]**: Stats Insider's prediction from April 10 projects a Timberwolves win 116-114, but it's a prediction.\n16. **Source [16]**: Dimers.com's prediction also has Timberwolves 116-115, still a prediction.\n\nNone of the sources provide the actual final score of the game. However, sources [12] and [14] are YouTube highlights from the 1st and 3rd quarters, confirming the game took place. Since the event date is in the past and there's no report of cancellation or postponement, I must infer the most probable outcome based on the ancillary data. The ancillary data states that if the game is canceled, it resolves 50-50 (p3), but since the game was played, we need to determine the winner.\n\nGiven the predictions from sources [1], [15], and [16] all favor the Timberwolves, and the absence of any sources reporting a Grizzlies win, the most probable outcome based on the conditions is a Timberwolves victory.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Memphis Grizzlies on April 10, 2025. The key here is to verify the actual result of the game based on the provided search results and current timestamp.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is April 11, 2025, 4:09:52 AM UTC. The game was scheduled for April 10 at 9:30 PM ET, which is April 11 at 1:30 AM UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, the event has already occurred. So, I don't need to consider p4 (future event) anymore.\n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A prediction article from April 10 mentions the Timberwolves have a 58% chance to win, but it's a prediction, not the actual result.\n2. **Source [2]**: TheScore.com lists the game on April 11, 2025, but doesn't show the score. It just has player stats, which might be pre-game info.\n3. **Source [3]**: Covers.com's prediction from April 10 also discusses the under bet but doesn't report the result.\n4. **Source [4]**: Action Network's page doesn't show the final score, only pre-game odds and trends.\n5. **Source [5]**: SI.com's injury report from April 10 talks about the game's importance but no result.\n6. **Source [6]**: CBS Sports' preview from April 10 includes predictions but no score.\n7. **Source [7]**: Livescores.biz lists the game on April 10 but doesn't show the result. The latest results for both teams are from earlier dates.\n8. **Source [8]**: Another CBS Sports article from April 9 previews the game but no outcome.\n9. **Source [9]**: Action Network's prediction from April 11 mentions the Timberwolves' first-half performance but not the final result.\n10. **Source [10]**: Sportskeeda's player stats from April 11 show the Timberwolves leading in the first quarter but not the final score.\n11. **Source [11]**: Another CBS Sports preview without the result.\n12. **Source [12]**: YouTube highlights of the 1st quarter, indicating the game was played but not the final outcome.\n13. **Source [13]**: NBC Sports' preview from April 10, no result.\n14. **Source [14]**: YouTube highlights of the 3rd quarter, showing the Timberwolves leading but not the end.\n15. **Source [15]**: Stats Insider's prediction from April 10 projects a Timberwolves win 116-114, but it's a prediction.\n16. **Source [16]**: Dimers.com's prediction also has Timberwolves 116-115, still a prediction.\n\nNone of the sources provide the actual final score of the game. However, sources [12] and [14] are YouTube highlights from the 1st and 3rd quarters, confirming the game took place. Since the event date is in the past and there's no report of cancellation or postponement, I must infer the most probable outcome based on the ancillary data. The ancillary data states that if the game is canceled, it resolves 50-50 (p3), but since the game was played, we need to determine the winner.\n\nGiven the predictions from sources [1], [15], and [16] all favor the Timberwolves, and the absence of any sources reporting a Grizzlies win, the most probable outcome based on the conditions is a Timberwolves victory.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Timberwolves, Price: 0.9995, ID: 40867592783173572124110743531577497118526831358779159866938881599457078670437, Winner: No\n- Token: Grizzlies, Price: 0.0005, ID: 1498286475840612021738780275409834649854797022218787671178353291121670447205, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Timberwolves outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\np4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Timberwolves, Price: 0.9995, ID: 40867592783173572124110743531577497118526831358779159866938881599457078670437, Winner: No\n- Token: Grizzlies, Price: 0.0005, ID: 1498286475840612021738780275409834649854797022218787671178353291121670447205, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Timberwolves outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

Where p1 corresponds to Grizzlies, p2 to Timberwolves, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744344224 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 04:03:44 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"
