If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Buffalo Sabres vs. Columbus Blue Jackets game on April 10, 2025. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened. I need to determine the result of that game to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. The key sources here are the game previews, recaps, and any post-game reports. Let's go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at source [2], it's a preview from the Sabres' official site dated April 10, 2025. It mentions the Sabres are on a five-game winning streak and their recent form. However, this is a preview, so it doesn't have the result.\n\nSource [9] from Fox Sports provides a box score link, but the content shown is a placeholder without the actual result. Similarly, source [10] on NHL.com has a video titled \"Dahlin | Goal at CBJ | Buffalo Sabres\" from April 10, 2025. The description mentions Rasmus Dahlin scoring a goal, and other videos like \"JJ Peterka opens the scoring\" and \"FINAL | Sabres 3 - Hurricanes 0\". Wait, that last one might be a different game against the Hurricanes. Need to check dates. The video in [10] is from April 10, 2025, and includes a final score of Sabres 3 - Hurricanes 0, but that's their previous game. The Dahlin goal video is from the game against CBJ, but the final score isn't clear here.\n\nSource [8] is a YouTube video of gameplay between the Blue Jackets and Sabres. The transcript mentions Buffalo scoring into an empty net to seal the deal, implying a Sabres win. The transcript says, \"scores into the empty net and that should probably wrap this one up... the insurance marker... Sabres 3 - Blue Jackets 1?\" Wait, the exact score isn't clear, but the empty net goal suggests Buffalo won.\n\nSource [12] is a prediction article from April 10, but it's a preview. However, source [13] from Dimers.com, updated after the game, states their model predicted Blue Jackets to win, but the actual result might differ. Wait, no\u2014source [13] is a prediction dated April 10, so it's not post-game. Similarly, other sources like [3], [4], [6], [7], [11], [14], [15], [16] are all previews or predictions before the game.\n\nWait, source [10] has a video titled \"FINAL | Sabres 3 - Hurricanes 0\" which is their previous game. The Dahlin goal video is from the CBJ game, but the description doesn't give the final score. However, source [8]'s YouTube transcript describes the Sabres scoring an empty-net goal to secure the win. The transcript mentions \"scores into the empty net and that should probably wrap this one up... Sabres game control...\" which implies the Sabres won. The exact score isn't stated, but an empty-net goal typically happens when the opposing team pulls their goalie, leading to a 2-goal lead. So if it was 3-1 or similar.\n\nLooking at source [9] again, the Fox Sports page lists the Sabres' leading scorers and team stats, but the actual game result isn't shown in the provided content. However, source [10]'s video titles include \"Rasmus Dahlin gives the Sabres a 2-0 lead\" and \"JJ Peterka opens the scoring\", which suggests the Sabres were leading during the game. The final result isn't explicitly mentioned, but the empty-net goal in source [8] indicates a Sabres victory.\n\nAdditionally, source [2] mentions the Sabres were on a five-game winning streak and looking to extend it. If they won against CBJ, that would make it six straight. Since the current date is April 11, the game happened on April 10, and the available evidence points to a Sabres win, especially with the empty-net goal described in the YouTube transcript.\n\nTherefore, based on the search results, particularly the YouTube gameplay transcript indicating a Sabres win with an empty-net goal, the market should resolve to \"Sabres\", which corresponds to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Buffalo Sabres vs. Columbus Blue Jackets game on April 10, 2025. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened. I need to determine the result of that game to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. The key sources here are the game previews, recaps, and any post-game reports. Let's go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at source [2], it's a preview from the Sabres' official site dated April 10, 2025. It mentions the Sabres are on a five-game winning streak and their recent form. However, this is a preview, so it doesn't have the result.\n\nSource [9] from Fox Sports provides a box score link, but the content shown is a placeholder without the actual result. Similarly, source [10] on NHL.com has a video titled \"Dahlin | Goal at CBJ | Buffalo Sabres\" from April 10, 2025. The description mentions Rasmus Dahlin scoring a goal, and other videos like \"JJ Peterka opens the scoring\" and \"FINAL | Sabres 3 - Hurricanes 0\". Wait, that last one might be a different game against the Hurricanes. Need to check dates. The video in [10] is from April 10, 2025, and includes a final score of Sabres 3 - Hurricanes 0, but that's their previous game. The Dahlin goal video is from the game against CBJ, but the final score isn't clear here.\n\nSource [8] is a YouTube video of gameplay between the Blue Jackets and Sabres. The transcript mentions Buffalo scoring into an empty net to seal the deal, implying a Sabres win. The transcript says, \"scores into the empty net and that should probably wrap this one up... the insurance marker... Sabres 3 - Blue Jackets 1?\" Wait, the exact score isn't clear, but the empty net goal suggests Buffalo won.\n\nSource [12] is a prediction article from April 10, but it's a preview. However, source [13] from Dimers.com, updated after the game, states their model predicted Blue Jackets to win, but the actual result might differ. Wait, no\u2014source [13] is a prediction dated April 10, so it's not post-game. Similarly, other sources like [3], [4], [6], [7], [11], [14], [15], [16] are all previews or predictions before the game.\n\nWait, source [10] has a video titled \"FINAL | Sabres 3 - Hurricanes 0\" which is their previous game. The Dahlin goal video is from the CBJ game, but the description doesn't give the final score. However, source [8]'s YouTube transcript describes the Sabres scoring an empty-net goal to secure the win. The transcript mentions \"scores into the empty net and that should probably wrap this one up... Sabres game control...\" which implies the Sabres won. The exact score isn't stated, but an empty-net goal typically happens when the opposing team pulls their goalie, leading to a 2-goal lead. So if it was 3-1 or similar.\n\nLooking at source [9] again, the Fox Sports page lists the Sabres' leading scorers and team stats, but the actual game result isn't shown in the provided content. However, source [10]'s video titles include \"Rasmus Dahlin gives the Sabres a 2-0 lead\" and \"JJ Peterka opens the scoring\", which suggests the Sabres were leading during the game. The final result isn't explicitly mentioned, but the empty-net goal in source [8] indicates a Sabres victory.\n\nAdditionally, source [2] mentions the Sabres were on a five-game winning streak and looking to extend it. If they won against CBJ, that would make it six straight. Since the current date is April 11, the game happened on April 10, and the available evidence points to a Sabres win, especially with the empty-net goal described in the YouTube transcript.\n\nTherefore, based on the search results, particularly the YouTube gameplay transcript indicating a Sabres win with an empty-net goal, the market should resolve to \"Sabres\", which corresponds to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Sabres, Price: 0.06, ID: 113670935901701097338346604143903056026600443621112619736525682170710511719915, Winner: No\n- Token: Blue Jackets, Price: 0.94, ID: 90295147946860397896404219770065560935720900405543410738255289740162910514170, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Blue Jackets outcome (0.940 = 94.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Since the current date is April 11, the game happened on April 10, and the available evidence points to a Sabres win, especially with the empty-net goal described in the YouTube transcript.\n\nTherefore, based on the search results, particularly the YouTube gameplay transcript indicating a Sabres win with an empty-net goal, the market should resolve to \"Sabres\", which corresponds to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Sabres, Price: 0.06, ID: 113670935901701097338346604143903056026600443621112619736525682170710511719915, Winner: No\n- Token: Blue Jackets, Price: 0.94, ID: 90295147946860397896404219770065560935720900405543410738255289740162910514170, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Blue Jackets outcome (0.940 = 94.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744335815 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 01:43:35 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Buffalo Sabres vs. Columbus Blue Jackets game on April 10, 2025. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened. I need to determine the result of that game to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. The key sources here are the game previews, recaps, and any post-game reports. Let's go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at source [2], it's a preview from the Sabres' official site dated April 10, 2025. It mentions the Sabres are on a five-game winning streak and their recent form. However, this is a preview, so it doesn't have the result.\n\nSource [9] from Fox Sports provides a box score link, but the content shown is a placeholder without the actual result. Similarly, source [10] on NHL.com has a video titled \"Dahlin | Goal at CBJ | Buffalo Sabres\" from April 10, 2025. The description mentions Rasmus Dahlin scoring a goal, and other videos like \"JJ Peterka opens the scoring\" and \"FINAL | Sabres 3 - Hurricanes 0\". Wait, that last one might be a different game against the Hurricanes. Need to check dates. The video in [10] is from April 10, 2025, and includes a final score of Sabres 3 - Hurricanes 0, but that's their previous game. The Dahlin goal video is from the game against CBJ, but the final score isn't clear here.\n\nSource [8] is a YouTube video of gameplay between the Blue Jackets and Sabres. The transcript mentions Buffalo scoring into an empty net to seal the deal, implying a Sabres win. The transcript says, \"scores into the empty net and that should probably wrap this one up... the insurance marker... Sabres 3 - Blue Jackets 1?\" Wait, the exact score isn't clear, but the empty net goal suggests Buffalo won.\n\nSource [12] is a prediction article from April 10, but it's a preview. However, source [13] from Dimers.com, updated after the game, states their model predicted Blue Jackets to win, but the actual result might differ. Wait, no\u2014source [13] is a prediction dated April 10, so it's not post-game. Similarly, other sources like [3], [4], [6], [7], [11], [14], [15], [16] are all previews or predictions before the game.\n\nWait, source [10] has a video titled \"FINAL | Sabres 3 - Hurricanes 0\" which is their previous game. The Dahlin goal video is from the CBJ game, but the description doesn't give the final score. However, source [8]'s YouTube transcript describes the Sabres scoring an empty-net goal to secure the win. The transcript mentions \"scores into the empty net and that should probably wrap this one up... Sabres game control...\" which implies the Sabres won. The exact score isn't stated, but an empty-net goal typically happens when the opposing team pulls their goalie, leading to a 2-goal lead. So if it was 3-1 or similar.\n\nLooking at source [9] again, the Fox Sports page lists the Sabres' leading scorers and team stats, but the actual game result isn't shown in the provided content. However, source [10]'s video titles include \"Rasmus Dahlin gives the Sabres a 2-0 lead\" and \"JJ Peterka opens the scoring\", which suggests the Sabres were leading during the game. The final result isn't explicitly mentioned, but the empty-net goal in source [8] indicates a Sabres victory.\n\nAdditionally, source [2] mentions the Sabres were on a five-game winning streak and looking to extend it. If they won against CBJ, that would make it six straight. Since the current date is April 11, the game happened on April 10, and the available evidence points to a Sabres win, especially with the empty-net goal described in the YouTube transcript.\n\nTherefore, based on the search results, particularly the YouTube gameplay transcript indicating a Sabres win with an empty-net goal, the market should resolve to \"Sabres\", which corresponds to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Sabres, Price: 0.06, ID: 113670935901701097338346604143903056026600443621112619736525682170710511719915, Winner: No\n- Token: Blue Jackets, Price: 0.94, ID: 90295147946860397896404219770065560935720900405543410738255289740162910514170, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Blue Jackets outcome (0.940 = 94.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744335815 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 01:43:35 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt.

Consider the strong market sentiment in favor of the Blue Jackets in the analysis."
