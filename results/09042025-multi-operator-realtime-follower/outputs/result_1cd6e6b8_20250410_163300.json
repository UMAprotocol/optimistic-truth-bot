For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n"

The resolution depends on comparing the closing prices of the 1-minute candles at those specific times.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 10, 2025, 16:26:56 UTC. Since ET is UTC-4, noon ET on April 10th would be 16:00 UTC. The current time is 16:26 UTC, which is after the 10th's noon ET. So the event has already occurred, and I need to verify the closing prices for both days.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [4] mentions that on April 9th at 11:06 AM UTC, BTC dropped below 76,000 USDT to 75,979.1875. However, the query specifies noon ET, which is 16:00 UTC. So I need the exact 1-minute candle close at 16:00 UTC on April 9th. The data in [4] is from 11:06 AM UTC, which is earlier, so not directly relevant.\n\nResult [12] from Coinalyze shows a live price chart. At 12:50:41 UTC on April 10th, the price was around 82,635 USDT. But this is before the 16:00 UTC cutoff. The 24-hour data shows a high of 84,720 and a low of 81,211.24, but again, not the specific time.\n\nResult [13] from CoinGecko lists the BTCUSDT futures price as $83,637.52, but this is a recent snapshot, not the specific 1-minute close. The Binance API data in [8] might have historical candles, but the provided data doesn't include the exact times needed.\n\nThe user specified that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1-minute candles. Since the current time is past the event, I should check if the closing prices are available in the provided data. However, the search results don't include the exact 1-minute closes at 16:00 UTC on both days. \n\nGiven that the event date is in the past and no verifiable information on the exact closing prices is provided, I have to infer based on available data. The ancillary data says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The market resolves to Up if April 10th's close is higher than April 9th's. \n\nLooking at the general trend: On April 9th, BTC was around 75k-80k, and on April 10th, the price in [12] shows a 24-hour high of 84,720, suggesting an upward movement. However, without the exact closes, there's uncertainty. But since the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no info, and given the price increased from the 9th's lower prices to the 10th's higher, it's likely Up.

The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price on Binance's BTCUSDT pair went up or down between April 9th and April 10th at noon ET. The resolution depends on comparing the closing prices of the 1-minute candles at those specific times.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 10, 2025, 16:26:56 UTC. Since ET is UTC-4, noon ET on April 10th would be 16:00 UTC. The current time is 16:26 UTC, which is after the 10th's noon ET. So the event has already occurred, and I need to verify the closing prices for both days.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [4] mentions that on April 9th at 11:06 AM UTC, BTC dropped below 76,000 USDT to 75,979.1875. However, the query specifies noon ET, which is 16:00 UTC. So I need the exact 1-minute candle close at 16:00 UTC on April 9th. The data in [4] is from 11:06 AM UTC, which is earlier, so not directly relevant.\n\nResult [12] from Coinalyze shows a live price chart. At 12:50:41 UTC on April 10th, the price was around 82,635 USDT. But this is before the 16:00 UTC cutoff. The 24-hour data shows a high of 84,720 and a low of 81,211.24, but again, not the specific time.\n\nResult [13] from CoinGecko lists the BTCUSDT futures price as $83,637.52, but this is a recent snapshot, not the specific 1-minute close. The Binance API data in [8] might have historical candles, but the provided data doesn't include the exact times needed.\n\nThe user specified that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1-minute candles. Since the current time is past the event, I should check if the closing prices are available in the provided data. However, the search results don't include the exact 1-minute closes at 16:00 UTC on both days. \n\nGiven that the event date is in the past and no verifiable information on the exact closing prices is provided, I have to infer based on available data. The ancillary data says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The market resolves to Up if April 10th's close is higher than April 9th's. \n\nLooking at the general trend: On April 9th, BTC was around 75k-80k, and on April 10th, the price in [12] shows a 24-hour high of 84,720, suggesting an upward movement. However, without the exact closes, there's uncertainty. But since the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no info, and given the price increased from the 9th's lower prices to the 10th's higher, it's likely Up. So recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.997, ID: 109467672044785126967497957678921064461418434884409215314014156363003909804756, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.003, ID: 63967661451667887671118198503921430425455780439363987452632658646741868996176, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (0.997 = 99.7% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price on Binance's BTCUSDT pair went up or down between April 9th and April 10th at noon ET. The resolution depends on comparing the closing prices of the 1-minute candles at those specific times.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 10, 2025, 16:26:56 UTC. Since ET is UTC-4, noon ET on April 10th would be 16:00 UTC. The current time is 16:26 UTC, which is after the 10th's noon ET. So the event has already occurred, and I need to verify the closing prices for both days.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [4] mentions that on April 9th at 11:06 AM UTC, BTC dropped below 76,000 USDT to 75,979.1875. However, the query specifies noon ET, which is 16:00 UTC. So I need the exact 1-minute candle close at 16:00 UTC on April 9th. The data in [4] is from 11:06 AM UTC, which is earlier, so not directly relevant.\n\nResult [12] from Coinalyze shows a live price chart. At 12:50:41 UTC on April 10th, the price was around 82,635 USDT. But this is before the 16:00 UTC cutoff. The 24-hour data shows a high of 84,720 and a low of 81,211.24, but again, not the specific time.\n\nResult [13] from CoinGecko lists the BTCUSDT futures price as $83,637.52, but this is a recent snapshot, not the specific 1-minute close. The Binance API data in [8] might have historical candles, but the provided data doesn't include the exact times needed.\n\nThe user specified that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1-minute candles. Since the current time is past the event, I should check if the closing prices are available in the provided data. However, the search results don't include the exact 1-minute closes at 16:00 UTC on both days. \n\nGiven that the event date is in the past and no verifiable information on the exact closing prices is provided, I have to infer based on available data. The ancillary data says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The market resolves to Up if April 10th's close is higher than April 9th's. \n\nLooking at the general trend: On April 9th, BTC was around 75k-80k, and on April 10th, the price in [12] shows a 24-hour high of 84,720, suggesting an upward movement. However, without the exact closes, there's uncertainty. But since the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no info, and given the price increased from the 9th's lower prices to the 10th's higher, it's likely Up. So recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.997, ID: 109467672044785126967497957678921064461418434884409215314014156363003909804756, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.003, ID: 63967661451667887671118198503921430425455780439363987452632658646741868996176, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (0.997 = 99.7% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744302416 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 16:26:56 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the API access issues are resolved and attempt to fetch the data again.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744302416 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 16:26:56 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the API access issues are resolved and attempt to fetch the data again. Consider verifying the API status or exploring alternative methods to retrieve the necessary price data.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\n\ndef fetch_binance_price(date, symbol=\"BTCUSDT\"):\n    \"\"\"Fetch the closing price of a cryptocurrency from Binance at a specific date and time.\"\"\"\n    base_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": symbol,\n        \"interval\": \"1m\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": int(date.timestamp() * 1000),  # Convert to milliseconds\n        \"endTime\": int(date.timestamp() * 1000)\n    }\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data and len(data) > 0:\n            return float(data[0][4])  # Closing price is the fifth element in the list\n        else:\n            return None\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data from Binance: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef resolve_market():\n    # Define the timezone\n    et_timezone = pytz.timezone('America/New_York')\n    \n    # Define the dates for price comparison\n    date1 = datetime(2025, 4, 9, 12, 0, tzinfo=et_timezone)\n    date2 = datetime(2025, 4, 10, 12, 0, tzinfo=et_timezone)\n    \n    # Fetch prices\n    price1 = fetch_binance_price(date1)\n    price2 = fetch_binance_price(date2)\n    \n    # Check and compare prices\n    if price1 is None or price2 is None:\n        print(\"Failed to fetch prices.\")\n        return \"recommendation: p4\"\n    elif price1 < price2:\n        return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Up\n    elif price1 > price2:\n        return \"recommendation: p1\"  # Down\n    else:\n        return \"recommendation: p3\"  # 50-50\n\n# Execute the resolution function and print the result\nresult = resolve_market()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError fetching data from Binance: 451 Client Error:  for url: https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=1744217760000&endTime=1744217760000\nError fetching data from Binance: 451 Client Error:  for url: https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=1744304160000&endTime=1744304160000\nFailed to fetch prices.\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price on Binance's BTCUSDT pair went up or down between April 9th and April 10th at noon ET. The resolution depends on comparing the closing prices of the 1-minute candles at those specific times.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 10, 2025, 16:26:56 UTC. Since ET is UTC-4, noon ET on April 10th would be 16:00 UTC. The current time is 16:26 UTC, which is after the 10th's noon ET. So the event has already occurred, and I need to verify the closing prices for both days.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [4] mentions that on April 9th at 11:06 AM UTC, BTC dropped below 76,000 USDT to 75,979.1875. However, the query specifies noon ET, which is 16:00 UTC. So I need the exact 1-minute candle close at 16:00 UTC on April 9th. The data in [4] is from 11:06 AM UTC, which is earlier, so not directly relevant.\n\nResult [12] from Coinalyze shows a live price chart. At 12:50:41 UTC on April 10th, the price was around 82,635 USDT. But this is before the 16:00 UTC cutoff. The 24-hour data shows a high of 84,720 and a low of 81,211.24, but again, not the specific time.\n\nResult [13] from CoinGecko lists the BTCUSDT futures price as $83,637.52, but this is a recent snapshot, not the specific 1-minute close. The Binance API data in [8] might have historical candles, but the provided data doesn't include the exact times needed.\n\nThe user specified that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1-minute candles. Since the current time is past the event, I should check if the closing prices are available in the provided data. However, the search results don't include the exact 1-minute closes at 16:00 UTC on both days. \n\nGiven that the event date is in the past and no verifiable information on the exact closing prices is provided, I have to infer based on available data. The ancillary data says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The market resolves to Up if April 10th's close is higher than April 9th's. \n\nLooking at the general trend: On April 9th, BTC was around 75k-80k, and on April 10th, the price in [12] shows a 24-hour high of 84,720, suggesting an upward movement. However, without the exact closes, there's uncertainty. But since the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no info, and given the price increased from the 9th's lower prices to the 10th's higher, it's likely Up. So recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The resolution depends on comparing the closing prices of the 1-minute candles at those specific times.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 10, 2025, 16:26:56 UTC. Since ET is UTC-4, noon ET on April 10th would be 16:00 UTC. The current time is 16:26 UTC, which is after the 10th's noon ET. So the event has already occurred, and I need to verify the closing prices for both days.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [4] mentions that on April 9th at 11:06 AM UTC, BTC dropped below 76,000 USDT to 75,979.1875. However, the query specifies noon ET, which is 16:00 UTC. So I need the exact 1-minute candle close at 16:00 UTC on April 9th. The data in [4] is from 11:06 AM UTC, which is earlier, so not directly relevant.\n\nResult [12] from Coinalyze shows a live price chart. At 12:50:41 UTC on April 10th, the price was around 82,635 USDT. But this is before the 16:00 UTC cutoff. The 24-hour data shows a high of 84,720 and a low of 81,211.24, but again, not the specific time.\n\nResult [13] from CoinGecko lists the BTCUSDT futures price as $83,637.52, but this is a recent snapshot, not the specific 1-minute close. The Binance API data in [8] might have historical candles, but the provided data doesn't include the exact times needed.\n\nThe user specified that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1-minute candles. Since the current time is past the event, I should check if the closing prices are available in the provided data. However, the search results don't include the exact 1-minute closes at 16:00 UTC on both days. \n\nGiven that the event date is in the past and no verifiable information on the exact closing prices is provided, I have to infer based on available data. The ancillary data says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The market resolves to Up if April 10th's close is higher than April 9th's. \n\nLooking at the general trend: On April 9th, BTC was around 75k-80k, and on April 10th, the price in [12] shows a 24-hour high of 84,720, suggesting an upward movement. However, without the exact closes, there's uncertainty. But since the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no info, and given the price increased from the 9th's lower prices to the 10th's higher, it's likely Up. So recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744302416 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 16:26:56 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

It correctly identifies the need for specific data points (closing prices at specific times) and acknowledges the absence of exact data for the required times. The solver uses available general market data to infer the most probable outcome, which aligns with the instructions provided in the user prompt. The solver's recommendation of 'Up' (p2) is supported by the general upward trend observed in the data provided. However, the response could be improved by explicitly stating the lack of exact closing prices at the specified times, which introduces a degree of uncertainty in the recommendation.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744302416 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 16:26:56 UTC",
