        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the NHL game between the Seattle Kraken and Vegas Golden Knights on April 10, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Golden Knights win, p2 for Kraken win, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game was scheduled for April 10, which is in the past. That means the event should have occurred. Now, I need to verify the result using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. For example, result [1] is a preview from April 10, talking about the upcoming game. But since the current date is April 11, the game should have results. However, none of the search results explicitly state the outcome of the game. Wait, let me check again.\n\nResult [16] is a box score and stats link, but when I look at the content, it's actually a repeat of the preview from CBS Sports, not the actual result. Similarly, result [17] on ESPN also doesn't show the final score, just a preview. The same goes for other sources like [3], [7], and others\u2014they all seem to be previews or predictions, not post-game reports. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each result again. Result [6] from ESPN has a live score page, but the content shows the series is tied 1-1 with the third game on April 10. However, the detailed stats don't show the final score. Result [12] has a live-result page, but the content is just statistical breakdowns without the actual score. \n\nSince all the provided search results are from before the game or previews, and none report the actual outcome, there's no verifiable information confirming who won. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Golden Knights were heavy favorites (-250 in result [4]), and predictions like [9] and [11] expected a Vegas win. However, without explicit confirmation from the sources, I can't definitively say they won. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date has passed, we should assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also state that if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut in this case, the sources don't provide the outcome, so we have to go with the most probable. The Golden Knights were the favorites, so p1. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 for canceled, but the game wasn't canceled. Since the game was played (as per the date), but no sources confirm the result, maybe it's p4? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, since there's no info, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5 for canceled, but the game wasn't canceled. The event was scheduled and presumably played, but no sources confirm the result. Therefore, since the outcome can't be verified, despite predictions, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, even without sources, we assume the most probable outcome. The Golden Knights were the heavy favorites, so p1. But the instructions also say that if the outcome can't be reasonably inferred, default to p4. However, the predictions and odds strongly suggest Vegas was likely to win. Therefore, the resolution should be p1. But I need to be careful here. The key is whether the outcome can be reasonably inferred. Since all sources are previews and no post-game reports, but the game date has passed, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, I think p1 is correct. However, the strict rule is that if there's no verifiable info, even if probable, it's p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... resolve the query based on the most probable outcome... unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, since there's no contradiction, assume the most probable, which is Vegas (p1). Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the NHL game between the Seattle Kraken and Vegas Golden Knights on April 10, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Golden Knights win, p2 for Kraken win, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game was scheduled for April 10, which is in the past. That means the event should have occurred. Now, I need to verify the result using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. For example, result [1] is a preview from April 10, talking about the upcoming game. But since the current date is April 11, the game should have results. However, none of the search results explicitly state the outcome of the game. Wait, let me check again.\n\nResult [16] is a box score and stats link, but when I look at the content, it's actually a repeat of the preview from CBS Sports, not the actual result. Similarly, result [17] on ESPN also doesn't show the final score, just a preview. The same goes for other sources like [3], [7], and others\u2014they all seem to be previews or predictions, not post-game reports. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each result again. Result [6] from ESPN has a live score page, but the content shows the series is tied 1-1 with the third game on April 10. However, the detailed stats don't show the final score. Result [12] has a live-result page, but the content is just statistical breakdowns without the actual score. \n\nSince all the provided search results are from before the game or previews, and none report the actual outcome, there's no verifiable information confirming who won. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Golden Knights were heavy favorites (-250 in result [4]), and predictions like [9] and [11] expected a Vegas win. However, without explicit confirmation from the sources, I can't definitively say they won. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date has passed, we should assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also state that if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut in this case, the sources don't provide the outcome, so we have to go with the most probable. The Golden Knights were the favorites, so p1. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 for canceled, but the game wasn't canceled. Since the game was played (as per the date), but no sources confirm the result, maybe it's p4? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, since there's no info, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5 for canceled, but the game wasn't canceled. The event was scheduled and presumably played, but no sources confirm the result. Therefore, since the outcome can't be verified, despite predictions, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, even without sources, we assume the most probable outcome. The Golden Knights were the heavy favorites, so p1. But the instructions also say that if the outcome can't be reasonably inferred, default to p4. However, the predictions and odds strongly suggest Vegas was likely to win. Therefore, the resolution should be p1. But I need to be careful here. The key is whether the outcome can be reasonably inferred. Since all sources are previews and no post-game reports, but the game date has passed, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, I think p1 is correct. However, the strict rule is that if there's no verifiable info, even if probable, it's p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... resolve the query based on the most probable outcome... unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, since there's no contradiction, assume the most probable, which is Vegas (p1).

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the NHL game between the Seattle Kraken and Vegas Golden Knights on April 10, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Golden Knights win, p2 for Kraken win, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game was scheduled for April 10, which is in the past. That means the event should have occurred. Now, I need to verify the result using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. For example, result [1] is a preview from April 10, talking about the upcoming game. But since the current date is April 11, the game should have results. However, none of the search results explicitly state the outcome of the game. Wait, let me check again.\n\nResult [16] is a box score and stats link, but when I look at the content, it's actually a repeat of the preview from CBS Sports, not the actual result. Similarly, result [17] on ESPN also doesn't show the final score, just a preview. The same goes for other sources like [3], [7], and others\u2014they all seem to be previews or predictions, not post-game reports. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each result again. Result [6] from ESPN has a live score page, but the content shows the series is tied 1-1 with the third game on April 10. However, the detailed stats don't show the final score. Result [12] has a live-result page, but the content is just statistical breakdowns without the actual score. \n\nSince all the provided search results are from before the game or previews, and none report the actual outcome, there's no verifiable information confirming who won. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Golden Knights were heavy favorites (-250 in result [4]), and predictions like [9] and [11] expected a Vegas win. However, without explicit confirmation from the sources, I can't definitively say they won. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date has passed, we should assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also state that if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut in this case, the sources don't provide the outcome, so we have to go with the most probable. The Golden Knights were the favorites, so p1. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 for canceled, but the game wasn't canceled. Since the game was played (as per the date), but no sources confirm the result, maybe it's p4? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

Result [6] from ESPN has a live score page, but the content shows the series is tied 1-1 with the third game on April 10. However, the detailed stats don't show the final score. Result [12] has a live-result page, but the content is just statistical breakdowns without the actual score. \n\nSince all the provided search results are from before the game or previews, and none report the actual outcome, there's no verifiable information confirming who won. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Golden Knights were heavy favorites (-250 in result [4]), and predictions like [9] and [11] expected a Vegas win. However, without explicit confirmation from the sources, I can't definitively say they won. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date has passed, we should assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also state that if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut in this case, the sources don't provide the outcome, so we have to go with the most probable. The Golden Knights were the favorites, so p1. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 for canceled, but the game wasn't canceled. Since the game was played (as per the date), but no sources confirm the result, maybe it's p4? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, since there's no info, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5 for canceled, but the game wasn't canceled. The event was scheduled and presumably played, but no sources confirm the result. Therefore, since the outcome can't be verified, despite predictions, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, even without sources, we assume the most probable outcome. The Golden Knights were the heavy favorites, so p1. But the instructions also say that if the outcome can't be reasonably inferred, default to p4. However, the predictions and odds strongly suggest Vegas was likely to win. Therefore, the resolution should be p1. But I need to be careful here. The key is whether the outcome can be reasonably inferred. Since all sources are previews and no post-game reports, but the game date has passed, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, I think p1 is correct. However, the strict rule is that if there's no verifiable info, even if probable, it's p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... resolve the query based on the most probable outcome... unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, since there's no contradiction, assume the most probable, which is Vegas (p1). Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Kraken, Price: 0.07, ID: 25492095893280005328816552255490417725823342030746806859435524816012193540795, Winner: No\n- Token: Golden Knights, Price: 0.93, ID: 4000697784196781704577390209740478173668324432468586108297494596521838877653, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Golden Knights outcome (0.930 = 93.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744346267 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 04:37:47 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the NHL game between the Seattle Kraken and Vegas Golden Knights on April 10, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Golden Knights win, p2 for Kraken win, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game was scheduled for April 10, which is in the past. That means the event should have occurred. Now, I need to verify the result using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. For example, result [1] is a preview from April 10, talking about the upcoming game. But since the current date is April 11, the game should have results. However, none of the search results explicitly state the outcome of the game. Wait, let me check again.\n\nResult [16] is a box score and stats link, but when I look at the content, it's actually a repeat of the preview from CBS Sports, not the actual result. Similarly, result [17] on ESPN also doesn't show the final score, just a preview. The same goes for other sources like [3], [7], and others\u2014they all seem to be previews or predictions, not post-game reports. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each result again. Result [6] from ESPN has a live score page, but the content shows the series is tied 1-1 with the third game on April 10. However, the detailed stats don't show the final score. Result [12] has a live-result page, but the content is just statistical breakdowns without the actual score. \n\nSince all the provided search results are from before the game or previews, and none report the actual outcome, there's no verifiable information confirming who won. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Golden Knights were heavy favorites (-250 in result [4]), and predictions like [9] and [11] expected a Vegas win. However, without explicit confirmation from the sources, I can't definitively say they won. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date has passed, we should assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also state that if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut in this case, the sources don't provide the outcome, so we have to go with the most probable. The Golden Knights were the favorites, so p1. However, the user also mentioned that if the event is in the past and no info is available, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 for canceled, but the game wasn't canceled. Since the game was played (as per the date), but no sources confirm the result, maybe it's p4? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, since there's no info, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5 for canceled, but the game wasn't canceled. The event was scheduled and presumably played, but no sources confirm the result. Therefore, since the outcome can't be verified, despite predictions, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, even without sources, we assume the most probable outcome. The Golden Knights were the heavy favorites, so p1. But the instructions also say that if the outcome can't be reasonably inferred, default to p4.

The key is whether the outcome can be reasonably inferred. Since all sources are previews and no post-game reports, but the game date has passed, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, I think p1 is correct. However, the strict rule is that if there's no verifiable info, even if probable, it's p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... resolve the query based on the most probable outcome... unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, since there's no contradiction, assume the most probable, which is Vegas (p1).

Despite the game being in the past, the solver failed to find verifiable post-game results and relied heavily on pre-game predictions and odds to suggest a probable outcome. The response oscillates between different potential outcomes (p1 and p4) and ultimately recommends p1 based on the assumption of the most probable outcome. However, this approach contradicts the requirement for verifiable evidence to support the resolution. Furthermore, the response does not adequately address the strong market sentiment which heavily favors the Golden Knights, indicating a significant discrepancy between the solver's recommendation and market confidence.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744346267 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 04:37:47 UTC",
