  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744251027 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 02:10:27 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Flyers vs. Rangers game on April 9, 2025. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The timestamp given is April 10, 2025, 2:10:27 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time of April 9, 7:30 PM ET. So the event has already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, the primary sources are the box scores and game summaries. Result [1] is a box score from CBS Sports dated 2025-04-10, which would be the day after the game. It mentions the Rangers' record as 36-34-7 and the Flyers as 31-37-9, but the actual game result isn't explicitly stated here. However, result [3] from thescore.com lists the Flyers' record as 26-26-8 and the Rangers as 36-34-7, but this might be a typo or outdated info. \n\nResult [4] from CBS Sports on April 9, 2025, talks about the Rangers' situation but doesn't give the game result. Result [5] is a YouTube video titled \"New York Rangers vs Philadelphia Flyers 4/9/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay,\" but the transcript shows the Flyers scoring first and the game being tied at some point. However, this is a gameplay video, not a real-life game, so it's not a reliable source.\n\nResult [6] is an ESPN box score from November 29, 2024, which is an older game and irrelevant. Result [7] from Sportskeeda on April 9, 2025, provides a preview with a prediction of Rangers winning 4-1, but predictions aren't factual. Result [8] is another ESPN box score from April 11, 2024, also an older game.\n\nResult [9] from Docsports on April 8, 2025, is a preview with stats but no result. Result [10] from leans.ai gives betting trends but no actual game outcome. Result [11] from ATS.io on April 9, 2025, is another preview without the result. Result [12] from PickDawgz on April 9, 2025, also a preview. Result [13] from scores24.live on April 9, 2025, mentions previous meetings but not the current game. Result [14] from freepicks.net on April 8, 2025, predicts a Rangers 4-2 win, but again, a prediction.\n\nThe critical source is result [1], the CBS Sports box score from April 10, which should have the game's outcome. However, the content provided doesn't explicitly state the result. The URL suggests it's the box score for the game, but the text in the search result is about the Rangers' season struggles and their previous game against Tampa Bay. There's a mention of the Flyers firing their coach on March 27, but no score for the April 9 game.\n\nGiven that the user provided ancillary data where p2 corresponds to Flyers winning, and the absence of explicit game results in the sources, I need to infer. Since the current date is after the game, and no sources explicitly state the result, but some previews predicted a Rangers win, but those are just predictions. Without verified data, the safest resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Rangers, p2 as Flyers. \n\nWait, the user's resolution_conditions have p1 as Rangers, p2 as Flyers. If the game happened and no sources confirm the result, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Flyers were underdogs, but if there's no data, maybe default to p4. However, the CBS Sports box score (result [1]) might have the actual result, but the provided text doesn't show it. The URL is for the game on April 9, but the content in the search result is about the Rangers' season, not the specific game. \n\nThis is tricky. Without explicit confirmation from a reliable source like ESPN or CBS Sports stating the result, I can't be certain. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Rangers were at home, and some previews favored them. But without concrete data, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user might have intended that the game did occur, and the lack of explicit result in the provided sources is an oversight. Alternatively, maybe the YouTube video (result [5]) is considered, but it's a simulation. \n\nWait, the YouTube video's transcript shows the Flyers scoring first, but it's a gameplay video, not real. So it's irrelevant. \n\nGiven all this, since the event date has passed and no sources explicitly report the outcome, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if no info, which would be the Rangers as they were favored. But without confirmation, the safe answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data have p1 as Rangers, p2 as Flyers. If the Rangers were more likely to win, then p1. But without data, it's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the actual result is in the search results but not properly extracted. For example, result [1] might have the score in the URL but the text doesn't show it. The URL is https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/gametracker/boxscore/NHL_20250409_PHI@NYR/, which suggests the game was played, but the content in the search result is a preview before the game. Similarly, result [3] from thescore.com lists the game as happening on April 9, but the stats shown are from earlier in the season. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit result in the provided sources, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Rangers were at home and had a better record, maybe p1. But this is a conflict. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So ancillary data defines p1 as Rangers win, p2 as Flyers. If no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify probabilities, just the mapping. So if we have to assume the most probable, but without any data, it's unclear. However, the user's instruction says \"if no verifiable information about the event's outcome... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt.\" The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide probabilities, just the resolution mapping. Therefore, without any data, we can't assume, so p4. \n\nBut the user's instruction also says, \"if the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\" The available information includes the Rangers having a better record and being at home, but the Flyers had recent wins. However, without explicit game results, it's not reasonable to infer. Therefore, the answer should be p4. \n\nBut wait, the search results include a box score URL (result [1]) which should have the result, but the provided text doesn't include it. If the actual game result is in that URL but not shown in the search result snippet, the assistant can't access it. Therefore, based on the provided search results, there's no explicit outcome, so p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Flyers vs. Rangers game on April 9, 2025. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The timestamp given is April 10, 2025, 2:10:27 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time of April 9, 7:30 PM ET. So the event has already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, the primary sources are the box scores and game summaries. Result [1] is a box score from CBS Sports dated 2025-04-10, which would be the day after the game. It mentions the Rangers' record as 36-34-7 and the Flyers as 31-37-9, but the actual game result isn't explicitly stated here. However, result [3] from thescore.com lists the Flyers' record as 26-26-8 and the Rangers as 36-34-7, but this might be a typo or outdated info. \n\nResult [4] from CBS Sports on April 9, 2025, talks about the Rangers' situation but doesn't give the game result. Result [5] is a YouTube video titled \"New York Rangers vs Philadelphia Flyers 4/9/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay,\" but the transcript shows the Flyers scoring first and the game being tied at some point. However, this is a gameplay video, not a real-life game, so it's not a reliable source.\n\nResult [6] is an ESPN box score from November 29, 2024, which is an older game and irrelevant. Result [7] from Sportskeeda on April 9, 2025, provides a preview with a prediction of Rangers winning 4-1, but predictions aren't factual. Result [8] is another ESPN box score from April 11, 2024, also an older game.\n\nResult [9] from Docsports on April 8, 2025, is a preview with stats but no result. Result [10] from leans.ai gives betting trends but no actual game outcome. Result [11] from ATS.io on April 9, 2025, is another preview without the result. Result [12] from PickDawgz on April 9, 2025, also a preview. Result [13] from scores24.live on April 9, 2025, mentions previous meetings but not the current game. Result [14] from freepicks.net on April 8, 2025, predicts a Rangers 4-2 win, but again, a prediction.\n\nThe critical source is result [1], the CBS Sports box score from April 10, which should have the game's outcome. However, the content provided doesn't explicitly state the result. The URL suggests it's the box score for the game, but the text in the search result is about the Rangers' season struggles and their previous game against Tampa Bay. There's a mention of the Flyers firing their coach on March 27, but no score for the April 9 game.\n\nGiven that the user provided ancillary data where p2 corresponds to Flyers winning, and the absence of explicit game results in the sources, I need to infer. Since the current date is after the game, and no sources explicitly state the result, but some previews predicted a Rangers win, but those are just predictions. Without verified data, the safest resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Rangers, p2 as Flyers. \n\nWait, the user's resolution_conditions have p1 as Rangers, p2 as Flyers. If the game happened and no sources confirm the result, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Flyers were underdogs, but if there's no data, maybe default to p4. However, the CBS Sports box score (result [1]) might have the actual result, but the provided text doesn't show it. The URL is for the game on April 9, but the content in the search result is about the Rangers' season, not the specific game. \n\nThis is tricky. Without explicit confirmation from a reliable source like ESPN or CBS Sports stating the result, I can't be certain. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Rangers were at home, and some previews favored them. But without concrete data, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user might have intended that the game did occur, and the lack of explicit result in the provided sources is an oversight. Alternatively, maybe the YouTube video (result [5]) is considered, but it's a simulation. \n\nWait, the YouTube video's transcript shows the Flyers scoring first, but it's a gameplay video, not real. So it's irrelevant. \n\nGiven all this, since the event date has passed and no sources explicitly report the outcome, but the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if no info, which would be the Rangers as they were favored.
