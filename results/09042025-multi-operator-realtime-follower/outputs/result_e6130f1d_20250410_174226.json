The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and news articles from that specific date. Let's look at the relevant ones.\n\nSearch result [1] is a transcript from the White House on February 26, 2025. Trump mentions President Zelenskyy and talks about an agreement, but there's no mention of \"President Xi\" here. \n\nSearch result [2] is from April 10, 2025, where Trump calls Xi a \"very smart man\" during a White House press interaction. However, this might be from a different event, not the cabinet meeting. The article mentions he spoke to reporters at the White House, but the exact timing isn't clear. \n\nSearch result [4] is a YouTube video transcript from April 10, 2025, of a cabinet meeting. Trump discusses tariffs and mentions waiting for a call from Xi. The transcript includes Trump saying, \"he does expect to have conversations with President Xi but that is between them.\" Here, he uses \"President Xi,\" which matches the query's term. \n\nSearch result [5] is another April 10 article where Trump praises Xi as a \"smart man\" at the White House. Again, it's unclear if this was during the cabinet meeting. \n\nSearch result [7] is a CBS News transcript from April 10, mentioning China's open door for talks and Trump's comments during the cabinet meeting. The transcript includes Commerce Secretary Lutnick stating, \"the president you know he he does expect to have conversations with President Xi but that is between them.\" This indicates that during the cabinet meeting, Trump's team referenced \"President Xi,\" but it's not clear if Trump himself said it.\n\nWait, in search result [4], the transcript includes Trump's participation in the cabinet meeting. The exact quote from the transcript is: \"the president you know he he does expect to have conversations with President Xi but that is between them.\" Wait, that's actually Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick speaking, not Trump. So Trump didn't say \"President Xi\" himself in that instance.\n\nLooking at search result [15], a YouTube video from April 9, Trump mentions \"President Xi is a proud man,\" but that's the day before the cabinet meeting. \n\nSearch result [6] is a transcript from a fictional cabinet meeting in January 2025, which isn't relevant here. \n\nSearch result [9] is from March 3, 2025, where Trump discusses tariffs but doesn't mention \"President Xi\" in the provided excerpts. \n\nSearch result [14] from April 10, 2025, discusses Xi's stance but doesn't quote Trump using \"President Xi\" during the meeting. \n\nThe key point is whether Trump himself uttered \"President Xi\" during the April 10 cabinet meeting. From the available sources, the only direct mention is in search result [4], but that's from Commerce Secretary Lutnick, not Trump. The other mentions on April 10 are from press interactions, not the cabinet meeting. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no evidence that Trump said \"President Xi\" during the cabinet meeting on April 10. The mentions of Xi were by other officials or in different contexts. Thus, the resolution should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"President Xi\" during his cabinet meeting on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and news articles from that specific date. Let's look at the relevant ones.\n\nSearch result [1] is a transcript from the White House on February 26, 2025. Trump mentions President Zelenskyy and talks about an agreement, but there's no mention of \"President Xi\" here. \n\nSearch result [2] is from April 10, 2025, where Trump calls Xi a \"very smart man\" during a White House press interaction. However, this might be from a different event, not the cabinet meeting. The article mentions he spoke to reporters at the White House, but the exact timing isn't clear. \n\nSearch result [4] is a YouTube video transcript from April 10, 2025, of a cabinet meeting. Trump discusses tariffs and mentions waiting for a call from Xi. The transcript includes Trump saying, \"he does expect to have conversations with President Xi but that is between them.\" Here, he uses \"President Xi,\" which matches the query's term. \n\nSearch result [5] is another April 10 article where Trump praises Xi as a \"smart man\" at the White House. Again, it's unclear if this was during the cabinet meeting. \n\nSearch result [7] is a CBS News transcript from April 10, mentioning China's open door for talks and Trump's comments during the cabinet meeting. The transcript includes Commerce Secretary Lutnick stating, \"the president you know he he does expect to have conversations with President Xi but that is between them.\" This indicates that during the cabinet meeting, Trump's team referenced \"President Xi,\" but it's not clear if Trump himself said it.\n\nWait, in search result [4], the transcript includes Trump's participation in the cabinet meeting. The exact quote from the transcript is: \"the president you know he he does expect to have conversations with President Xi but that is between them.\" Wait, that's actually Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick speaking, not Trump. So Trump didn't say \"President Xi\" himself in that instance.\n\nLooking at search result [15], a YouTube video from April 9, Trump mentions \"President Xi is a proud man,\" but that's the day before the cabinet meeting. \n\nSearch result [6] is a transcript from a fictional cabinet meeting in January 2025, which isn't relevant here. \n\nSearch result [9] is from March 3, 2025, where Trump discusses tariffs but doesn't mention \"President Xi\" in the provided excerpts. \n\nSearch result [14] from April 10, 2025, discusses Xi's stance but doesn't quote Trump using \"President Xi\" during the meeting. \n\nThe key point is whether Trump himself uttered \"President Xi\" during the April 10 cabinet meeting. From the available sources, the only direct mention is in search result [4], but that's from Commerce Secretary Lutnick, not Trump. The other mentions on April 10 are from press interactions, not the cabinet meeting. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no evidence that Trump said \"President Xi\" during the cabinet meeting on April 10. The mentions of Xi were by other officials or in different contexts. Thus, the resolution should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.515, ID: 50001314710597061439499725323266481571478869678577156713233014402500598582544, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.485, ID: 29156655586623063131736030632670655893315546303383633321165426257644837666248, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.515, NO: 0.485)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

So Trump didn't say \"President Xi\" himself in that instance.\n\nLooking at search result [15], a YouTube video from April 9, Trump mentions \"President Xi is a proud man,\" but that's the day before the cabinet meeting. \n\nSearch result [6] is a transcript from a fictional cabinet meeting in January 2025, which isn't relevant here. \n\nSearch result [9] is from March 3, 2025, where Trump discusses tariffs but doesn't mention \"President Xi\" in the provided excerpts. \n\nSearch result [14] from April 10, 2025, discusses Xi's stance but doesn't quote Trump using \"President Xi\" during the meeting. \n\nThe key point is whether Trump himself uttered \"President Xi\" during the April 10 cabinet meeting. From the available sources, the only direct mention is in search result [4], but that's from Commerce Secretary Lutnick, not Trump. The other mentions on April 10 are from press interactions, not the cabinet meeting. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no evidence that Trump said \"President Xi\" during the cabinet meeting on April 10. The mentions of Xi were by other officials or in different contexts. Thus, the resolution should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.515, ID: 50001314710597061439499725323266481571478869678577156713233014402500598582544, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.485, ID: 29156655586623063131736030632670655893315546303383633321165426257644837666248, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.515, NO: 0.485)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744306756 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 17:39:16 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"President Xi\" during his cabinet meeting on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and news articles from that specific date. Let's look at the relevant ones.\n\nSearch result [1] is a transcript from the White House on February 26, 2025. Trump mentions President Zelenskyy and talks about an agreement, but there's no mention of \"President Xi\" here. \n\nSearch result [2] is from April 10, 2025, where Trump calls Xi a \"very smart man\" during a White House press interaction. However, this might be from a different event, not the cabinet meeting. The article mentions he spoke to reporters at the White House, but the exact timing isn't clear. \n\nSearch result [4] is a YouTube video transcript from April 10, 2025, of a cabinet meeting. Trump discusses tariffs and mentions waiting for a call from Xi. The transcript includes Trump saying, \"he does expect to have conversations with President Xi but that is between them.\" Here, he uses \"President Xi,\" which matches the query's term. \n\nSearch result [5] is another April 10 article where Trump praises Xi as a \"smart man\" at the White House. Again, it's unclear if this was during the cabinet meeting. \n\nSearch result [7] is a CBS News transcript from April 10, mentioning China's open door for talks and Trump's comments during the cabinet meeting. The transcript includes Commerce Secretary Lutnick stating, \"the president you know he he does expect to have conversations with President Xi but that is between them.\" This indicates that during the cabinet meeting, Trump's team referenced \"President Xi,\" but it's not clear if Trump himself said it.\n\nWait, in search result [4], the transcript includes Trump's participation in the cabinet meeting. The exact quote from the transcript is: \"the president you know he he does expect to have conversations with President Xi but that is between them.\" Wait, that's actually Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick speaking, not Trump. So Trump didn't say \"President Xi\" himself in that instance.\n\nLooking at search result [15], a YouTube video from April 9, Trump mentions \"President Xi is a proud man,\" but that's the day before the cabinet meeting. \n\nSearch result [6] is a transcript from a fictional cabinet meeting in January 2025, which isn't relevant here. \n\nSearch result [9] is from March 3, 2025, where Trump discusses tariffs but doesn't mention \"President Xi\" in the provided excerpts. \n\nSearch result [14] from April 10, 2025, discusses Xi's stance but doesn't quote Trump using \"President Xi\" during the meeting. \n\nThe key point is whether Trump himself uttered \"President Xi\" during the April 10 cabinet meeting. From the available sources, the only direct mention is in search result [4], but that's from Commerce Secretary Lutnick, not Trump. The other mentions on April 10 are from press interactions, not the cabinet meeting. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no evidence that Trump said \"President Xi\" during the cabinet meeting on April 10. The mentions of Xi were by other officials or in different contexts. Thus, the resolution should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.515, ID: 50001314710597061439499725323266481571478869678577156713233014402500598582544, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.485, ID: 29156655586623063131736030632670655893315546303383633321165426257644837666248, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.515, NO: 0.485)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744306756 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 17:39:16 UTC",
