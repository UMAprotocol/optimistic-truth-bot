The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he lowers, pauses, delays, or removes the reciprocal tariffs on 39 out of the 76 listed countries by April 30, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events. The key dates here are April 2nd when the tariffs were announced, April 5th when the 10% baseline started, and April 9th when the higher reciprocal tariffs were supposed to take effect. But then on April 9th, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those reciprocal tariffs, reducing them to the 10% baseline for all countries except China. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially [1], [3], [8], [9], and [14], they all mention the pause. The original list had 76 countries, but the pause affects all except China. The user's query mentions 76 countries, with 59 specifically listed plus the EU. The EU has 27 member states, so if the EU's reciprocal tariff is reduced, that counts as 27 countries. \n\nThe pause on April 9th lowered the tariffs from the higher rates (like 20% for the EU, 24% for Japan, etc.) back to the 10% baseline. However, the user's resolution condition says that the 10% general tariff doesn't count. Wait, the pause actually reduces the reciprocal tariffs to 10%, which was the baseline. But the query specifies that reductions in the reciprocal tariffs count, even if they're just paused. The ancillary data says that lowering the reciprocal tariff qualifies, even if it's a pause. \n\nSo, the April 9th pause effectively lowers the reciprocal tariffs from their higher rates to 10% for 75 countries (excluding China). Since the EU is one of the listed entities, reducing their tariff from 20% to 10% would count as 27 countries. Adding the other countries affected by the pause, it's well over 39. Therefore, the condition for \"Yes\" is met because Trump took executive action (the pause) that lowered the reciprocal tariffs on more than 39 countries. \n\nI need to confirm that the pause is considered an executive action. According to [3] and [8], Trump announced the pause via a Truth Social post and it was an executive decision, not legislation. The ancillary data allows for executive actions. Also, the pause was enacted within the timeframe (by April 30th). \n\nTherefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user is asking whether Trump will reduce the majority of tariffs he imposed in April 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he lowers, pauses, delays, or removes the reciprocal tariffs on 39 out of the 76 listed countries by April 30, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events. The key dates here are April 2nd when the tariffs were announced, April 5th when the 10% baseline started, and April 9th when the higher reciprocal tariffs were supposed to take effect. But then on April 9th, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those reciprocal tariffs, reducing them to the 10% baseline for all countries except China. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially [1], [3], [8], [9], and [14], they all mention the pause. The original list had 76 countries, but the pause affects all except China. The user's query mentions 76 countries, with 59 specifically listed plus the EU. The EU has 27 member states, so if the EU's reciprocal tariff is reduced, that counts as 27 countries. \n\nThe pause on April 9th lowered the tariffs from the higher rates (like 20% for the EU, 24% for Japan, etc.) back to the 10% baseline. However, the user's resolution condition says that the 10% general tariff doesn't count. Wait, the pause actually reduces the reciprocal tariffs to 10%, which was the baseline. But the query specifies that reductions in the reciprocal tariffs count, even if they're just paused. The ancillary data says that lowering the reciprocal tariff qualifies, even if it's a pause. \n\nSo, the April 9th pause effectively lowers the reciprocal tariffs from their higher rates to 10% for 75 countries (excluding China). Since the EU is one of the listed entities, reducing their tariff from 20% to 10% would count as 27 countries. Adding the other countries affected by the pause, it's well over 39. Therefore, the condition for \"Yes\" is met because Trump took executive action (the pause) that lowered the reciprocal tariffs on more than 39 countries. \n\nI need to confirm that the pause is considered an executive action. According to [3] and [8], Trump announced the pause via a Truth Social post and it was an executive decision, not legislation. The ancillary data allows for executive actions. Also, the pause was enacted within the timeframe (by April 30th). \n\nTherefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.975, ID: 19870474264312551277278269310414476568370577611412559209589431729430531609654, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.025, ID: 60174477147187565644846761474125126682036893726144153666841930074244413790032, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.975 = 97.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744301201 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 16:06:41 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Trump will reduce the majority of tariffs he imposed in April 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he lowers, pauses, delays, or removes the reciprocal tariffs on 39 out of the 76 listed countries by April 30, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events. The key dates here are April 2nd when the tariffs were announced, April 5th when the 10% baseline started, and April 9th when the higher reciprocal tariffs were supposed to take effect. But then on April 9th, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those reciprocal tariffs, reducing them to the 10% baseline for all countries except China. \n\nLooking at the search results, especially [1], [3], [8], [9], and [14], they all mention the pause. The original list had 76 countries, but the pause affects all except China. The user's query mentions 76 countries, with 59 specifically listed plus the EU. The EU has 27 member states, so if the EU's reciprocal tariff is reduced, that counts as 27 countries. \n\nThe pause on April 9th lowered the tariffs from the higher rates (like 20% for the EU, 24% for Japan, etc.) back to the 10% baseline. However, the user's resolution condition says that the 10% general tariff doesn't count. Wait, the pause actually reduces the reciprocal tariffs to 10%, which was the baseline. But the query specifies that reductions in the reciprocal tariffs count, even if they're just paused. The ancillary data says that lowering the reciprocal tariff qualifies, even if it's a pause. \n\nSo, the April 9th pause effectively lowers the reciprocal tariffs from their higher rates to 10% for 75 countries (excluding China). Since the EU is one of the listed entities, reducing their tariff from 20% to 10% would count as 27 countries. Adding the other countries affected by the pause, it's well over 39. Therefore, the condition for \"Yes\" is met because Trump took executive action (the pause) that lowered the reciprocal tariffs on more than 39 countries. \n\nI need to confirm that the pause is considered an executive action. According to [3] and [8], Trump announced the pause via a Truth Social post and it was an executive decision, not legislation. The ancillary data allows for executive actions. Also, the pause was enacted within the timeframe (by April 30th). \n\nTherefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.975, ID: 19870474264312551277278269310414476568370577611412559209589431729430531609654, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.025, ID: 60174477147187565644846761474125126682036893726144153666841930074244413790032, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.975 = 97.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
