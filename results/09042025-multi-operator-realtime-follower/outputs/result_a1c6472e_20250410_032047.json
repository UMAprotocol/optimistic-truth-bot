  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744255150 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 03:19:10 UTC",

The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's an official announcement of a pause, delay, or removal by April 9 at 12:00 AM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline. The tariffs were announced on April 2, set to take effect on April 9. The current date is April 10, 2025, so the event date has passed. The key is to determine if an official pause was announced before the deadline.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. For example, result [1] from CBS News on April 10 states that Trump announced a 90-day pause on most new tariffs, effective immediately, which would include the EU. Result [3] from Supply Chain Dive confirms the pause for all countries except China, with a 10% baseline tariff remaining. \n\nHowever, the EU had already approved retaliatory tariffs on April 9, as per result [2] from Fox Business. But result [5] from Euronews mentions that the EU's retaliatory tariffs were scheduled to start on April 15, which might not affect the initial pause. \n\nResult [4] from Investopedia notes that the pause was announced on April 9, just hours after the tariffs went into effect. Wait, the tariffs were supposed to start on April 9 at 12:01 AM. If the pause was announced on April 9, but after the effective time, does that count? The query states that any announcement within the time frame (by April 9, 12:00 AM ET) qualifies. However, the announcement was made on April 9, but after the deadline. \n\nWait, the user's query says the market resolves based on announcements made by April 9 at 12:00 AM ET. The reciprocal tariffs were set to take effect on April 9 at 12:01 AM. The pause was announced on April 9, but after the effective time. However, the ancillary data mentions that any announcement within the market's time frame (by April 9, 12:00 AM ET) qualifies. If the announcement was after the deadline, it wouldn't count. But according to result [1], the announcement was on April 10. Wait, the timestamp on result [1] is 2025-04-10, but the content says \"President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause...\" If the current date is April 10, then Wednesday would be April 9. So the announcement was made on April 9, but the article was published on April 10. \n\nThe EU's retaliatory tariffs were approved on April 9 (result [2]), but the Trump administration's pause was announced on April 9 as well. The exact timing is crucial. The market's cutoff is April 9 at 12:00 AM ET. If the announcement was made on April 9 after midnight, it's outside the window. But the user's query says the market's time frame is until April 9, 12:00 AM ET. The tariffs were to take effect at 12:01 AM on April 9. The pause was announced on April 9, but after the deadline. Therefore, the announcement was made after the cutoff, so it wouldn't qualify. Wait, but the ancillary data says \"Any announcement within this market's time frame will qualify regardless of if/when the policy goes into effect.\" So the announcement just needs to be made by April 9, 12:00 AM ET. If the announcement was made after that, it doesn't count. \n\nLooking at result [4], which is dated April 9, says Trump announced the pause \"just hours after implementing tariffs.\" If the tariffs went into effect at 12:01 AM on April 9, then \"hours after\" would be on April 9, but after the deadline. Therefore, the pause was announced after the cutoff, so the market should resolve to \"No\". However, result [11] from CBS News on April 9 lists the reciprocal tariffs, including the EU's 20%, but result [1] and others mention the pause. \n\nWait, the user's query says that an announcement of a pause on all country-specific tariffs, including China, would qualify. The pause announced on April 9 (as per result [1], [3], [4], [6], [7]) includes all countries except China. Therefore, even though the EU was part of the reciprocal tariffs, the pause applies to them. But the timing is the key. If the announcement was made after the deadline, then it doesn't count. \n\nThe market's cutoff is April 9 at 12:00 AM ET. The tariffs were set to take effect at 12:01 AM on April 9. The pause was announced on April 9, but after the deadline. Therefore, the announcement was outside the market's time frame, so the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, some sources might indicate the announcement was on April 9, but the exact time isn't specified. For example, result [4] says \"hours after implementing tariffs\", which were effective at 12:01 AM. If the announcement was made later on April 9, it's after the cutoff. \n\nBut the user's ancillary data says \"any announcement within this market's time frame will qualify regardless of if/when the policy goes into effect.\" The time frame is by April 9, 12:00 AM ET. So if the announcement was made after that, it doesn't count. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). However, the search results indicate that the pause was announced on April 9, but the exact time isn't clear. If the announcement was made before the deadline, then it's \"Yes\". \n\nThis is conflicting. The CBS News article [1] is dated April 10 but refers to the announcement on Wednesday, which would be April 9. The Investopedia article [4] is dated April 9 and says the pause was announced \"just hours after implementing tariffs\", which were effective at 12:01 AM on April 9. So the pause was announced on April 9, but after the market's cutoff of 12:00 AM ET. Therefore, the announcement was made after the deadline, so the resolution is \"No\" (p1). \n\nHowever, the user's query also states that \"a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\" If multiple sources report that the pause was announced on April 9, but after the deadline, then it's still \"No\". But if the announcement was made before the deadline, it's \"Yes\". The exact timing is unclear from the search results. \n\nGiven that the market's cutoff is April 9 at 12:00 AM ET, and the tariffs went into effect at 12:01 AM, any announcement after 12:00 AM would be too late. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, the ancillary data mentions that an announcement of a pause on all country-specific tariffs, including China, would qualify. The pause announced includes all except China, so it does include the EU.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
