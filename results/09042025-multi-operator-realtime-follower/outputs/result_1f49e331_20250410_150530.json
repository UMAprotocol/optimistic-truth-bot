  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744297342 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 15:02:22 UTC",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Vachier-Lagrave vs. Caruana quarterfinal match in the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Paris. The current date is April 10, 2025, and the event's quarterfinals started on April 8th. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The search results mention that the quarterfinals began on April 8th, with the second game scheduled for April 9th. Since today is April 10th, the matches should have concluded. \n\nLooking at the sources, result [3] states that in the quarterfinals, only Carlsen won his first game against Abdusattorov, while the other three games, including Vachier-Lagrave vs. Caruana, ended in draws. The second game was scheduled for the next day (April 9th). Source [8] mentions that each knockout match consists of two classical games, and if tied, they proceed to tiebreaks. \n\nResult [7] shows a specific game between Caruana and Vachier-Lagrave on April 8th ending in a draw. However, there's no direct mention of the second game's result. But source [13], a video recap from April 9th, indicates that Caruana made it to the quarterfinals, and the final standings after the round-robin had Vachier-Lagrave in third place. \n\nSince the match was a two-game classical series, and the first game was a draw, the second game's result is crucial. If they drew again, they would go to tiebreaks. However, none of the sources explicitly state the outcome of the second game or tiebreaks. But source [3] mentions that Caruana's game against Vachier-Lagrave ended in a draw, and the second game was to be played on the 9th. Without further info, but considering the current date is the 10th, it's possible the match concluded. \n\nHowever, the user's ancillary data specifies that if the game is postponed, the market remains open. Since the event dates are in the past and no postponement is mentioned, we assume the match occurred. Given the lack of explicit results for the second game, but knowing that both players advanced to the knockout stage (source [8]), it's possible that one of them won the second game or tiebreaks. \n\nWait, source [8] lists the quarterfinal participants as Carlsen, Nepomniachtchi, Vachier-Lagrave, Erigaisi, Abdusattorov, Nakamura, Keymer, and Caruana. Both Vachier-Lagrave and Caruana are in the quarterfinals, so their match must have concluded. However, without explicit results, it's challenging. But source [3] says only Carlsen won his first game, others drew. The second game's result isn't provided, but in the absence of info, perhaps the match went to tiebreaks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial report in [3] was after the first game, and the second game's result isn't covered in the provided sources. Since the user's timestamp is April 10th, and the second game was on the 9th, but the latest source is from April 9th, it's possible the result isn't available here. However, the market resolution requires a definitive answer. \n\nGiven the ancillary data, if the event is in the past and no info is available, we assume the most probable outcome. But without explicit results, it's unclear. However, source [13] mentions Caruana made it through, but that's from the round-robin. Wait, in the quarterfinals, the match between Vachier-Lagrave and Caruana: source [8] says MVL picked Caruana as his opponent. The playoff structure is two games, then tiebreaks. \n\nSince the sources don't provide the second game's result, but the event is past, and the user needs a resolution, perhaps the match was decided in tiebreaks. However, without explicit info, the safest resolution is p4 (unknown). But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the match was drawn in both games and tiebreaks, leading to an Armageddon. But without data, it's impossible to confirm. Given the ambiguity, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? \n\nLooking at the players' history, source [11] mentions Caruana defeated Gukesh in the Weissenhaus event. Source [12] discusses a previous game between Caruana and MVL ending in a draw. However, in the current event, without explicit results, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit information in the provided sources about the outcome of the Vachier-Lagrave vs. Caruana quarterfinal match, and the event being in the past, the resolution should be p4 (unknown).

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).
