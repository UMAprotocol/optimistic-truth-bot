  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744295102 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 14:25:02 UTC",

The resolution conditions are based on any federal legislation or executive action by Trump that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Bangladesh by May 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of the tariffs. From the search results, on April 2, 2025, Trump announced a 37% tariff on Bangladeshi goods as part of his reciprocal trade policy [1][5][6][7][8]. This was a significant increase from the previous average of 15% [3][5][7]. However, on April 9, Trump suspended the hiked tariffs for 90 days, reducing them to a 10% baseline, except for China [9][11][12]. This suspension was in response to requests from Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus, who had written to Trump seeking a three-month pause [3][9][12][13].\n\nThe key point here is whether this suspension qualifies as a \"pause\" under the resolution conditions. The 90-day suspension effectively lowers the tariff from 37% to 10%, which meets the criteria of pausing or lowering the tariffs. The action was taken via an executive announcement on Trump's Truth Social platform, which is an official channel [9][12]. Additionally, major news outlets like Prothom Alo and bdnews24.com reported the suspension, providing credible consensus [3][9][12].\n\nIt's important to note that the suspension is specific to Bangladesh and other countries, excluding China, which aligns with the requirement that the action targets the listed country specifically [9][12]. The suspension was enacted within the query's timeframe, as the deadline is May 31, 2025, and the announcement was made on April 9, 2025 [9][12].\n\nTherefore, based on the official announcement and credible news sources, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) because Trump's executive action paused the increased tariffs on Bangladesh within the specified period.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
