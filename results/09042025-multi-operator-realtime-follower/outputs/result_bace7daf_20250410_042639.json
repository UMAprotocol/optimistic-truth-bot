  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744259053 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 04:24:13 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the Phoenix Suns will make the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. First, I need to check the current standings and the team's position.\n\nLooking at the search results, especially [9] and [10], the Suns are 35-44, sitting in 11th place in the Western Conference. They're three games behind the 10th-place Mavericks with three games left. The key point here is that making the playoffs requires securing a top 6 seed or winning the play-in tournament. However, the ancillary data specifies that just reaching the play-in doesn't count; they need to be in the top 16 (top 8 in each conference). \n\nAccording to [9], the Suns need to win all their remaining games and have the Mavericks lose all theirs to get the 10th spot. But even if they make the play-in, they still have to win two games to get the 8th seed. The problem is, the user's note says reaching the play-in doesn't qualify. Wait, no\u2014the note says \"reaching the Play-In Tournament will not qualify as making the Playoffs. To make the Playoffs, a team must earn one of the 16 spots.\" So the 16 spots are the actual playoff teams, not the play-in participants. The play-in is for the 7th and 8th seeds. So if the Suns were to get into the play-in and then win to get the 7th or 8th seed, that would count. But if they lose the play-in, they're out. \n\nBut according to the current situation, the Suns are 11th, so they can't even make the play-in unless they jump to 10th. The Mavericks are 10th at 38-41, Suns at 35-44. With three games left, even if the Suns win all three, they'd be 38-44. The Mavericks have three games too. If the Mavericks lose all three, they'd be 38-44 as well. Then the tiebreaker comes in. The Suns have the head-to-head tiebreaker over Dallas, as per [13]. So if both end up 38-44, Suns get 10th. Then they'd have to play in the play-in, but to make the actual playoffs, they'd need to win two play-in games. However, the market resolves based on making the playoffs (top 8), not the play-in. \n\nBut wait, the ancillary data says: \"To make the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs, a team must earn one of the 16 spots in the postseason bracket.\" The NBA playoffs have 16 teams (8 from each conference). The play-in determines the 7th and 8th seeds. So if the Suns make the play-in and then win to get the 7th or 8th seed, they make the playoffs. But if they lose the play-in, they don't. However, the current query is whether they make the playoffs at all. \n\nBut according to the search results, the Suns are 11th, three games behind 10th. Wait, no\u2014[9] says the Suns are 35-44, three games behind Dallas (38-41) with three left. So if Suns win all three, they're 38-44. Dallas has three games: if they lose all, they're 38-44. Then Suns get 10th via tiebreaker. Then they enter the play-in. To make the playoffs, they need to win two play-in games. But the market resolves based on whether they make the playoffs, not the play-in. So even if they get to the play-in, they still have to win to get the 7th or 8th seed. \n\nBut the user's query is whether they make the playoffs, which requires being in the top 8. The play-in is a path to get there, but it's not guaranteed. However, the market resolution condition says if they are mathematically eliminated from the play-in, it resolves to No. According to [9], the Suns are not yet mathematically eliminated, but it's nearly impossible. The resolution condition states that if it's impossible to make the playoffs (including via play-in), resolve to No. \n\nWait, the note says: \"If at any point it becomes impossible for this team to make the Playoffs based on the rules of the NBA (e.g., they are mathematically eliminated from reaching the Play-In), this market will resolve immediately to 'No'.\" So if they can't even reach the play-in, then it's No. But if they can reach the play-in, then there's still a chance, albeit slim. \n\nAs of April 10, 2025 (current date), the Suns are 35-44, three games behind Dallas (38-41) with three games left. They need to win all three, and Dallas must lose all three. Then they get 10th, play-in. But if Dallas wins even one game, Suns can't catch up. So the Suns' fate depends on Dallas's results. \n\nLooking at Dallas's schedule from [9], they play Lakers (48-31), Raptors (29-50), and Grizzlies (47-32). The Lakers and Grizzlies are fighting for playoff position, so they might not rest players. The Raptors are eliminated. If Dallas loses to Lakers and Grizzlies but beats Raptors, they'd have 39-42, Suns max 38-44. So Suns can't catch them. Therefore, even if Suns win all three, Dallas needs to lose all three. \n\nBut the Suns have to play Thunder (65-14), Spurs (32-47), and Kings (39-40). Thunder might rest players since they've clinched 1st. Spurs are out. Kings might be fighting. \n\nBut according to [9], the Suns' elimination is imminent. The article states that one more loss or a Dallas win eliminates them. As of the current date (April 10), after the loss to Warriors, the next day's games include Suns vs Thunder and Mavericks vs Lakers. If the Mavericks win against the Lakers, the Suns are eliminated. If the Mavericks lose, the Suns still have a chance if they win their remaining games. \n\nBut the current timestamp is April 10, 4:25 AM UTC. The Mavericks vs Lakers game is on April 10. If the Mavericks win that, the Suns are eliminated. If they lose, the Suns still have a chance. However, the user's query is about resolving the market now. Since the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but the games are yet to be played, we need to check if the event (Suns making playoffs) has already been determined. \n\nWait, the current date is April 10, 2025. The Suns have three games left, and the Mavericks have three games left. The last games are on April 14 (regular season ends). So as of April 10, the outcome is not yet determined. However, the resolution conditions say if it's impossible, resolve to No. But it's still possible, albeit unlikely. \n\nBut the user's personalization instructions say: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The current timestamp is April 10, 2025. The regular season ends around April 14. So the event date (whether Suns make playoffs) is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" \n\nBut the event here is \"Will the Phoenix Suns make the NBA Playoffs?\" which depends on their final standing after the regular season and play-in. The regular season ends on April 14, and the play-in happens after that. Since today is April 10, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, we should return p4. \n\nHowever, the resolution conditions also state that if the team is mathematically eliminated, resolve to No immediately. So we need to check if the Suns are already mathematically eliminated. \n\nMathematical elimination occurs when even if the Suns win all remaining games and the teams ahead lose all theirs, the Suns still can't reach the required position. \n\nThe Suns are 35-44, three games behind Dallas (38-41) with three left. If Suns win all three, they reach 38-44. Dallas has three games: if they lose all, they're 38-44. Then Suns get 10th via tiebreaker. So it's still possible. Therefore, they are not mathematically eliminated yet. Hence, the market can't resolve to No yet. \n\nBut according to [9], one more Suns loss or Dallas win eliminates them. So if the Suns lose their next game (vs Thunder on April 10) or Dallas wins their next game (vs Lakers on April 10), the Suns are eliminated. But as of the current timestamp (April 10, 4:25 AM UTC), those games haven't happened yet. Therefore, the event is still in the future, and the outcome isn't determined. \n\nTherefore, per the personalization rules, since the event is scheduled for a future date (the remaining games and play-in), the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's note says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. But the event isn't in the past; it's ongoing. \n\nWait, the current date is April 10, 2025. The regular season ends on April 14. The play-in is after that. So the final determination of whether the Suns make the playoffs hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, the event is in the future, and we must return p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nIn this case, the event date isn't in the past; it's ongoing. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. \n\nHowever, looking at the search results, especially [9] and [10], the Suns are on a 7-game losing streak, and their chances are almost nonexistent. But according to the rules, unless they're mathematically eliminated, we can't resolve to No. Since they're not yet eliminated, it's p4. \n\nBut wait, the resolution conditions say if it's impossible to make the playoffs, resolve to No. Since it's still possible (though highly unlikely), we can't resolve yet. Therefore, the answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

However, the current query is whether they make the playoffs at all. \n\nBut according to the search results, the Suns are 11th, three games behind 10th. Wait, no\u2014[9] says the Suns are 35-44, three games behind Dallas (38-41) with three left. So if Suns win all three, they're 38-44. Dallas has three games: if they lose all, they're 38-44. Then Suns get 10th via tiebreaker. Then they enter the play-in. To make the playoffs, they need to win two play-in games. But the market resolves based on whether they make the playoffs, not the play-in. So even if they get to the play-in, they still have to win to get the 7th or 8th seed. \n\nBut the user's query is whether they make the playoffs, which requires being in the top 8. The play-in is a path to get there, but it's not guaranteed. However, the market resolution condition says if they are mathematically eliminated from the play-in, it resolves to No. According to [9], the Suns are not yet mathematically eliminated, but it's nearly impossible. The resolution condition states that if it's impossible to make the playoffs (including via play-in), resolve to No. \n\nWait, the note says: \"If at any point it becomes impossible for this team to make the Playoffs based on the rules of the NBA (e.g., they are mathematically eliminated from reaching the Play-In), this market will resolve immediately to 'No'.\" So if they can't even reach the play-in, then it's No. But if they can reach the play-in, then there's still a chance, albeit slim. \n\nAs of April 10, 2025 (current date), the Suns are 35-44, three games behind Dallas (38-41) with three games left. They need to win all three, and Dallas must lose all three. Then they get 10th, play-in. But if Dallas wins even one game, Suns can't catch up. So the Suns' fate depends on Dallas's results. \n\nLooking at Dallas's schedule from [9], they play Lakers (48-31), Raptors (29-50), and Grizzlies (47-32). The Lakers and Grizzlies are fighting for playoff position, so they might not rest players. The Raptors are eliminated. If Dallas loses to Lakers and Grizzlies but beats Raptors, they'd have 39-42, Suns max 38-44. So Suns can't catch them. Therefore, even if Suns win all three, Dallas needs to lose all three. \n\nBut the Suns have to play Thunder (65-14), Spurs (32-47), and Kings (39-40). Thunder might rest players since they've clinched 1st. Spurs are out. Kings might be fighting. \n\nBut according to [9], the Suns' elimination is imminent. The article states that one more loss or a Dallas win eliminates them. As of the current date (April 10), after the loss to Warriors, the next day's games include Suns vs Thunder and Mavericks vs Lakers. If the Mavericks win against the Lakers, the Suns are eliminated. If the Mavericks lose, the Suns still have a chance if they win their remaining games. \n\nBut the current timestamp is April 10, 4:25 AM UTC. The Mavericks vs Lakers game is on April 10. If the Mavericks win that, the Suns are eliminated. If they lose, the Suns still have a chance. However, the user's query is about resolving the market now. Since the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but the games are yet to be played, we need to check if the event (Suns making playoffs) has already been determined. \n\nWait, the current date is April 10, 2025. The Suns have three games left, and the Mavericks have three games left. The last games are on April 14 (regular season ends). So as of April 10, the outcome is not yet determined. However, the resolution conditions say if it's impossible, resolve to No. But it's still possible, albeit unlikely. \n\nBut the user's personalization instructions say: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The current timestamp is April 10, 2025. The regular season ends around April 14. So the event date (whether Suns make playoffs) is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" \n\nBut the event here is \"Will the Phoenix Suns make the NBA Playoffs?\" which depends on their final standing after the regular season and play-in. The regular season ends on April 14, and the play-in happens after that. Since today is April 10, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, we should return p4. \n\nHowever, the resolution conditions also state that if the team is mathematically eliminated, resolve to No immediately. So we need to check if the Suns are already mathematically eliminated. \n\nMathematical elimination occurs when even if the Suns win all remaining games and the teams ahead lose all theirs, the Suns still can't reach the required position. \n\nThe Suns are 35-44, three games behind Dallas (38-41) with three left. If Suns win all three, they reach 38-44. Dallas has three games: if they lose all, they're 38-44. Then Suns get 10th via tiebreaker. So it's still possible. Therefore, they are not mathematically eliminated yet. Hence, the market can't resolve to No yet. \n\nBut according to [9], one more Suns loss or Dallas win eliminates them. So if the Suns lose their next game (vs Thunder on April 10) or Dallas wins their next game (vs Lakers on April 10), the Suns are eliminated. But as of the current timestamp (April 10, 4:25 AM UTC), those games haven't happened yet. Therefore, the event is still in the future, and the outcome isn't determined. \n\nTherefore, per the personalization rules, since the event is scheduled for a future date (the remaining games and play-in), the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's note says if the event is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. But the event isn't in the past; it's ongoing. \n\nWait, the current date is April 10, 2025. The regular season ends on April 14. The play-in is after that. So the final determination of whether the Suns make the playoffs hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, the event is in the future, and we must return p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nIn this case, the event date isn't in the past; it's ongoing. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. \n\nHowever, looking at the search results, especially [9] and [10], the Suns are on a 7-game losing streak, and their chances are almost nonexistent. But according to the rules, unless they're mathematically eliminated, we can't resolve to No. Since they're not yet eliminated, it's p4. \n\nBut wait, the resolution conditions say if it's impossible to make the playoffs, resolve to No. Since it's still possible (though highly unlikely), we can't resolve yet. Therefore, the answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The code checks if the team is within the top 16 playoff ranks, which aligns with the query requirements. However, the code execution resulted in a 'p4' recommendation, indicating it is too early to resolve. This outcome suggests that either the data was not available or an error occurred during data retrieval or processing. The code includes error handling and logging, which is good practice. However, the market data strongly favors a 'No' outcome with a confidence of 99.95%, which contradicts the solver's 'p4' recommendation. This discrepancy indicates that the solver's output may not be reliable or the market has access to more conclusive data.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744259053 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 04:24:13 UTC",
