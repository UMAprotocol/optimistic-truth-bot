  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744249670 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 01:47:50 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Tampa Bay Lightning game on April 9, 2025. The current date is April 10, 2025, so the game has already happened. I need to determine who won to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. There are several sources here. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at result [1], it's a box score from Fox Sports dated April 9, 2025. The title mentions Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Tampa Bay Lightning, and the score is listed as 3-1. Wait, but the details in the text mention Matthews scoring a goal and an assist in a 3-1 win over the Kings on Saturday. Hmm, that might be a different game. The matchup here is between the Maple Leafs and Lightning, but the description seems mixed. Maybe a typo? The team stats show Toronto leading in some categories, but the actual game result isn't clear here.\n\nResult [2] from SI.com states that the Maple Leafs are 3-0 against the Lightning this season and mentions the upcoming game. But since the game date is April 9, and this article is from the same day, it doesn't have the result yet.\n\nResult [4] from iHeartRadio has a prediction of Lightning 4, Maple Leafs 2. But predictions aren't results. However, the article also includes a section titled \"Lightning vs. Maple Leafs Game Time and TV Channel\" which lists the date as April 9, 2025, but no actual score.\n\nResult [5] is a YouTube video titled \"Tampa Bay Lightning vs Toronto Maple Leafs 4/9/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The transcript mentions a 3-1 lead for the Lightning at one point, and later a final score of 3-1. Wait, the transcript says \"the score 3-1 the Leafs get a hold of the draw...\" and later \"empty net you got to anticipate...\" but it's a bit confusing. However, the video title includes the date, and the transcript snippets suggest the Lightning might have won 3-1. But I need to confirm.\n\nResult [8] from CBS Sports has a box score link, but the content mentions the Lightning's previous game against the Rangers and the Maple Leafs' loss to the Panthers. The article is from April 9 but doesn't provide the final score of the Leafs vs. Lightning game.\n\nResult [10] from Yardbarker mentions the game on April 9 as a key matchup but doesn't give the result, only that both teams have clinched playoffs.\n\nResult [13] from Markerzone has a detailed box score showing the final score as Maple Leafs 3, Lightning 3 in overtime, but the summary shows the Lightning winning in overtime? Wait, the table says FINAL (OT) with the Maple Leafs at 3 and Lightning at 3, but the period breakdown shows the Lightning scoring in OT. Wait, looking closer: the summary under \"3RD PERIOD\" lists goals by both teams, leading to a 3-3 tie, then in OT, no goals are shown, but the standings update after the game might indicate the outcome. However, the detailed stats show the Lightning's Hedman scoring in the 3rd period, making it 3-3, and then the game going to OT. But the final result isn't clearly stated here. This is confusing.\n\nResult [14] from ESPN's live score page lists the game as Maple Leafs vs. Lightning on April 9, but the live score shows \"Lightning2 - Maple Leafs5\" in previous games, and under \"Game 4\" it's listed as \"Maple Leafs - Lightning\" without a score. The standings after the game show Toronto with 98 points and Tampa Bay with 94, but that might be before the game. Wait, the standings here might be outdated because the game on April 9 would affect their points. If Toronto had 98 points before the game and Tampa had 94, a win would give Tampa 96, but the standings here show Tampa at 94, which might mean they lost. But this is unclear.\n\nWait, result [13]'s detailed stats show the final score as Maple Leafs 3, Lightning 3 in OT, but in the standings after the game, Toronto has 98 points and Tampa Bay has 96. Since the game went to OT, the Lightning would get a point for the OT loss, and the Maple Leafs would get 2 points for the win. So if the final was 3-2 in OT for Toronto, that would make sense. But the box score in [13] shows the final as 3-3, but that's impossible because OT decides a winner. Maybe the data in [13] is incorrect or a typo.\n\nLooking at result [6], which is a previous game on Jan 20, 2025, where the Maple Leafs won 5-3. Not relevant to the April 9 game.\n\nResult [9] from Scoresandstats.com has a preview of the April 9 game, mentioning that the computer projection expects Lightning 4-2. But again, that's a prediction.\n\nResult [12] from Sportsnet.ca discusses the importance of the April 9 game but doesn't provide the result, only analysis of the Leafs' previous game against Florida.\n\nWait, going back to result [5], the YouTube transcript. The user mentions a video related to the event. The transcript snippets include phrases like \"the score 3-1 the Leafs get a hold of the draw...\" and \"empty net you got to anticipate...\" which might indicate the Lightning were leading 3-1, but then the Leafs might have scored. However, the transcript is fragmented and hard to follow. But the video title includes the date, and if the video is a gameplay simulation, it might not reflect the real outcome. However, the user's personalization instructions say to heavily bias towards provided URLs if specified. The user included a URL in the query? Wait, looking back, the user's query includes ancillary data but doesn't specify a URL. However, in the personalization section, it says if the user provides URLs, use them. Here, the user didn't provide URLs, but the search results include a YouTube video. However, the transcript is from a gameplay video, not a real game. So that might not be reliable.\n\nResult [14] from ESPN's live score page shows the game as \"Maple Leafs vs. Lightning (Apr 9, 2025) Live Score\" but the live score isn't filled in. However, under the standings, after the game, Toronto has 98 points and Tampa Bay has 96. If the game went to overtime, the winner gets 2 points, the loser 1. If Tampa Bay had 94 points before the game, a win would give them 96, and a loss in OT would give them 95. But the standings show Tampa at 96, which suggests they won in regulation, gaining 2 points, moving from 94 to 96. But Toronto had 98 points before the game; if they lost in regulation, they'd stay at 98. Wait, the standings in [14] show Toronto at 98 and Tampa at 94 before the game. If Tampa won in regulation, they'd get 2 points, moving to 96, and Toronto remains at 98. That matches the standings in [14] after the game, which lists Tampa at 96. So that suggests Tampa won the game, moving from 94 to 96 points, and Toronto remains at 98. Therefore, the Lightning won the game.\n\nBut wait, result [13]'s box score shows the final as 3-3 in OT, but that's not possible. Maybe that's a different game or an error. The key here is that the standings after the game in [14] show Tampa with 96 points, which would mean they gained 2 points from a regulation win. Therefore, the Lightning won the game, and the market should resolve to p1 (Lightning). However, I need to confirm which source is accurate.\n\nAnother angle: result [8] from CBS Sports includes a box score link, but the content mentions the Lightning's previous game against the Rangers and the Maple Leafs' loss to the Panthers. The article states, \"The Maple Leafs (47-26-4, 98 points) have scored five goals in each victory.\" But this is a preview, not the result.\n\nThe most concrete evidence is result",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Tampa Bay Lightning game on April 9, 2025. The key here is to determine who won the game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-10 01:47:50 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time on April 9 at 7:00 PM ET. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to find the final score from reliable sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [5] from Fox Sports provides a box score. It mentions Knies scored a goal assisted by Matthews and Marner, making it TOR 2 TB 0. Wait, that seems like a partial score. Let me check other sources. Result [1] is a YouTube video titled \"Tampa Bay Lightning vs Toronto Maple Leafs 4/9/2025...\" The transcript mentions a 3-1 lead for Tampa Bay at one point and later refers to a \"comfortable lead\" with an empty net situation. That suggests Tampa Bay might have won, but the exact final score isn't clear here.\n\nResult [2] from iHeartRadio has a prediction of Lightning 4, Maple Leafs 2. But predictions aren't actual results. However, result [5]'s box score shows Toronto leading 2-0 at some point, but maybe that's just a part of the game. Wait, the Fox Sports page might have real-time updates. Let me look again. The box score under \"LEADING SCORERS\" lists Nylander with 44 goals and 82 points for Toronto, and Point with 41 goals and 79 points for Tampa. But that's season stats, not the game. The actual game score might be in the play-by-play section. The transcript from [1] mentions a 3-1 lead for Tampa Bay and later an empty net situation, which often leads to a final goal. If the final was 4-2, that aligns with the prediction in [2], but I need confirmation.\n\nResult [6] from Scores and Stats mentions Toronto's previous game but not the Tampa game. Result [5] on Fox Sports might have the live score, but the data is unclear. The YouTube transcript in [1] has timestamps and mentions a 3-1 lead, then later a \"comfortable lead\" with an empty net. If Tampa had a 3-1 lead and scored an empty netter, that would make it 4-1. But the user's additional instructions say to confirm the final score from official sources. The Fox Sports box score in [5] shows under \"SCORE\" that Knies scored a goal making it TOR 2 TB 0, but that might be a snippet from a different part of the game. The confusion here is that the actual final score isn't explicitly stated in any of the sources except maybe the YouTube transcript, which isn't an official source.\n\nWait, the YouTube video in [1] is titled as gameplay from NHL 25, which is a video game. So that's a simulated game, not the real one. That means the transcript from [1] is from a video game simulation and not the actual match. So that source is invalid for real-world results. Therefore, I should disregard [1] and [8] (another YouTube video) as they are simulations or previews.\n\nLooking back, result [5] from Fox Sports has a box score, but it's unclear if it's the actual game. The page lists the date as April 9, 2025, and under \"SCORE,\" it shows \"Knies scored a goal, assisted by A. Matthews and M. Marner. TOR 2 TB 0.\" But that might be a period score, not the final. Without explicit confirmation from an official NHL source or a verified sports news site, it's challenging. The user's additional instructions say to use the provided URLs and bias towards them. The only URL that might have the score is [5], but it's ambiguous. The prediction in [2] says Lightning 4-2, but that's a prediction. The actual result isn't clearly provided in any of the search results. \n\nSince the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found in the sources, per the user's instructions, if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Lightning win, p2 as Maple Leafs. Given the sources don't confirm the result, but the computer prediction in [2] says Lightning 4-2, and the user instructions say to default to p4 if unresolved. However, the user also says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without official confirmation, it's risky. However, the Fox Sports box score in [5] might indicate Toronto scored 2 goals, but it's unclear. Since all sources except the video game simulation don't provide the final score, and the user requires direct confirmation, I have to conclude that there's no verifiable information. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4 as per the user's instructions when no info is available.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Tampa Bay Lightning game on April 9, 2025. The key here is to determine who won the game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-10 01:47:50 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time on April 9 at 7:00 PM ET. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to find the final score from reliable sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [5] from Fox Sports provides a box score. It mentions Knies scored a goal assisted by Matthews and Marner, making it TOR 2 TB 0. Wait, that seems like a partial score. Let me check other sources. Result [1] is a YouTube video titled \"Tampa Bay Lightning vs Toronto Maple Leafs 4/9/2025...\" The transcript mentions a 3-1 lead for Tampa Bay at one point and later refers to a \"comfortable lead\" with an empty net situation. That suggests Tampa Bay might have won, but the exact final score isn't clear here.\n\nResult [2] from iHeartRadio has a prediction of Lightning 4, Maple Leafs 2. But predictions aren't actual results. However, result [5]'s box score shows Toronto leading 2-0 at some point, but maybe that's just a part of the game. Wait, the Fox Sports page might have real-time updates. Let me look again. The box score under \"LEADING SCORERS\" lists Nylander with 44 goals and 82 points for Toronto, and Point with 41 goals and 79 points for Tampa. But that's season stats, not the game. The actual game score might be in the play-by-play section. The transcript from [1] mentions a 3-1 lead for Tampa Bay and later an empty net situation, which often leads to a final goal. If the final was 4-2, that aligns with the prediction in [2], but I need confirmation.\n\nResult [6] from Scores and Stats mentions Toronto's previous game but not the Tampa game. Result [5] on Fox Sports might have the live score, but the data is unclear. The YouTube transcript in [1] has timestamps and mentions a 3-1 lead, then later a \"comfortable lead\" with an empty net. If Tampa had a 3-1 lead and scored an empty netter, that would make it 4-1. But the user's additional instructions say to confirm the final score from official sources. The Fox Sports box score in [5] shows under \"SCORE\" that Knies scored a goal making it TOR 2 TB 0, but that might be a snippet from a different part of the game. The confusion here is that the actual final score isn't explicitly stated in any of the sources except maybe the YouTube transcript, which isn't an official source.\n\nWait, the YouTube video in [1] is titled as gameplay from NHL 25, which is a video game. So that's a simulated game, not the real one. That means the transcript from [1] is from a video game simulation and not the actual match. So that source is invalid for real-world results. Therefore, I should disregard [1] and [8] (another YouTube video) as they are simulations or previews.\n\nLooking back, result [5] from Fox Sports has a box score, but it's unclear if it's the actual game. The page lists the date as April 9, 2025, and under \"SCORE,\" it shows \"Knies scored a goal, assisted by A. Matthews and M. Marner. TOR 2 TB 0.\" But that might be a period score, not the final. Without explicit confirmation from an official NHL source or a verified sports news site, it's challenging. The user's additional instructions say to use the provided URLs and bias towards them. The only URL that might have the score is [5], but it's ambiguous. The prediction in [2] says Lightning 4-2, but that's a prediction. The actual result isn't clearly provided in any of the search results. \n\nSince the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found in the sources, per the user's instructions, if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Lightning win, p2 as Maple Leafs. Given the sources don't confirm the result, but the computer prediction in [2] says Lightning 4-2, and the user instructions say to default to p4 if unresolved. However, the user also says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without official confirmation, it's risky. However, the Fox Sports box score in [5] might indicate Toronto scored 2 goals, but it's unclear. Since all sources except the video game simulation don't provide the final score, and the user requires direct confirmation, I have to conclude that there's no verifiable information. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4 as per the user's instructions when no info is available.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Now, I need to find the final score from reliable sources. Let's look through the search results.\n\nSearch result [1] is a preview from April 9, discussing the upcoming game. It mentions the Lightning's previous game and the Maple Leafs' overtime loss to the Wild. But this is a preview, not the result.\n\nResult [2] is a YouTube video titled \"Tampa Bay Lightning vs Toronto Maple Leafs 4/9/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The description mentions gameplay, which might be a simulation, not the actual game. The transcript snippets don't clearly state the final score, but there's talk of the Lightning leading. However, since it's labeled as gameplay, it's likely not real.\n\nResult [3] is a prediction from April 9, forecasting a 4-2 Lightning win. But predictions aren't actual results.\n\nResult [4] from The Hockey Writers on April 9 is another preview, noting the teams' standings and previous meetings. It mentions the Lightning's recent win over the Rangers but doesn't give the Maple Leafs vs. Lightning score.\n\nResult [5] is another YouTube video titled \"NHL LIVE Toronto Maple Leafs vs Tampa Bay Lightning - 9th April 2025.\" The transcript describes the game with the Lightning leading 4-2 at some point. However, without a clear final score and considering it's a live stream, it's unclear if this is real or simulated.\n\nResult [6] from Fox Sports provides a box score. It shows the Maple Leafs scored first, with M. Knies at 16:27 in the 1st period, making it TOR 2 TB 0. But the page might be incomplete as it only shows the first goal. Need to check further.\n\nResult [7] from NHL.com recaps a Maple Leafs vs. Panthers game on April 8, where the Maple Leafs lost 3-1. It mentions they were to play the Lightning next on April 9 but doesn't provide that game's result.\n\nResult [8] from Sportskeeda on April 9 is another preview, giving stats and predictions but no actual result.\n\nThe key source here is result [6], the Fox Sports box score. It lists the first goal by M. Knies, assisted by Matthews and Marner, making it 2-0 Maple Leafs. However, the box score might not be fully updated. If this is the complete game, the Maple Leafs won 2-0. But other sources like [5] suggest a Lightning lead. However, [5] is a YouTube video which might not be reliable. \n\nWait, result [6] shows \"TOR 2 TB 0\" as the first goal, but the rest of the box score isn't visible. Without more data, this is inconclusive. The user's additional instructions emphasize checking official NHL sources. The NHL.com recap in [7] doesn't mention the April 9 game's result, only the April 8 game. \n\nSince the current date is April 10, the game has occurred. The most reliable source would be an official NHL report or a credible sports site. The lack of a clear result in the provided sources complicates things. However, result [6] indicates a Maple Leafs goal, but without the full game data, it's hard to confirm. \n\nGiven the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info exists, but the ancillary data says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The prediction in [3] suggested Lightning 4-2, but predictions aren't facts. \n\nWait, result [5]'s transcript mentions the Lightning leading 4-2, but it's a YouTube video titled as gameplay, which might be a simulation. Without confirmation from an official source, it's risky to rely on that. \n\nSince the user requires direct confirmation from official sources and none are present in the search results, but the Fox Sports box score [6] shows a Maple Leafs goal, perhaps the game ended in their favor. However, without the full final score, this is uncertain. \n\nIn the absence of clear, official confirmation, but considering the user's instruction to default to the most probable outcome if the event date has passed and no info is available, and given the Maple Leafs had won the previous three meetings, maybe they won again. However, the prediction in [3] had Lightning winning. \n\nThis is conflicting. Without an official source, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Maple Leafs win. If the most probable outcome based on previous games (Maple Leafs 3-0 against Lightning this season), maybe they won. But without official confirmation, it's a guess. \n\nWait, the user's additional instructions say to focus on official NHL reports or verified sports sites.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744249670 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 01:47:50 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744249670 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 01:47:50 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please focus on obtaining and confirming the final score from the most reliable and direct sources available, such as official NHL reports or verified sports news websites. Avoid relying on inferred data like standings or points without direct confirmation of the game results. Confirm the final score explicitly."
