  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744214849 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-09 16:07:29 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price went up or down between April 8th and 9th, 2025, specifically comparing the closing prices at noon ET each day on Binance's BTCUSDT pair. The resolution depends on the close prices of the 1-minute candles at those times.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 9, 2025, 4:09 PM UTC. Since the event in question is about April 9th at noon ET, which is 12:00 PM Eastern Time. I need to convert that to UTC to see if the event has already occurred. Eastern Time is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so noon ET on April 9th would be 16:00 UTC (4 PM UTC). The current time is 4:09 PM UTC, which is just after the event time. So the data should be available now.\n\nNext, I need to look at the provided search results to find the closing prices for both days. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Search Result [1]**: From April 8th, mentions Bitcoin struggling below $79,200 and later consolidating between $77,300 and $80,500. The price prediction for April 8th indicates a bearish tilt but doesn't give the exact noon ET price.\n\n2. **Search Result [4]**: On April 8th at 11:59 AM UTC, Bitcoin crossed 80,000 USDT. However, this is just before noon ET (which is 16:00 UTC). The exact noon ET candle close on April 8th might be around this time, but the time zones need careful consideration.\n\n3. **Search Result [5]**: On April 8th at 1:00 AM UTC, Bitcoin dropped below 79,000 USDT. This is earlier in the day, so not directly relevant to the noon ET time.\n\n4. **Search Result [12]**: On April 8th at 16:23 PM UTC, Bitcoin dropped below 78,000 USDT. Since noon ET on April 8th is 16:00 UTC, the 16:23 PM UTC data is after the relevant time. However, the 1-minute candle at 16:00 UTC (noon ET) would be the critical point. The price at 16:00 UTC on April 8th might be around 80,000 USDT based on [4], which reported crossing 80k at 11:59 AM UTC, but that's 4 hours earlier. There's a discrepancy here because the time zones might be causing confusion.\n\nWait, the user specified noon ET for both days. April 8th noon ET is 16:00 UTC, and April 9th noon ET is also 16:00 UTC. The current time is April 9th, 16:09 UTC, which is just after the second data point. So the closing price for April 9th at noon ET should be available now.\n\nLooking at search result [3], from April 9th, it states Bitcoin is trading at $75,192 after a sell-off. This is dated April 9th, and the price is significantly lower than the previous day's highs. However, the exact closing price at 16:00 UTC (noon ET) on April 9th needs to be pinpointed.\n\nSearch result [10] provides a live price chart as of the current time, showing the last traded price around $82,635.56. However, this might be the real-time data at the moment of the search, not the specific 16:00 UTC candle close. There's a risk here because the live data might not exactly match the 1-minute candle close at 16:00 UTC.\n\nAnother angle: The ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1m candles. Since the current time is just after 16:00 UTC on April 9th, the 1-minute candle for 16:00 UTC should have closed, and the price at that exact minute is needed.\n\nLooking at search result [10], the 24-hour high is listed as 84,720.00 and the low as 81,211.24. The current price shown is 82,635.56, but this might not be the closing price of the specific 16:00 UTC candle. However, given the timestamp of the search results, some of the data might be slightly outdated or not precisely aligned.\n\nWait, search result [3] from April 9th mentions Bitcoin trading at $75,192, which is a significant drop. However, this seems conflicting with other data points. It's possible that different sources are reporting different prices due to varying timestamps or exchanges. The user specifically mentioned Binance's BTCUSDT pair, so we must rely on data from Binance.\n\nSearch result [4] on April 8th at 11:59 AM UTC (which is 7:59 AM ET) shows Bitcoin crossing 80,000 USDT. Then, search result [12] on April 8th at 16:23 PM UTC (12:23 PM ET) reports a drop below 78,000 USDT. The noon ET candle on April 8th would be at 16:00 UTC, so the 16:23 PM UTC data is after that. The closing price at 16:00 UTC on April 8th might be around 78,000 USDT, considering the price was dropping around that time.\n\nOn April 9th, the current data from search result [3] indicates a price of $75,192, but this is from a Coinfomania article. However, Binance's own data in search result [10] shows a higher price around $82,635. This discrepancy suggests that different sources might have different prices, but the user specified Binance as the resolution source. Therefore, the Binance data takes precedence.\n\nIn search result [10], the live price chart from Binance shows the last traded price at $82,635.56 as of the current time (16:09 UTC). The 1-minute candle for 16:00 UTC would have a closing price. Assuming that the price at 16:00 UTC on April 9th is around this value, and comparing it to the April 8th closing price at 16:00 UTC, which was around 78,000 USDT (from search result [12]), the April 9th price is higher. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Up\" (p2).\n\nHowever, there's a conflict because search result [3] mentions a lower price on April 9th. This could be due to different timestamps or inaccuracies in the sources. Since the user requires Binance's data, the live data from Binance (search result [10]) is more reliable. Therefore, if the closing price on April 9th at noon ET (16:00 UTC) is higher than April 8th's closing price, the resolution is p2 (Up).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price went up or down between April 8th and 9th, 2025, specifically comparing the closing prices at noon ET each day on Binance's BTCUSDT pair. The resolution depends on the close prices of the 1-minute candles at those times.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is April 9, 2025, 4:09 PM UTC. Since the event in question is about April 9th at noon ET, which is 12:00 PM Eastern Time. I need to convert that to UTC to see if the event has already occurred. Eastern Time is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so noon ET on April 9th would be 16:00 UTC (4 PM UTC). The current time is 4:09 PM UTC, which is just after the event time. So the data should be available now.\n\nNext, I need to look at the provided search results to find the closing prices for both days. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Search Result [1]**: From April 8th, mentions Bitcoin struggling below $79,200 and later consolidating between $77,300 and $80,500. The price prediction for April 8th indicates a bearish tilt but doesn't give the exact noon ET price.\n\n2. **Search Result [4]**: On April 8th at 11:59 AM UTC, Bitcoin crossed 80,000 USDT. However, this is just before noon ET (which is 16:00 UTC). The exact noon ET candle close on April 8th might be around this time, but the time zones need careful consideration.\n\n3. **Search Result [5]**: On April 8th at 1:00 AM UTC, Bitcoin dropped below 79,000 USDT. This is earlier in the day, so not directly relevant to the noon ET time.\n\n4. **Search Result [12]**: On April 8th at 16:23 PM UTC, Bitcoin dropped below 78,000 USDT. Since noon ET on April 8th is 16:00 UTC, the 16:23 PM UTC data is after the relevant time. However, the 1-minute candle at 16:00 UTC (noon ET) would be the critical point. The price at 16:00 UTC on April 8th might be around 80,000 USDT based on [4], which reported crossing 80k at 11:59 AM UTC, but that's 4 hours earlier. There's a discrepancy here because the time zones might be causing confusion.\n\nWait, the user specified noon ET for both days. April 8th noon ET is 16:00 UTC, and April 9th noon ET is also 16:00 UTC. The current time is April 9th, 16:09 UTC, which is just after the second data point. So the closing price for April 9th at noon ET should be available now.\n\nLooking at search result [3], from April 9th, it states Bitcoin is trading at $75,192 after a sell-off. This is dated April 9th, and the price is significantly lower than the previous day's highs. However, the exact closing price at 16:00 UTC (noon ET) on April 9th needs to be pinpointed.\n\nSearch result [10] provides a live price chart as of the current time, showing the last traded price around $82,635.56. However, this might be the real-time data at the moment of the search, not the specific 16:00 UTC candle close. There's a risk here because the live data might not exactly match the 1-minute candle close at 16:00 UTC.\n\nAnother angle: The ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1m candles. Since the current time is just after 16:00 UTC on April 9th, the 1-minute candle for 16:00 UTC should have closed, and the price at that exact minute is needed.\n\nLooking at search result [10], the 24-hour high is listed as 84,720.00 and the low as 81,211.24. The current price shown is 82,635.56, but this might not be the closing price of the specific 16:00 UTC candle. However, given the timestamp of the search results, some of the data might be slightly outdated or not precisely aligned.\n\nWait, search result [3] from April 9th mentions Bitcoin trading at $75,192, which is a significant drop. However, this seems conflicting with other data points. It's possible that different sources are reporting different prices due to varying timestamps or exchanges. The user specifically mentioned Binance's BTCUSDT pair, so we must rely on data from Binance.\n\nSearch result [4] on April 8th at 11:59 AM UTC (which is 7:59 AM ET) shows Bitcoin crossing 80,000 USDT. Then, search result [12] on April 8th at 16:23 PM UTC (12:23 PM ET) reports a drop below 78,000 USDT. The noon ET candle on April 8th would be at 16:00 UTC, so the 16:23 PM UTC data is after that. The closing price at 16:00 UTC on April 8th might be around 78,000 USDT, considering the price was dropping around that time.\n\nOn April 9th, the current data from search result [3] indicates a price of $75,192, but this is from a Coinfomania article. However, Binance's own data in search result [10] shows a higher price around $82,635. This discrepancy suggests that different sources might have different prices, but the user specified Binance as the resolution source. Therefore, the Binance data takes precedence.\n\nIn search result [10], the live price chart from Binance shows the last traded price at $82,635.56 as of the current time (16:09 UTC). The 1-minute candle for 16:00 UTC would have a closing price. Assuming that the price at 16:00 UTC on April 9th is around this value, and comparing it to the April 8th closing price at 16:00 UTC, which was around 78,000 USDT (from search result [12]), the April 9th price is higher. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Up\" (p2).\n\nHowever, there's a conflict because search result [3] mentions a lower price on April 9th. This could be due to different timestamps or inaccuracies in the sources. Since the user requires Binance's data, the live data from Binance (search result [10]) is more reliable. Therefore, if the closing price on April 9th at noon ET (16:00 UTC) is higher than April 8th's closing price, the resolution is p2 (Up).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

However, the response contains several inconsistencies and potential errors in interpreting the data. The solver's conclusion that the market should resolve to 'Up' (p2) is based on an assumption about the closing price at 16:00 UTC on April 9th, which is inferred rather than explicitly confirmed from the data source specified (Binance). Additionally, the response does not convincingly reconcile the discrepancy between the reported prices in different search results, leading to potential inaccuracies in the final recommendation. Furthermore, the response does not align with the strong market sentiment, which heavily favors the 'Down' outcome.",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).
