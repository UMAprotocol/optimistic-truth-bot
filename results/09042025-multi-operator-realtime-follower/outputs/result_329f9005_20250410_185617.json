The user is asking whether Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Taiwan by April 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on any federal legislation or executive action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Taiwan. The current date is April 10, 2025, so we need to look at events up to this point.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. Result [2] from April 10 states that Taiwan is among the countries granted a 90-day pause on the additional 22% tariff, leaving the baseline 10% in place. This seems like a pause on part of the tariffs. Result [5] mentions that on April 9, Trump paused the reciprocal tariffs except for China, which aligns with [2]. Result [6] also confirms the 90-day pause, reducing Taiwan's tariff from 32% to 10%. \n\nThe key here is whether the action taken qualifies under the market's conditions. The 22% additional tariff was paused, which is a specific action targeting Taiwan, as per the resolution criteria. The baseline 10% remains, but the pause on the additional portion meets the \"pause\" condition. \n\nSince this action was taken by Trump via executive order (as per [5] and [6]), it's an executive action that pauses part of the tariffs on Taiwan. The effective date is within April, so it meets the timeframe. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9, ID: 91230138537619646010404492404458028350009528547901800560337246614273062985403, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.1, ID: 89903698354254645095458766234757502990516468773579832901968981176733167078842, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.900 = 90.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

The baseline 10% remains, but the pause on the additional portion meets the \"pause\" condition. \n\nSince this action was taken by Trump via executive order (as per [5] and [6]), it's an executive action that pauses part of the tariffs on Taiwan. The effective date is within April, so it meets the timeframe. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9, ID: 91230138537619646010404492404458028350009528547901800560337246614273062985403, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.1, ID: 89903698354254645095458766234757502990516468773579832901968981176733167078842, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.900 = 90.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
