  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744294082 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 14:08:02 UTC",

The ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on any federal legislation or executive action by Trump that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs on South Korean imports by May 31, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 10, 2025. The event in question is whether an action was taken before June 1, 2025. Since the current date is April 10, the event's deadline hasn't passed yet. However, the user is asking for a resolution based on what has already happened up to now. Wait, no\u2014the query is about whether Trump will do it before June, but the current timestamp is April 10. The user is asking for a prediction, but according to the personalization instructions, I should only resolve based on events that have already occurred. If the event is in the future (after April 10), then the answer should be p4. But the deadline is May 31, which is in the future relative to April 10. However, the user's query is phrased as a market that resolves based on actions taken by May 31. Since today is April 10, the event hasn't occurred yet, so the resolution should be p4. Wait, but looking at the search results, there's information about Trump pausing tariffs on South Korea on April 9-10, 2025. Let me check the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, specifically [2], [4], [8], [11], and [13], they mention that on April 9-10, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, reducing South Korea's tariff from 25% to 10%. For example, source [2] states: \"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday paused the implementation of 'reciprocal' tariffs for 90 days and applied a 10 percent baseline tariff to South Korea...\" Source [4] confirms this: \"lowered 'reciprocal' tariffs on South Korea and other trading partners to 10 percent.\" Source [11] also mentions the 90-day pause and the 10% rate. \n\nAccording to the ancillary data, any executive action that lowers or pauses tariffs on South Korea before May 31 would resolve to Yes (p2). Since Trump took this action on April 10, which is within the timeframe (before May 31), the answer should be p2. However, I need to ensure that the action specifically targets South Korea. The sources indicate that South Korea was among the countries affected by the pause, and the tariff was reduced from 25% to 10%. The ancillary data specifies that only actions targeting the listed country (South Korea) count. Since the pause and reduction were applied to South Korea specifically, this meets the condition. \n\nTherefore, even though the event's deadline is in the future (May 31), the action has already occurred on April 10, so the resolution should be p2 (Yes). The personalization instructions say to resolve based on verified facts of events that have already occurred. Since the action happened before the current date (April 10), it's a past event relative to the resolution deadline. Wait, the resolution deadline is May 31, but the action was taken on April 10, which is before May 31. Therefore, the condition is met, and the answer is Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
