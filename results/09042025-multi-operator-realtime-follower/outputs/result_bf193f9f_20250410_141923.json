  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744294595 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 14:16:35 UTC",

The user wants to know if Trump will reduce the majority of tariffs he imposed on April 2, 2025, specifically on 39 out of the 76 listed countries by April 30, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are [1], [10], and [14], which mention that on April 10, Trump announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs, lowering the reciprocal rate to 10% for most countries except China. This pause affects the majority of the listed countries. \n\nLooking at the original announcement on April 2, the reciprocal tariffs were higher than 10% for 76 countries. The April 10 decision lowers these to 10% for 90 days, which would cover 39 countries easily. The EU's rate was initially 20%, and this pause reduces it to 10%, so that's 27 countries right there. Adding others like Japan, South Korea, etc., would reach the 39 threshold.\n\nThe user's query specifies that the 10% general tariff doesn't count, but the pause here is on the reciprocal tariffs above the baseline. Since the reciprocal tariffs were additional, reducing them to the baseline 10% (which is part of the general tariff) might be a point of confusion. However, the resolution conditions state that lowering the reciprocal tariff counts. The April 10 action effectively pauses the higher reciprocal rates, bringing them down to the baseline, which is a reduction of the reciprocal tariffs. \n\nAlso, the action was taken via executive order, which qualifies under the user's criteria. The effective date is within April, so it meets the timeframe. Therefore, the answer should be Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nActions that lower, pause, delay, or remove the general \u00e2\u0080\u0098reciprocal' tariffs on imports from the listed country will qualify, however item specific exceptions or changes to tariffs which are not the general reciprocal tariff will not count.\n\nA reduction in the reciprocal 20% tariff on the EU will count for all 27 countries. A reduction in the reciprocal tariff on a specific EU member state will also count towards the total.\n\nThe removal or reduction of the 10% general tariff on all imports into the U.S. will not qualify.\n\nAny action officially enacted within the market's time frame will qualify, regardless of when the change goes into effect.\n\nThis market's primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration; however, a consensus of credible information from major news outlets or government statements will also be used.",
