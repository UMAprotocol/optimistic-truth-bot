  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744300221 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 15:50:21 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if March 2025 was the hottest March on record according to NASA's GISTEMP data. The resolution depends on the data from the specified NASA table. \n\nFirst, I need to check the release date for March 2025 data. The search results mention that the March release was scheduled for April 10, 2025, at 11:00 AM EDT. The current timestamp is April 10, 2025, 3:50:21 PM UTC, which is after the release time. So the data should be available.\n\nLooking at source [5], the release dates are listed, and March's data was indeed released on April 10. Now, I need to access the specific table mentioned in the query: \"GLOBAL Land-Ocean Temperature Index in 0.01 degrees Celsius\" under the \"Mar\" column. The URL provided is https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt. \n\nAssuming the data has been updated, I should check the March 2025 value. For example, if the March 2025 entry shows a higher value than all previous March entries, then the answer is \"Yes\" (p2). If it's tied or lower, it's \"No\" (p1). \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide the actual March 2025 data point. Source [11] mentions UAH data for March 2025 as +0.58\u00b0C, but that's lower troposphere temperature, not surface. The query specifically requires NASA's GISTEMP data. \n\nSince the data release happened today and the current time is after the scheduled release, but the provided context doesn't include the actual number, I might need to infer. However, the user's personalization instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no data is available but the event date is past. But wait, the data should be available now. \n\nWait, the user provided a URL in the query (ancillary_data) which points to the NASA table. But in the search results, the latest data mentioned is from 2024. Source [6] and [2] confirm 2024 was the hottest year, but March 2025 data isn't directly provided here. \n\nSince the current date is April 10, 2025, and the data was released today, but the provided search results don't include the updated March 2025 value, I can't confirm the exact number. However, the user's instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no data is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nGiven that 2024 was the hottest year and considering ongoing warming trends, it's plausible March 2025 might continue the trend. But without explicit data, the safe resolution is p4 (unknown). However, the user's note says if NASA hasn't provided data by July 1, 2025, use other sources. But today is April 10, and the data was supposed to be released today. If the data isn't in the provided context, perhaps due to the system's cutoff, but in reality, it's available, the assistant should check. \n\nBut since the provided search results don't include the actual March 2025 value from NASA's table, and the user's instructions say to use the provided sources, I can't definitively answer. However, source [15] mentions that the March data was released today. If the data isn't in the context, but the release happened, the resolution should be based on the actual data. Since the assistant can't access live data, but the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no data is available. \n\nBut wait, the event date (March 2025) is in the past, and the data release date (April 10) is today. Since the current timestamp is after the release, but the provided context doesn't include the updated data, the assistant must resolve based on available info. If no data is present, but the release was today, perhaps the data is available but not in the context. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided sources. \n\nIn the absence of the March 2025 data in the provided sources, the assistant should default to p4. But the user's note says if NASA hasn't provided data by July 1, use other sources. Since today is April 10, and the data was released today, but it's not in the context, the assistant can't confirm. Therefore, the resolution is p4. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. Given the warming trend, maybe p2. But this is conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nIn this case, the event date (March 2025) is past, and the data release date is today. If the data isn't in the provided context, but the release happened, the assistant should infer. However, without the actual data point, it's uncertain. But the ancillary data defines p2 as \"Yes\" if March 2025 is higher than all previous March data. \n\nSince the assistant can't access the actual data, but the user's instructions say to resolve based on available info, and the search results don't include the March 2025 value, the assistant must default to p4. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. Given the trend, but without concrete data, it's safer to go with p4. \n\nBut wait, source [11] (UAH data) shows March 2025 as +0.58\u00b0C, which is lower than March 2024's +0.88\u00b0C. However, UAH measures lower troposphere, not surface. The query specifically requires NASA's surface data. So UAH's data isn't directly relevant. \n\nGiven all this, the assistant can't confirm the NASA data from the provided context. Therefore, the resolution is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Given the trend, but without concrete data, it's safer to go with p4. \n\nBut wait, source [11] (UAH data) shows March 2025 as +0.58\u00b0C, which is lower than March 2024's +0.88\u00b0C. However, UAH measures lower troposphere, not surface. The query specifically requires NASA's surface data. So UAH's data isn't directly relevant. \n\nGiven all this, the assistant can't confirm the NASA data from the provided context. Therefore, the resolution is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744300221 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 15:50:21 UTC",
