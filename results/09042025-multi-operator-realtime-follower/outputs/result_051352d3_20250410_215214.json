Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n"

The current date is April 10, 2025, 9:49 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has occurred and what the result was. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the Brewers winning 17-2 on April 9th, but that's the previous game. The query is about the game on April 10th. Wait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 10 at 3:10 PM ET. Let me check the search results again.\n\nSearch result [9] from thescore.com shows a game on April 10th where the Brewers won 2-1. Wait, no, looking closer, the final score in [9] is listed as Brewers 7-5 and Rockies 2-9, but the detailed scoring shows Milwaukee 2 and Colorado 7. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me cross-reference with other sources.\n\nSearch result [12] is a YouTube live stream titled \"LIVE Milwaukee Brewers VS Colorado Rockies - April 10th /MLB THE SHOW 25\", which might indicate the game was played. However, the description in [12] mentions a home run by Yelich, but without a clear final score. \n\nSearch result [11] from CBS Sports provides a preview of the April 10th game, mentioning that the Brewers are aiming for a series sweep. The article states that Quinn Priester is making his debut for Milwaukee, and Ryan Feltner is starting for Colorado. It also notes the Brewers' recent offensive performance. However, this is a preview, not a post-game report.\n\nSearch result [13] from Fox Sports includes a box score for the April 10th game, showing the Brewers with a 5.5 R (runs?) and the Rockies with 3.0, but the detailed box score isn't clear. The probable starting pitchers are listed as Priester and Feltner. The previous games listed show the Brewers won on April 9th and 8th, but the April 10th game's outcome isn't explicitly stated here.\n\nWait, search result [9] on thescore.com has a final score of Brewers 2 and Rockies 7. The detailed scoring shows Milwaukee scoring 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0 (total 2) and Colorado 1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,X (total 7). So the Rockies won 7-2 on April 10th. That would mean the market should resolve to Colorado Rockies (p1). But I need to confirm this with other sources.\n\nLooking at search result [10], the preview mentions the Brewers' record as 7-5 and the Rockies as 2-9 going into the April 10th game. The injury report is also listed. However, this is a preview, not the result.\n\nSearch result [3] from pickdawgz.com has a prediction for the April 10th game, but it's a prediction, not the actual result. Similarly, [2] and [8] are betting previews without post-game data.\n\nSearch result [14] from the-journal.com discusses the April 9th game where the Brewers won 17-2. The \"Up next\" section mentions Ryan Feltner pitching for Colorado on April 10th, but doesn't provide the result.\n\nThe key here is to find a source that explicitly states the outcome of the April 10th game. Search result [9] on thescore.com shows the final score as Brewers 2, Rockies 7. Additionally, the box score in [13] under \"PREVIOUS GAMES\" for MIL lists the April 10th game as a win, but the detailed box score in [9] indicates a Rockies victory. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, in [9], the final score is listed as MIL Brewers 7-5 and COL Rockies 2-9, but the inning-by-inning breakdown shows COL scoring 7 runs. This might be a formatting error. Alternatively, the detailed scoring in [9] shows COL scoring 7 runs (1 in the 1st, 1 in the 7th, 5 in the 8th), totaling 7, while MIL scores 2 (1 in the 4th, 1 in the 8th). Therefore, the Rockies won 7-2. \n\nSince the game was played on April 10th and the Rockies won, the market should resolve to p1 (Colorado Rockies). However, I need to ensure that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Milwaukee Brewers vs. Colorado Rockies game on April 10, 2025, at 3:10 PM ET. The current date is April 10, 2025, 9:49 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has occurred and what the result was. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the Brewers winning 17-2 on April 9th, but that's the previous game. The query is about the game on April 10th. Wait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 10 at 3:10 PM ET. Let me check the search results again.\n\nSearch result [9] from thescore.com shows a game on April 10th where the Brewers won 2-1. Wait, no, looking closer, the final score in [9] is listed as Brewers 7-5 and Rockies 2-9, but the detailed scoring shows Milwaukee 2 and Colorado 7. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me cross-reference with other sources.\n\nSearch result [12] is a YouTube live stream titled \"LIVE Milwaukee Brewers VS Colorado Rockies - April 10th /MLB THE SHOW 25\", which might indicate the game was played. However, the description in [12] mentions a home run by Yelich, but without a clear final score. \n\nSearch result [11] from CBS Sports provides a preview of the April 10th game, mentioning that the Brewers are aiming for a series sweep. The article states that Quinn Priester is making his debut for Milwaukee, and Ryan Feltner is starting for Colorado. It also notes the Brewers' recent offensive performance. However, this is a preview, not a post-game report.\n\nSearch result [13] from Fox Sports includes a box score for the April 10th game, showing the Brewers with a 5.5 R (runs?) and the Rockies with 3.0, but the detailed box score isn't clear. The probable starting pitchers are listed as Priester and Feltner. The previous games listed show the Brewers won on April 9th and 8th, but the April 10th game's outcome isn't explicitly stated here.\n\nWait, search result [9] on thescore.com has a final score of Brewers 2 and Rockies 7. The detailed scoring shows Milwaukee scoring 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0 (total 2) and Colorado 1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,X (total 7). So the Rockies won 7-2 on April 10th. That would mean the market should resolve to Colorado Rockies (p1). But I need to confirm this with other sources.\n\nLooking at search result [10], the preview mentions the Brewers' record as 7-5 and the Rockies as 2-9 going into the April 10th game. The injury report is also listed. However, this is a preview, not the result.\n\nSearch result [3] from pickdawgz.com has a prediction for the April 10th game, but it's a prediction, not the actual result. Similarly, [2] and [8] are betting previews without post-game data.\n\nSearch result [14] from the-journal.com discusses the April 9th game where the Brewers won 17-2. The \"Up next\" section mentions Ryan Feltner pitching for Colorado on April 10th, but doesn't provide the result.\n\nThe key here is to find a source that explicitly states the outcome of the April 10th game. Search result [9] on thescore.com shows the final score as Brewers 2, Rockies 7. Additionally, the box score in [13] under \"PREVIOUS GAMES\" for MIL lists the April 10th game as a win, but the detailed box score in [9] indicates a Rockies victory. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, in [9], the final score is listed as MIL Brewers 7-5 and COL Rockies 2-9, but the inning-by-inning breakdown shows COL scoring 7 runs. This might be a formatting error. Alternatively, the detailed scoring in [9] shows COL scoring 7 runs (1 in the 1st, 1 in the 7th, 5 in the 8th), totaling 7, while MIL scores 2 (1 in the 4th, 1 in the 8th). Therefore, the Rockies won 7-2. \n\nSince the game was played on April 10th and the Rockies won, the market should resolve to p1 (Colorado Rockies). However, I need to ensure that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled.

But I need to confirm this with other sources.\n\nLooking at search result [10], the preview mentions the Brewers' record as 7-5 and the Rockies as 2-9 going into the April 10th game. The injury report is also listed. However, this is a preview, not the result.\n\nSearch result [3] from pickdawgz.com has a prediction for the April 10th game, but it's a prediction, not the actual result. Similarly, [2] and [8] are betting previews without post-game data.\n\nSearch result [14] from the-journal.com discusses the April 9th game where the Brewers won 17-2. The \"Up next\" section mentions Ryan Feltner pitching for Colorado on April 10th, but doesn't provide the result.\n\nThe key here is to find a source that explicitly states the outcome of the April 10th game. Search result [9] on thescore.com shows the final score as Brewers 2, Rockies 7. Additionally, the box score in [13] under \"PREVIOUS GAMES\" for MIL lists the April 10th game as a win, but the detailed box score in [9] indicates a Rockies victory. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, in [9], the final score is listed as MIL Brewers 7-5 and COL Rockies 2-9, but the inning-by-inning breakdown shows COL scoring 7 runs. This might be a formatting error. Alternatively, the detailed scoring in [9] shows COL scoring 7 runs (1 in the 1st, 1 in the 7th, 5 in the 8th), totaling 7, while MIL scores 2 (1 in the 4th, 1 in the 8th). Therefore, the Rockies won 7-2. \n\nSince the game was played on April 10th and the Rockies won, the market should resolve to p1 (Colorado Rockies). However, I need to ensure that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Milwaukee Brewers, Price: 0.0225, ID: 110836313904664742464981492607448473122616430843875534626700770143225307265295, Winner: No\n- Token: Colorado Rockies, Price: 0.9775, ID: 28164154065840286713612326923974641010056974046529858219915855044478366989936, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Colorado Rockies outcome (0.978 = 97.8% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Milwaukee Brewers vs. Colorado Rockies game on April 10, 2025, at 3:10 PM ET. The current date is April 10, 2025, 9:49 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has occurred and what the result was. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the Brewers winning 17-2 on April 9th, but that's the previous game. The query is about the game on April 10th. Wait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 10 at 3:10 PM ET. Let me check the search results again.\n\nSearch result [9] from thescore.com shows a game on April 10th where the Brewers won 2-1. Wait, no, looking closer, the final score in [9] is listed as Brewers 7-5 and Rockies 2-9, but the detailed scoring shows Milwaukee 2 and Colorado 7. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me cross-reference with other sources.\n\nSearch result [12] is a YouTube live stream titled \"LIVE Milwaukee Brewers VS Colorado Rockies - April 10th /MLB THE SHOW 25\", which might indicate the game was played. However, the description in [12] mentions a home run by Yelich, but without a clear final score. \n\nSearch result [11] from CBS Sports provides a preview of the April 10th game, mentioning that the Brewers are aiming for a series sweep. The article states that Quinn Priester is making his debut for Milwaukee, and Ryan Feltner is starting for Colorado. It also notes the Brewers' recent offensive performance. However, this is a preview, not a post-game report.\n\nSearch result [13] from Fox Sports includes a box score for the April 10th game, showing the Brewers with a 5.5 R (runs?) and the Rockies with 3.0, but the detailed box score isn't clear. The probable starting pitchers are listed as Priester and Feltner. The previous games listed show the Brewers won on April 9th and 8th, but the April 10th game's outcome isn't explicitly stated here.\n\nWait, search result [9] on thescore.com has a final score of Brewers 2 and Rockies 7. The detailed scoring shows Milwaukee scoring 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0 (total 2) and Colorado 1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,X (total 7). So the Rockies won 7-2 on April 10th. That would mean the market should resolve to Colorado Rockies (p1). But I need to confirm this with other sources.\n\nLooking at search result [10], the preview mentions the Brewers' record as 7-5 and the Rockies as 2-9 going into the April 10th game. The injury report is also listed. However, this is a preview, not the result.\n\nSearch result [3] from pickdawgz.com has a prediction for the April 10th game, but it's a prediction, not the actual result. Similarly, [2] and [8] are betting previews without post-game data.\n\nSearch result [14] from the-journal.com discusses the April 9th game where the Brewers won 17-2. The \"Up next\" section mentions Ryan Feltner pitching for Colorado on April 10th, but doesn't provide the result.\n\nThe key here is to find a source that explicitly states the outcome of the April 10th game. Search result [9] on thescore.com shows the final score as Brewers 2, Rockies 7. Additionally, the box score in [13] under \"PREVIOUS GAMES\" for MIL lists the April 10th game as a win, but the detailed box score in [9] indicates a Rockies victory. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, in [9], the final score is listed as MIL Brewers 7-5 and COL Rockies 2-9, but the inning-by-inning breakdown shows COL scoring 7 runs. This might be a formatting error. Alternatively, the detailed scoring in [9] shows COL scoring 7 runs (1 in the 1st, 1 in the 7th, 5 in the 8th), totaling 7, while MIL scores 2 (1 in the 4th, 1 in the 8th). Therefore, the Rockies won 7-2. \n\nSince the game was played on April 10th and the Rockies won, the market should resolve to p1 (Colorado Rockies). However, I need to ensure that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Milwaukee Brewers vs. Colorado Rockies, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 10 at 3:10PM ET:\nIf the Milwaukee Brewers win, the market will resolve to \"Milwaukee Brewers\".\nIf the Colorado Rockies win, the market will resolve to \"Colorado Rockies\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Colorado Rockies, p2 to Milwaukee Brewers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744321744 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 21:49:04 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

        "prompt": "You are a UMA optimistic oracle overseer AI, responsible for evaluating responses for UMA's optimistic oracle system.\n\nThe response you are evaluating came from the code_runner solver, attempt 3.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the response is sufficient to provide a definitive recommendation for the query. You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Milwaukee Brewers vs. Colorado Rockies, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 10 at 3:10PM ET:\nIf the Milwaukee Brewers win, the market will resolve to \"Milwaukee Brewers\".\nIf the Colorado Rockies win, the market will resolve to \"Colorado Rockies\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Colorado Rockies, p2 to Milwaukee Brewers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744321744 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 21:49:04 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Milwaukee Brewers vs. Colorado Rockies game on April 10, 2025, at 3:10 PM ET. The current date is April 10, 2025, 9:49 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has occurred and what the result was. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the Brewers winning 17-2 on April 9th, but that's the previous game. The query is about the game on April 10th. Wait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 10 at 3:10 PM ET. Let me check the search results again.\n\nSearch result [9] from thescore.com shows a game on April 10th where the Brewers won 2-1. Wait, no, looking closer, the final score in [9] is listed as Brewers 7-5 and Rockies 2-9, but the detailed scoring shows Milwaukee 2 and Colorado 7. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me cross-reference with other sources.\n\nSearch result [12] is a YouTube live stream titled \"LIVE Milwaukee Brewers VS Colorado Rockies - April 10th /MLB THE SHOW 25\", which might indicate the game was played. However, the description in [12] mentions a home run by Yelich, but without a clear final score. \n\nSearch result [11] from CBS Sports provides a preview of the April 10th game, mentioning that the Brewers are aiming for a series sweep. The article states that Quinn Priester is making his debut for Milwaukee, and Ryan Feltner is starting for Colorado. It also notes the Brewers' recent offensive performance. However, this is a preview, not a post-game report.\n\nSearch result [13] from Fox Sports includes a box score for the April 10th game, showing the Brewers with a 5.5 R (runs?) and the Rockies with 3.0, but the detailed box score isn't clear. The probable starting pitchers are listed as Priester and Feltner. The previous games listed show the Brewers won on April 9th and 8th, but the April 10th game's outcome isn't explicitly stated here.\n\nWait, search result [9] on thescore.com has a final score of Brewers 2 and Rockies 7. The detailed scoring shows Milwaukee scoring 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0 (total 2) and Colorado 1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,X (total 7). So the Rockies won 7-2 on April 10th. That would mean the market should resolve to Colorado Rockies (p1). But I need to confirm this with other sources.\n\nLooking at search result [10], the preview mentions the Brewers' record as 7-5 and the Rockies as 2-9 going into the April 10th game. The injury report is also listed. However, this is a preview, not the result.\n\nSearch result [3] from pickdawgz.com has a prediction for the April 10th game, but it's a prediction, not the actual result. Similarly, [2] and [8] are betting previews without post-game data.\n\nSearch result [14] from the-journal.com discusses the April 9th game where the Brewers won 17-2. The \"Up next\" section mentions Ryan Feltner pitching for Colorado on April 10th, but doesn't provide the result.\n\nThe key here is to find a source that explicitly states the outcome of the April 10th game. Search result [9] on thescore.com shows the final score as Brewers 2, Rockies 7. Additionally, the box score in [13] under \"PREVIOUS GAMES\" for MIL lists the April 10th game as a win, but the detailed box score in [9] indicates a Rockies victory. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, in [9], the final score is listed as MIL Brewers 7-5 and COL Rockies 2-9, but the inning-by-inning breakdown shows COL scoring 7 runs. This might be a formatting error. Alternatively, the detailed scoring in [9] shows COL scoring 7 runs (1 in the 1st, 1 in the 7th, 5 in the 8th), totaling 7, while MIL scores 2 (1 in the 4th, 1 in the 8th). Therefore, the Rockies won 7-2. \n\nSince the game was played on April 10th and the Rockies won, the market should resolve to p1 (Colorado Rockies). However, I need to ensure that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

That would mean the market should resolve to Colorado Rockies (p1). But I need to confirm this with other sources.\n\nLooking at search result [10], the preview mentions the Brewers' record as 7-5 and the Rockies as 2-9 going into the April 10th game. The injury report is also listed. However, this is a preview, not the result.\n\nSearch result [3] from pickdawgz.com has a prediction for the April 10th game, but it's a prediction, not the actual result. Similarly, [2] and [8] are betting previews without post-game data.\n\nSearch result [14] from the-journal.com discusses the April 9th game where the Brewers won 17-2. The \"Up next\" section mentions Ryan Feltner pitching for Colorado on April 10th, but doesn't provide the result.\n\nThe key here is to find a source that explicitly states the outcome of the April 10th game. Search result [9] on thescore.com shows the final score as Brewers 2, Rockies 7. Additionally, the box score in [13] under \"PREVIOUS GAMES\" for MIL lists the April 10th game as a win, but the detailed box score in [9] indicates a Rockies victory. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, in [9], the final score is listed as MIL Brewers 7-5 and COL Rockies 2-9, but the inning-by-inning breakdown shows COL scoring 7 runs. This might be a formatting error. Alternatively, the detailed scoring in [9] shows COL scoring 7 runs (1 in the 1st, 1 in the 7th, 5 in the 8th), totaling 7, while MIL scores 2 (1 in the 4th, 1 in the 8th). Therefore, the Rockies won 7-2. \n\nSince the game was played on April 10th and the Rockies won, the market should resolve to p1 (Colorado Rockies). However, I need to ensure that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to Colorado Rockies, p2 to Milwaukee Brewers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744321744 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 21:49:04 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Milwaukee Brewers vs. Colorado Rockies game on April 10, 2025, at 3:10 PM ET. The current date is April 10, 2025, 9:49 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has occurred and what the result was. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the Brewers winning 17-2 on April 9th, but that's the previous game. The query is about the game on April 10th. Wait, the user's query mentions the game scheduled for April 10 at 3:10 PM ET. Let me check the search results again.\n\nSearch result [9] from thescore.com shows a game on April 10th where the Brewers won 2-1. Wait, no, looking closer, the final score in [9] is listed as Brewers 7-5 and Rockies 2-9, but the detailed scoring shows Milwaukee 2 and Colorado 7. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me cross-reference with other sources.\n\nSearch result [12] is a YouTube live stream titled \"LIVE Milwaukee Brewers VS Colorado Rockies - April 10th /MLB THE SHOW 25\", which might indicate the game was played. However, the description in [12] mentions a home run by Yelich, but without a clear final score. \n\nSearch result [11] from CBS Sports provides a preview of the April 10th game, mentioning that the Brewers are aiming for a series sweep. The article states that Quinn Priester is making his debut for Milwaukee, and Ryan Feltner is starting for Colorado. It also notes the Brewers' recent offensive performance. However, this is a preview, not a post-game report.\n\nSearch result [13] from Fox Sports includes a box score for the April 10th game, showing the Brewers with a 5.5 R (runs?) and the Rockies with 3.0, but the detailed box score isn't clear. The probable starting pitchers are listed as Priester and Feltner. The previous games listed show the Brewers won on April 9th and 8th, but the April 10th game's outcome isn't explicitly stated here.\n\nWait, search result [9] on thescore.com has a final score of Brewers 2 and Rockies 7. The detailed scoring shows Milwaukee scoring 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0 (total 2) and Colorado 1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,X (total 7). So the Rockies won 7-2 on April 10th. That would mean the market should resolve to Colorado Rockies (p1). But I need to confirm this with other sources.\n\nLooking at search result [10], the preview mentions the Brewers' record as 7-5 and the Rockies as 2-9 going into the April 10th game. The injury report is also listed. However, this is a preview, not the result.\n\nSearch result [3] from pickdawgz.com has a prediction for the April 10th game, but it's a prediction, not the actual result. Similarly, [2] and [8] are betting previews without post-game data.\n\nSearch result [14] from the-journal.com discusses the April 9th game where the Brewers won 17-2. The \"Up next\" section mentions Ryan Feltner pitching for Colorado on April 10th, but doesn't provide the result.\n\nThe key here is to find a source that explicitly states the outcome of the April 10th game. Search result [9] on thescore.com shows the final score as Brewers 2, Rockies 7. Additionally, the box score in [13] under \"PREVIOUS GAMES\" for MIL lists the April 10th game as a win, but the detailed box score in [9] indicates a Rockies victory. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, in [9], the final score is listed as MIL Brewers 7-5 and COL Rockies 2-9, but the inning-by-inning breakdown shows COL scoring 7 runs. This might be a formatting error. Alternatively, the detailed scoring in [9] shows COL scoring 7 runs (1 in the 1st, 1 in the 7th, 5 in the 8th), totaling 7, while MIL scores 2 (1 in the 4th, 1 in the 8th). Therefore, the Rockies won 7-2. \n\nSince the game was played on April 10th and the Rockies won, the market should resolve to p1 (Colorado Rockies). However, I need to ensure that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Milwaukee Brewers, Price: 0.0225, ID: 110836313904664742464981492607448473122616430843875534626700770143225307265295, Winner: No\n- Token: Colorado Rockies, Price: 0.9775, ID: 28164154065840286713612326923974641010056974046529858219915855044478366989936, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Colorado Rockies outcome (0.978 = 97.8% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Additionally, the response does not align with the strong market sentiment, which heavily favors the Colorado Rockies, suggesting a possible error in the solver's analysis or an update in the game's outcome that was not captured.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744321744 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 21:49:04 UTC",
