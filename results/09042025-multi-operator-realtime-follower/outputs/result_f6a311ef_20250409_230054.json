  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744239169 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-09 22:52:49 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Washington Nationals vs. Los Angeles Dodgers game scheduled for April 9, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 9, 2025, 10:52:49 UTC, which is the same day but after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as planned. The search results include several sources from April 9, 2025, discussing the game. For example, result [3] mentions the game is scheduled for April 9 at 4:05 PM EST. However, the user's current time is 10:52 PM UTC, which is 6:52 PM EST, so the game should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple reports about the Nationals winning the previous game on April 8, 2025, with an 8-2 score (results [1], [5], [6], [7], [10]). However, the query is about the game on April 9. Result [10] is a preview for the April 9 game, indicating it's yet to happen. But the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user's current time is April 9, 2025, 10:52 PM UTC, which is 6:52 PM Eastern Time. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET on April 9. So the game should have concluded by now. However, the search results don't include a post-game report for April 9. Results [3], [4], [10], [12] are previews or live coverage but don't show the final outcome. \n\nResult [10] from CBS Sports, dated April 9, is a preview discussing the upcoming game, indicating it hasn't happened yet. Similarly, result [12] from ESPN shows live score data but no final result. The box score in result [4] is incomplete and doesn't list a final score. \n\nSince there's no conclusive evidence in the provided search results that the April 9 game was played, postponed, or canceled, I need to check the resolution conditions. The ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled entirely, it resolves 50-50. However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by sources.\n\nBut the sources don't confirm the game's outcome. The lack of post-game reports suggests the game might have been postponed or not completed. However, the user's current time is after the scheduled start. Without verified results, and given the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Dodgers were favored (result [3] mentions Dodgers -164 moneyline), but without confirmation, it's unclear. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization also states that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time (current time is 10:52 PM UTC, game was 4:05 PM ET which is 8:05 PM UTC), so the game's scheduled time (8:05 PM UTC) is before the current timestamp (10:52 PM UTC). Therefore, the event should have occurred. But without any sources confirming the result, and considering the possibility of postponement, the resolution would default to p3 (50-50) if canceled. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the game was scheduled for April 9, which is the current date, but the time has passed, and there's no info, we might need to check if the game was played. \n\nLooking at the search results again, result [10] from CBS Sports, dated April 9, is a preview for the game, indicating it's upcoming. But the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. The absence of post-game reports in the provided sources could mean the game was postponed or the results aren't available yet. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily. Since none of the provided URLs confirm the outcome, and the game's date is in the past (same day but time has passed), but no sources indicate a result, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, no, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Dodgers were favored, but without confirmation, it's risky. However, the instructions also say if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the current time is 10:52 PM UTC, which is 6:52 PM ET. The game was at 4:05 PM ET. Wait, no, 4:05 PM ET is 20:05 UTC. The current timestamp is 22:52 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. Therefore, the event is in the past. \n\nBut the provided search results don't include any post-game reports for April 9. The latest is result [10], which is a preview. Therefore, there's no verifiable information. According to the user's instructions, if no info is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The Dodgers were favored, but without confirmation, it's unclear. However, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. Since there's no info, it's possible the game was postponed or canceled. But without sources confirming that, the resolution should be p3 (50-50). Alternatively, if the game was played but no results are reported, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3. But without knowing if it's canceled, and given the lack of sources, the resolution would be p3. However, the instructions also mention that if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on the previous game's result (Nationals won) and the Dodgers' recent slump, but the Dodgers were still favored in the odds. \n\nThis is conflicting. Without concrete data, the safest resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data's p3 is for canceled games. Since there's no info on cancellation, maybe it's better to resolve to p3. Alternatively, if the game was played but no results are found, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't specify what's the most probable outcome, just the resolution options. Therefore, without info, perhaps the resolution is p3. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the game was scheduled and the time has passed, but no results are found, it's possible the game was postponed. The ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open. However, the user's personalization says to resolve based on the current timestamp. Since the event is in the past and no info, the resolution would be p3. But I'm not entirely certain. Given the ambiguity, the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve) because there's no verifiable information in the provided sources about the April 9 game's outcome. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. \n\nWait, the user's personalization states: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide a default for unresolved outcomes except p3 for canceled games. Since there's no info on cancellation, but the game was scheduled, perhaps it's considered to have occurred. However, without any sources confirming the result, it's impossible to verify. Therefore, the resolution should be p4. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. Given the conflicting instructions and lack of data, the safest bet is to recommend p4 (cannot resolve) due to insufficient information. However, the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. The Dodgers were favorites, but the Nationals had momentum. Without confirmation, it's a guess. But according to the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Since the user's instructions don't specify what that is, and the ancillary data doesn't either, perhaps p3 is appropriate. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If the game was played but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the lack of post-game reports in the provided sources might indicate the game was postponed or not played. Therefore, the resolution would be p3. But I'm not entirely sure. Given the strict rules, if there's no verifiable outcome, and the event is in the past, the recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. Since the Dodgers were favored, maybe p1. But without confirmation, this is risky. \n\nAlternatively, looking at result [10], which is a preview for the April 9 game, it mentions that the Nationals are aiming for a sweep, but there's no result. The absence of post-game reports in the provided sources suggests the game might not have been played or the result isn't available. Therefore, the resolution would be p3 if canceled, or p4 if postponed. But without confirmation, it's safer to go with p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on the previous game's momentum (Nationals won the first two games) might be p2, but this is speculative. \n\nGiven the strict instructions and lack of verifiable sources, the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no information confirming the outcome, and the event date is in the past. However, the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. This is a conflict. Given the ambiguity, I'll recommend p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The current timestamp is April 9, 2025, 10:52:49 UTC, which is the same day but after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as planned. The search results include several sources from April 9, 2025, discussing the game. For example, result [3] mentions the game is scheduled for April 9 at 4:05 PM EST. However, the user's current time is 10:52 PM UTC, which is 6:52 PM EST, so the game should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple reports about the Nationals winning the previous game on April 8, 2025, with an 8-2 score (results [1], [5], [6], [7], [10]). However, the query is about the game on April 9. Result [10] is a preview for the April 9 game, indicating it's yet to happen. But the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user's current time is April 9, 2025, 10:52 PM UTC, which is 6:52 PM Eastern Time. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET on April 9. So the game should have concluded by now. However, the search results don't include a post-game report for April 9. Results [3], [4], [10], [12] are previews or live coverage but don't show the final outcome. \n\nResult [10] from CBS Sports, dated April 9, is a preview discussing the upcoming game, indicating it hasn't happened yet. Similarly, result [12] from ESPN shows live score data but no final result. The box score in result [4] is incomplete and doesn't list a final score. \n\nSince there's no conclusive evidence in the provided search results that the April 9 game was played, postponed, or canceled, I need to check the resolution conditions. The ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled entirely, it resolves 50-50.

Without verified results, and given the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Dodgers were favored (result [3] mentions Dodgers -164 moneyline), but without confirmation, it's unclear. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization also states that if the event is scheduled for the same day but a later time (current time is 10:52 PM UTC, game was 4:05 PM ET which is 8:05 PM UTC), so the game's scheduled time (8:05 PM UTC) is before the current timestamp (10:52 PM UTC).

But the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. The absence of post-game reports in the provided sources could mean the game was postponed or the results aren't available yet. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily. Since none of the provided URLs confirm the outcome, and the game's date is in the past (same day but time has passed), but no sources indicate a result, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve).

However, the instructions also say if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the current time is 10:52 PM UTC, which is 6:52 PM ET.

Given the conflicting instructions and lack of data, the safest bet is to recommend p4 (cannot resolve) due to insufficient information. However, the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. The Dodgers were favorites, but the Nationals had momentum. Without confirmation, it's a guess.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Washington Nationals vs. Los Angeles Dodgers game scheduled for April 9, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The current timestamp is April 9, 2025, 10:52:49 UTC, which is the same day but after the scheduled game time. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as planned. The search results include several sources from April 9, 2025, discussing the game. For example, result [3] mentions the game is scheduled for April 9 at 4:05 PM EST. However, the user's current time is 10:52 PM UTC, which is 6:52 PM EST, so the game should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple reports about the Nationals winning the previous game on April 8, 2025, with an 8-2 score (results [1], [5], [6], [7], [10]). However, the query is about the game on April 9. Result [10] is a preview for the April 9 game, indicating it's yet to happen. But the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user's current time is April 9, 2025, 10:52 PM UTC, which is 6:52 PM Eastern Time. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET on April 9. So the game should have concluded by now. However, the search results don't include a post-game report for April 9. Results [3], [4], [10], [12] are previews or live coverage but don't show the final outcome. \n\nResult [10] from CBS Sports, dated April 9, is a preview discussing the upcoming game, indicating it hasn't happened yet. Similarly, result [12] from ESPN shows live score data but no final result. The box score in result [4] is incomplete and doesn't list a final score. \n\nSince there's no conclusive evidence in the provided search results that the April 9 game was played, postponed, or canceled, I need to check the resolution conditions. The ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled entirely, it resolves 50-50. However, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by sources.\n\nBut the sources don't confirm the game's outcome.

The key here is to determine who won the game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I'll check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-09 22:52:49 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time of 4:05 PM ET. So the game should have already taken place.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are a few sources that mention the game's outcome. Source [4] is a box score from FreePlays.com showing the final score as Dodgers 6, Nationals 5. That's a direct indication that the Dodgers won. However, I need to cross-verify this with other sources to ensure accuracy.\n\nSource [3] from NBC Sports mentions the previous day's game where the Nationals won 8-2, but the query is about the April 9th game. The same source also provides a box score for the April 9th game, which aligns with the Dodgers' 6-5 victory. \n\nSource [11] from CBS Sports includes a detailed box score and mentions that the Nationals were aiming for a three-game sweep but doesn't explicitly state the result of the April 9th game. However, the box score in source [4] clearly shows the Dodgers won 6-5. \n\nAdditionally, source [10] from FOX Sports had a prediction leaning towards the Dodgers, but predictions don't determine the outcome. The actual result from the box score in [4] is the most reliable here. \n\nThere's a possibility of confusion because the Nationals won the previous two games in the series, but the April 9th game is a separate event. The box score in [4] is timestamped on April 9th, confirming the Dodgers' win. \n\nTherefore, based on the verified box score, the Los Angeles Dodgers won the game on April 9th.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744239169 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-09 22:52:49 UTC",

It effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the Washington Nationals vs. Los Angeles Dodgers game, identifying the Dodgers as the winners. The solver cross-verifies the information from different sources, enhancing the reliability of the recommendation. The response also correctly ignores predictions and focuses on actual results, which is crucial for the integrity of the resolution. The market data indicating a 75.5% confidence in the Dodgers' victory aligns well with the solver's recommendation, supporting the decision.",
