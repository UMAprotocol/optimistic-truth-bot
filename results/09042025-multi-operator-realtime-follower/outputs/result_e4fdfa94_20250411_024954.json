  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game date (April 10) is in the past. That means I need to determine the actual outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources to consider. The first result [1] is a video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from NHL.com dated April 11, 2025. This suggests that Jackson Blake, a Hurricanes player, scored in the game. However, the video's description doesn't specify the final score.\n\nResult [4] from the Capitals' official site mentions their previous game against the Hurricanes on April 2, where the Capitals lost 5-1. But the relevant game here is on April 10. The same source [4] also states that the Caps' next game is on April 10 against the Hurricanes, but it doesn't provide the result.\n\nResult [5] gives the projected lineups for the April 10 game, but again, no score. Result [6] is a prediction article from April 10, which mentions the series is tied 1-1 this season but doesn't have the actual result.\n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows a box score for the game on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are listed, but the final score isn't immediately clear. However, looking at the team stats, the Capitals have 3.6 goals per game, and the Hurricanes have 3.2. But this doesn't confirm the outcome.\n\nResult [10] is a YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The transcript mentions a goal by Thompson and a final score of 1-0, but this seems to be a simulation or gameplay video, not the actual game. \n\nResult [12] from ESPN's preview page lists the teams' records but doesn't show the score. Result [13] from CapperTek mentions a simulated final score of Capitals 3 - Hurricanes 2, but this is a prediction, not the actual result.\n\nResult [15] from iHeartSportsDC has a computer prediction of Capitals 4 - Hurricanes 2, but again, this is a prediction, not the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [9] from ESPN provides a final score of Hurricanes 5-1 Capitals, but that's from April 2, 2025, not the April 10 game. Similarly, result [8] is a recap of the April 2 game where the Hurricanes won 5-1.\n\nLooking back, result [1] is a video from April 11, 2025, showing Jackson Blake scoring a goal against the Capitals. Since the game was on April 10, this video is likely from that game. If Blake scored, and the Hurricanes won, that would mean the market resolves to \"Hurricanes\" (p2). However, the video doesn't specify the final score. \n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows the game on April 10, but the detailed stats don't include the final score. The team stats show the Capitals with 49 wins and the Hurricanes with 46, but that's their season record, not the game result.\n\nResult [10]'s transcript mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's unclear if that's the actual game or a simulation. Since it's a gameplay video, it's not reliable for the real outcome.\n\nWithout a direct source stating the final score of the April 10 game, I need to infer based on available data. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Hurricanes winning. \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of the game's outcome. Some sources like [1] suggest a Hurricanes player scored, but without the final score, it's uncertain. Given the lack of explicit results, and following the instruction to default to p4 if no verifiable info exists, but the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe Capitals were leading the division, but the Hurricanes had a strong record. However, without concrete data, it's risky. But result [1] implies a Hurricanes goal, and if that's from the April 10 game, maybe they won. However, without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the video in result [1] is dated April 11, which is after the game. The video title says \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This indicates that in the game on April 10, Blake scored a goal. If the Hurricanes won, the market resolves to p2. But how do I know if they won?\n\nLooking at result [7], the Fox Sports page for the April 10 game lists the leading scorers but not the score. However, the Hurricanes' Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and the Capitals' Ovechkin has 42. The team stats show the Capitals with a higher goals per game, but that's season-long.\n\nResult [11] from Dimers.com predicts the Hurricanes have a 55% chance to win, but that's a prediction, not the result.\n\nSince there's no explicit final score in the search results, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data says p2 is Hurricanes. However, without confirmation, it's safer to default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market resolves to p2 if Hurricanes win. \n\nGiven the lack of clear data, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, and possibly a win, but uncertainty, I might have to recommend p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were strong. Without clear data, it's ambiguous. However, the video [1] existing suggests the Hurricanes scored, and if they won, p2. But without the final score, it's not certain. \n\nWait, result [10] is a YouTube video transcript that mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's a gameplay video, not real-life. So not reliable. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score, but the video [1] showing a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might have to go with p2 (Hurricanes). However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if there's no verifiable info, p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the ancillary data don't provide probabilities, just resolution options. \n\nGiven that, and the absence of explicit final score in the search results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, it's possible the Hurricanes won. However, without the final score, it's not confirmed. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were close. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't specify probabilities, so without clear info, the safe answer is p4. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Since the search results don't have the final score, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the game was on April 10, which is in the past, but no other sources confirm the outcome, I think the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of verifiable information. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the video [1] is part of the official NHL.com highlights, it's a reliable source. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won that game, then p2. But the video doesn't state the final score. However, in hockey, a single goal doesn't determine the game's outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, the safest recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Capitals were higher in the standings, maybe they were more likely to win, but the Hurricanes had beaten them before. \n\nThis is a tough call. Without clear data, but the video showing a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might lean towards p2. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the game was played and there's no report of the score, perhaps it's safer to go with p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the game was on April 10. The search results include a video from NHL.com dated April 11, which is the day after the game. The video's title indicates a Hurricanes player scored, which suggests they were part of the game. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. However, without the final score, it's still unclear. \n\nIn the absence of a clear final score in the search results, but considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given that the Capitals were leading the division, perhaps they were more likely to win. But the ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals and p2 as Hurricanes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed or canceled. But there's no mention of that in the search results. The user's instructions say if postponed, the market remains open; if canceled, resolve 50-50. But there's no info on cancellation. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable information about the game's outcome in the provided search results. The video shows a goal but not the final score, and other sources are predictions or about previous games. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the market cannot be resolved, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user's instructions say if postponed, the market remains open; if canceled, resolve 50-50. But there's no info on cancellation. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable information about the game's outcome in the provided search results. The video shows a goal but not the final score, and other sources are predictions or about previous games. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the market cannot be resolved, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game date (April 10) is in the past. That means I need to determine the actual outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources to consider. The first result [1] is a video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from NHL.com dated April 11, 2025. This suggests that Jackson Blake, a Hurricanes player, scored in the game. However, the video's description doesn't specify the final score.\n\nResult [4] from the Capitals' official site mentions their previous game against the Hurricanes on April 2, where the Capitals lost 5-1. But the relevant game here is on April 10. The same source [4] also states that the Caps' next game is on April 10 against the Hurricanes, but it doesn't provide the result.\n\nResult [5] gives the projected lineups for the April 10 game, but again, no score. Result [6] is a prediction article from April 10, which mentions the series is tied 1-1 this season but doesn't have the actual result.\n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows a box score for the game on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are listed, but the final score isn't immediately clear. However, looking at the team stats, the Capitals have 3.6 goals per game, and the Hurricanes have 3.2. But this doesn't confirm the outcome.\n\nResult [10] is a YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The transcript mentions a goal by Thompson and a final score of 1-0, but this seems to be a simulation or gameplay video, not the actual game. \n\nResult [12] from ESPN's preview page lists the teams' records but doesn't show the score. Result [13] from CapperTek mentions a simulated final score of Capitals 3 - Hurricanes 2, but this is a prediction, not the actual result.\n\nResult [15] from iHeartSportsDC has a computer prediction of Capitals 4 - Hurricanes 2, but again, this is a prediction, not the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [9] from ESPN provides a final score of Hurricanes 5-1 Capitals, but that's from April 2, 2025, not the April 10 game. Similarly, result [8] is a recap of the April 2 game where the Hurricanes won 5-1.\n\nLooking back, result [1] is a video from April 11, 2025, showing Jackson Blake scoring a goal against the Capitals. Since the game was on April 10, this video is likely from that game. If Blake scored, and the Hurricanes won, that would mean the market resolves to \"Hurricanes\" (p2). However, the video doesn't specify the final score. \n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows the game on April 10, but the detailed stats don't include the final score. The team stats show the Capitals with 49 wins and the Hurricanes with 46, but that's their season record, not the game result.\n\nResult [10]'s transcript mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's unclear if that's the actual game or a simulation. Since it's a gameplay video, it's not reliable for the real outcome.\n\nWithout a direct source stating the final score of the April 10 game, I need to infer based on available data. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Hurricanes winning. \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of the game's outcome. Some sources like [1] suggest a Hurricanes player scored, but without the final score, it's uncertain. Given the lack of explicit results, and following the instruction to default to p4 if no verifiable info exists, but the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe Capitals were leading the division, but the Hurricanes had a strong record. However, without concrete data, it's risky. But result [1] implies a Hurricanes goal, and if that's from the April 10 game, maybe they won. However, without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the video in result [1] is dated April 11, which is after the game. The video title says \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This indicates that in the game on April 10, Blake scored a goal. If the Hurricanes won, the market resolves to p2. But how do I know if they won?\n\nLooking at result [7], the Fox Sports page for the April 10 game lists the leading scorers but not the score. However, the Hurricanes' Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and the Capitals' Ovechkin has 42. The team stats show the Capitals with a higher goals per game, but that's season-long.\n\nResult [11] from Dimers.com predicts the Hurricanes have a 55% chance to win, but that's a prediction, not the result.\n\nSince there's no explicit final score in the search results, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data says p2 is Hurricanes. However, without confirmation, it's safer to default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market resolves to p2 if Hurricanes win. \n\nGiven the lack of clear data, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, and possibly a win, but uncertainty, I might have to recommend p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were strong. Without clear data, it's ambiguous. However, the video [1] existing suggests the Hurricanes scored, and if they won, p2. But without the final score, it's not certain. \n\nWait, result [10] is a YouTube video transcript that mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's a gameplay video, not real-life. So not reliable. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score, but the video [1] showing a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might have to go with p2 (Hurricanes). However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if there's no verifiable info, p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the ancillary data don't provide probabilities, just resolution options. \n\nGiven that, and the absence of explicit final score in the search results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, it's possible the Hurricanes won. However, without the final score, it's not confirmed. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were close. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't specify probabilities, so without clear info, the safe answer is p4. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Since the search results don't have the final score, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the game was on April 10, which is in the past, but no other sources confirm the outcome, I think the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of verifiable information. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the video [1] is part of the official NHL.com highlights, it's a reliable source. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won that game, then p2. But the video doesn't state the final score. However, in hockey, a single goal doesn't determine the game's outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, the safest recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Capitals were higher in the standings, maybe they were more likely to win, but the Hurricanes had beaten them before. \n\nThis is a tough call. Without clear data, but the video showing a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might lean towards p2. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the game was played and there's no report of the score, perhaps it's safer to go with p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the game was on April 10. The search results include a video from NHL.com dated April 11, which is the day after the game. The video's title indicates a Hurricanes player scored, which suggests they were part of the game. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. However, without the final score, it's still unclear. \n\nIn the absence of a clear final score in the search results, but considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given that the Capitals were leading the division, perhaps they were more likely to win. But the ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals and p2 as Hurricanes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed or canceled. But there's no mention of that in the search results. The user's instructions say if postponed, the market remains open; if canceled, resolve 50-50. But there's no info on cancellation. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable information about the game's outcome in the provided search results. The video shows a goal but not the final score, and other sources are predictions or about previous games. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the market cannot be resolved, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Capitals\" (p1) if they win, \"Hurricanes\" (p2) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if canceled. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from April 10, 2025. This suggests Blake scored, but it doesn't give the final score.\n2. **Source [2]**: A box score from Fox Sports. It lists the game as Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the final score isn't clear here. However, under \"TEAM STATS,\" Carolina is 46-26-4 and Washington is 49-19-9. The game's outcome isn't directly stated here.\n3. **Source [3]**: A detailed recap from April 2, 2025, where Carolina won 5-1. But this is a previous game, not the April 10 matchup.\n4. **Source [4]**: ESPN's game summary for April 2, 2025, again showing Carolina's 5-1 win. Not the relevant date.\n5. **Source [5]**: A prediction article from April 9, 2025, forecasting the April 10 game. It mentions the Capitals' recent record and predicts a 4-2 win. But this is a prediction, not the result.\n6. **Source [6]**: Another prediction from April 9, 2025, with similar info. Still a prediction.\n7. **Source [7]**: TheScore.com's event page for April 10, 2025. It shows the Capitals' record as 49-19-9 and the Hurricanes as 46-27-4. The \"Last 10\" games for the Capitals are 5-4-1, and they're on a L2 streak. The game's outcome isn't listed here.\n8. **Source [8]**: A YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The description includes a transcript mentioning a goal by Blake, but it's unclear if this is real gameplay or a simulation. The video might not reflect the actual game.\n9. **Source [9]**: Dimers' prediction model giving Carolina a 55% chance to win, but again, a prediction.\n10. **Source [10]**: TrustnBet's prediction suggesting a Hurricanes win. Still a prediction.\n11. **Source [11]**: ESPN Asheville's prediction of Capitals 4-2. Another prediction.\n12. **Source [12]**: NHL.com's preview for the April 10 game, mentioning the Caps' previous loss to the Islanders and Ovechkin's record-breaking goal. No result here.\n13. **Source [13]**: Fox Sports 960's prediction similar to others. Prediction, not result.\n14. **Source [14]**: ABC11's preview article, also without the game's outcome.\n\nNone of the sources explicitly state the result of the April 10 game. However, source [1] shows a goal by Jackson Blake (Hurricanes) from April 10, and source [8]'s transcript mentions a goal by Blake in a game that might be the actual one. But without a clear final score, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals win, p2 as Hurricanes. The predictions were mixed, some favoring Capitals, others Hurricanes. However, the absence of a clear result in the sources might lead to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Capitals, p2 for Hurricanes. If the game happened but no sources confirm the result, we might have to infer. However, the search results do include a video (source [1]) of a Hurricanes goal from April 10, which implies they played and scored. But without the final score, it's risky. However, considering the user's instruction to check alternative sources and the presence of the video, it's possible the Hurricanes won. But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was played and no sources report a cancellation, it's not canceled. But without a clear winner, the safe answer might still be p4. However, the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, so the game happened on April 10. The lack of reports might mean it's not updated yet. But some sources (like [1]) are dated April 11 and mention the game. The video in [1] is from NHL.com, a reliable source, showing a Hurricanes goal. If that's part of the game, and assuming the Hurricanes won, but without the final score, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, they want another approach. \n\nLooking again, source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score. The team stats show Capitals as 1st in Metropolitan with 49-19-9, Hurricanes 2nd with 46-27-4. The game's result isn't explicitly stated, but under \"TEAM LEADERS\" for Carolina, Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and for Washington, Ovechkin has 42. The box score might be a preview, not the result. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with records: Capitals 49-19-9, Hurricanes 46-27-4. Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This suggests the Capitals lost their last game, and Hurricanes are on a 3-loss streak. But this is before the April 10 game. \n\nSource [12] (NHL.com) mentions the Caps' game on April 10 as their penultimate home game, but no result. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and considering the user's instruction to avoid p4, perhaps the most probable outcome based on recent form (Capitals 5-4-1 last 10, Hurricanes 5-5-0) and home advantage, but predictions were mixed. However, the ancillary data requires actual outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data are if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50. Since the game was scheduled and there's no indication of cancellation, it was played. Therefore, the market should resolve based on the winner. Without explicit sources, but the video in [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and if that's the only info, maybe the Hurricanes won. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the game's result isn't in the sources yet because it's too recent (current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC, so the game ended around 2 AM UTC on April 11. The sources might not have updated yet. However, source [1] is from NHL.com dated April 11, showing a Hurricanes goal, which implies the game occurred. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports means it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were 1st in the division, had a better record, and home advantage. However, in their last meeting on April 2, Hurricanes won 5-1. Predictions were split. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the presence of a Hurricanes goal in the video, and considering the user's push to avoid p4, I might lean towards the Hurricanes winning, but this is speculative. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since no sources confirm the result, the recommendation should be p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data where p2 is Hurricanes win. If the game was played and no sources report the result, but the video shows a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the game was played and Hurricanes won. Alternatively, the video could be a highlight from a previous game. Wait, source [1] is dated April 11, 2025, and the video is titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This is from the official NHL site, so it's a valid source. The existence of this video confirms that the game took place on April 10, and the Hurricanes scored at least one goal. However, without the final score, we can't determine the winner. \n\nBut perhaps other sources have the score. Let me check again. Source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score but it's unclear if it's pre-game or post-game. The team stats show Capitals with 3.6 goals per game (1st) and Hurricanes 3.21 (9th). The \"Last 10\" for Capitals is 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This might be pre-game info. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with a \"Final\" score? The page shows \"CAR Hurricanes 46-27-4, 2nd Metropolitan\" and \"WSH Capitals 49-19-9, 1st Metropolitan.\" Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" is L1 for Capitals, L3 for Hurricanes. This seems to be pre-game data. \n\nSource [8] (YouTube) transcript mentions a goal by Blake, but it's a gameplay video, possibly a simulation, not the actual game. \n\nGiven that the only post-game source is [1], which confirms the game occurred and a Hurricanes goal, but no final score, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no info, I have to make a judgment. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes had beaten them recently. However, without the actual result, the correct resolution is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the lack of reports implies it's too recent. However, the current timestamp is April 11, 2:45 AM UTC, which is 10:45 PM ET on April 10. The game ended around 10 PM ET, so the reports might not be updated yet. But source [1] is from NHL.com and is dated April 11, so it's possible the result is there. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won, that would be p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the user's instructions to avoid p4 and the presence of the video showing a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the recommendation is p2. However, this is speculative. The accurate approach without explicit score is p4, but the user insists on trying again. \n\nAlternatively, check if any sources mention the game's outcome. Source [12] (NHL.com) from April 10 previews the game but doesn't have the result. Source [14] (ABC11) is a preview. \n\nGiven the constraints, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market should resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3 (50-50). However, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. Since the game was played (as per source [1]), p3 isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, despite the lack of explicit score, the presence of the video from NHL.com on April 11 suggests the game occurred, and the Hurricanes scored. If we assume they won, then p2. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the Capitals won, p1. Without clear data, but the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given the Capitals' better record and home advantage, maybe p1. However, the previous meeting was a Hurricanes win. \n\nThis is conflicting. The correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Given the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal and no Capitals goals mentioned, perhaps the Hurricanes won. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nIn conclusion, without verifiable final score, the recommendation remains p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the game was played (source [1]), but no score is available, the resolution should be p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. \n\nWait, source [2] has a box score. Let me recheck. The URL is for April 10, 2025, game. The page shows \"Scores\" but the actual score isn't listed. The team stats are pre-game. The \"TEAM STATS\" section shows Capitals with 3.6 goals per game, Hurricanes 3.21. This is likely a preview. \n\nTherefore, no sources provide the final score. The correct recommendation is p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. Maybe the answer is p2 based on the video showing a Hurricanes goal, assuming they won. But this is not certain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game is still ongoing, but the current timestamp is after the game. The game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC. The current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, so the game should have ended. \n\nGiven the lack of data, the only ethical answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on predictions. Source [9] (Dimers) gives Hurricanes 55% chance. Source [5] predicts Capitals 4-2. Source [11] also Capitals 4-2. But predictions are split. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome, not predictions. Therefore, without the actual result, p4 is correct. But the user insists on not p4. \n\nGiven the conflict, I'll have to go with p4 again, as per the guidelines, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market must resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3, but p3 is for canceled games. Since the game wasn't canceled, p4 is correct. \n\nFinal answer: p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Capitals\" (p1) if they win, \"Hurricanes\" (p2) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if canceled. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from April 10, 2025. This suggests Blake scored, but it doesn't give the final score.\n2. **Source [2]**: A box score from Fox Sports. It lists the game as Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the final score isn't clear here. However, under \"TEAM STATS,\" Carolina is 46-26-4 and Washington is 49-19-9. The game's outcome isn't directly stated here.\n3. **Source [3]**: A detailed recap from April 2, 2025, where Carolina won 5-1. But this is a previous game, not the April 10 matchup.\n4. **Source [4]**: ESPN's game summary for April 2, 2025, again showing Carolina's 5-1 win. Not the relevant date.\n5. **Source [5]**: A prediction article from April 9, 2025, forecasting the April 10 game. It mentions the Capitals' recent record and predicts a 4-2 win. But this is a prediction, not the result.\n6. **Source [6]**: Another prediction from April 9, 2025, with similar info. Still a prediction.\n7. **Source [7]**: TheScore.com's event page for April 10, 2025. It shows the Capitals' record as 49-19-9 and the Hurricanes as 46-27-4. The \"Last 10\" games for the Capitals are 5-4-1, and they're on a L2 streak. The game's outcome isn't listed here.\n8. **Source [8]**: A YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The description includes a transcript mentioning a goal by Blake, but it's unclear if this is real gameplay or a simulation. The video might not reflect the actual game.\n9. **Source [9]**: Dimers' prediction model giving Carolina a 55% chance to win, but again, a prediction.\n10. **Source [10]**: TrustnBet's prediction suggesting a Hurricanes win. Still a prediction.\n11. **Source [11]**: ESPN Asheville's prediction of Capitals 4-2. Another prediction.\n12. **Source [12]**: NHL.com's preview for the April 10 game, mentioning the Caps' previous loss to the Islanders and Ovechkin's record-breaking goal. No result here.\n13. **Source [13]**: Fox Sports 960's prediction similar to others. Prediction, not result.\n14. **Source [14]**: ABC11's preview article, also without the game's outcome.\n\nNone of the sources explicitly state the result of the April 10 game. However, source [1] shows a goal by Jackson Blake (Hurricanes) from April 10, and source [8]'s transcript mentions a goal by Blake in a game that might be the actual one. But without a clear final score, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals win, p2 as Hurricanes. The predictions were mixed, some favoring Capitals, others Hurricanes. However, the absence of a clear result in the sources might lead to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Capitals, p2 for Hurricanes. If the game happened but no sources confirm the result, we might have to infer. However, the search results do include a video (source [1]) of a Hurricanes goal from April 10, which implies they played and scored. But without the final score, it's risky. However, considering the user's instruction to check alternative sources and the presence of the video, it's possible the Hurricanes won. But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was played and no sources report a cancellation, it's not canceled. But without a clear winner, the safe answer might still be p4. However, the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, so the game happened on April 10. The lack of reports might mean it's not updated yet. But some sources (like [1]) are dated April 11 and mention the game. The video in [1] is from NHL.com, a reliable source, showing a Hurricanes goal. If that's part of the game, and assuming the Hurricanes won, but without the final score, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, they want another approach. \n\nLooking again, source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score. The team stats show Capitals as 1st in Metropolitan with 49-19-9, Hurricanes 2nd with 46-27-4. The game's result isn't explicitly stated, but under \"TEAM LEADERS\" for Carolina, Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and for Washington, Ovechkin has 42. The box score might be a preview, not the result. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with records: Capitals 49-19-9, Hurricanes 46-27-4. Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This suggests the Capitals lost their last game, and Hurricanes are on a 3-loss streak. But this is before the April 10 game. \n\nSource [12] (NHL.com) mentions the Caps' game on April 10 as their penultimate home game, but no result. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and considering the user's instruction to avoid p4, perhaps the most probable outcome based on recent form (Capitals 5-4-1 last 10, Hurricanes 5-5-0) and home advantage, but predictions were mixed. However, the ancillary data requires actual outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data are if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50. Since the game was scheduled and there's no indication of cancellation, it was played. Therefore, the market should resolve based on the winner. Without explicit sources, but the video in [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and if that's the only info, maybe the Hurricanes won. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the game's result isn't in the sources yet because it's too recent (current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC, so the game ended around 2 AM UTC on April 11. The sources might not have updated yet. However, source [1] is from NHL.com dated April 11, showing a Hurricanes goal, which implies the game occurred. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports means it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were 1st in the division, had a better record, and home advantage. However, in their last meeting on April 2, Hurricanes won 5-1. Predictions were split. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the presence of a Hurricanes goal in the video, and considering the user's push to avoid p4, I might lean towards the Hurricanes winning, but this is speculative. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since no sources confirm the result, the recommendation should be p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data where p2 is Hurricanes win. If the game was played and no sources report the result, but the video shows a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the game was played and Hurricanes won. Alternatively, the video could be a highlight from a previous game. Wait, source [1] is dated April 11, 2025, and the video is titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This is from the official NHL site, so it's a valid source. The existence of this video confirms that the game took place on April 10, and the Hurricanes scored at least one goal. However, without the final score, we can't determine the winner. \n\nBut perhaps other sources have the score. Let me check again. Source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score but it's unclear if it's pre-game or post-game. The team stats show Capitals with 3.6 goals per game (1st) and Hurricanes 3.21 (9th). The \"Last 10\" for Capitals is 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This might be pre-game info. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with a \"Final\" score? The page shows \"CAR Hurricanes 46-27-4, 2nd Metropolitan\" and \"WSH Capitals 49-19-9, 1st Metropolitan.\" Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Capitals\" (p1) if they win, \"Hurricanes\" (p2) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if canceled. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from April 10, 2025. This suggests Blake scored, but it doesn't give the final score.\n2. **Source [2]**: A box score from Fox Sports. It lists the game as Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the final score isn't clear here. However, under \"TEAM STATS,\" Carolina is 46-26-4 and Washington is 49-19-9. The game's outcome isn't directly stated here.\n3. **Source [3]**: A detailed recap from April 2, 2025, where Carolina won 5-1. But this is a previous game, not the April 10 matchup.\n4. **Source [4]**: ESPN's game summary for April 2, 2025, again showing Carolina's 5-1 win. Not the relevant date.\n5. **Source [5]**: A prediction article from April 9, 2025, forecasting the April 10 game. It mentions the Capitals' recent record and predicts a 4-2 win. But this is a prediction, not the result.\n6. **Source [6]**: Another prediction from April 9, 2025, with similar info. Still a prediction.\n7. **Source [7]**: TheScore.com's event page for April 10, 2025. It shows the Capitals' record as 49-19-9 and the Hurricanes as 46-27-4. The \"Last 10\" games for the Capitals are 5-4-1, and they're on a L2 streak. The game's outcome isn't listed here.\n8. **Source [8]**: A YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The description includes a transcript mentioning a goal by Blake, but it's unclear if this is real gameplay or a simulation. The video might not reflect the actual game.\n9. **Source [9]**: Dimers' prediction model giving Carolina a 55% chance to win, but again, a prediction.\n10. **Source [10]**: TrustnBet's prediction suggesting a Hurricanes win. Still a prediction.\n11. **Source [11]**: ESPN Asheville's prediction of Capitals 4-2. Another prediction.\n12. **Source [12]**: NHL.com's preview for the April 10 game, mentioning the Caps' previous loss to the Islanders and Ovechkin's record-breaking goal. No result here.\n13. **Source [13]**: Fox Sports 960's prediction similar to others. Prediction, not result.\n14. **Source [14]**: ABC11's preview article, also without the game's outcome.\n\nNone of the sources explicitly state the result of the April 10 game. However, source [1] shows a goal by Jackson Blake (Hurricanes) from April 10, and source [8]'s transcript mentions a goal by Blake in a game that might be the actual one. But without a clear final score, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals win, p2 as Hurricanes. The predictions were mixed, some favoring Capitals, others Hurricanes. However, the absence of a clear result in the sources might lead to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Capitals, p2 for Hurricanes. If the game happened but no sources confirm the result, we might have to infer. However, the search results do include a video (source [1]) of a Hurricanes goal from April 10, which implies they played and scored. But without the final score, it's risky. However, considering the user's instruction to check alternative sources and the presence of the video, it's possible the Hurricanes won. But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was played and no sources report a cancellation, it's not canceled. But without a clear winner, the safe answer might still be p4. However, the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, so the game happened on April 10. The lack of reports might mean it's not updated yet. But some sources (like [1]) are dated April 11 and mention the game. The video in [1] is from NHL.com, a reliable source, showing a Hurricanes goal. If that's part of the game, and assuming the Hurricanes won, but without the final score, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, they want another approach. \n\nLooking again, source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score. The team stats show Capitals as 1st in Metropolitan with 49-19-9, Hurricanes 2nd with 46-27-4. The game's result isn't explicitly stated, but under \"TEAM LEADERS\" for Carolina, Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and for Washington, Ovechkin has 42. The box score might be a preview, not the result. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with records: Capitals 49-19-9, Hurricanes 46-27-4. Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This suggests the Capitals lost their last game, and Hurricanes are on a 3-loss streak. But this is before the April 10 game. \n\nSource [12] (NHL.com) mentions the Caps' game on April 10 as their penultimate home game, but no result. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and considering the user's instruction to avoid p4, perhaps the most probable outcome based on recent form (Capitals 5-4-1 last 10, Hurricanes 5-5-0) and home advantage, but predictions were mixed. However, the ancillary data requires actual outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data are if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50. Since the game was scheduled and there's no indication of cancellation, it was played. Therefore, the market should resolve based on the winner. Without explicit sources, but the video in [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and if that's the only info, maybe the Hurricanes won. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the game's result isn't in the sources yet because it's too recent (current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC, so the game ended around 2 AM UTC on April 11. The sources might not have updated yet. However, source [1] is from NHL.com dated April 11, showing a Hurricanes goal, which implies the game occurred. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports means it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were 1st in the division, had a better record, and home advantage. However, in their last meeting on April 2, Hurricanes won 5-1. Predictions were split. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the presence of a Hurricanes goal in the video, and considering the user's push to avoid p4, I might lean towards the Hurricanes winning, but this is speculative. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since no sources confirm the result, the recommendation should be p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data where p2 is Hurricanes win. If the game was played and no sources report the result, but the video shows a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the game was played and Hurricanes won. Alternatively, the video could be a highlight from a previous game. Wait, source [1] is dated April 11, 2025, and the video is titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This is from the official NHL site, so it's a valid source. The existence of this video confirms that the game took place on April 10, and the Hurricanes scored at least one goal. However, without the final score, we can't determine the winner. \n\nBut perhaps other sources have the score. Let me check again. Source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score but it's unclear if it's pre-game or post-game. The team stats show Capitals with 3.6 goals per game (1st) and Hurricanes 3.21 (9th). The \"Last 10\" for Capitals is 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This might be pre-game info. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with a \"Final\" score? The page shows \"CAR Hurricanes 46-27-4, 2nd Metropolitan\" and \"WSH Capitals 49-19-9, 1st Metropolitan.\" Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" is L1 for Capitals, L3 for Hurricanes. This seems to be pre-game data. \n\nSource [8] (YouTube) transcript mentions a goal by Blake, but it's a gameplay video, possibly a simulation, not the actual game. \n\nGiven that the only post-game source is [1], which confirms the game occurred and a Hurricanes goal, but no final score, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no info, I have to make a judgment. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes had beaten them recently. However, without the actual result, the correct resolution is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the lack of reports implies it's too recent. However, the current timestamp is April 11, 2:45 AM UTC, which is 10:45 PM ET on April 10. The game ended around 10 PM ET, so the reports might not be updated yet. But source [1] is from NHL.com and is dated April 11, so it's possible the result is there. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won, that would be p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the user's instructions to avoid p4 and the presence of the video showing a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the recommendation is p2. However, this is speculative. The accurate approach without explicit score is p4, but the user insists on trying again. \n\nAlternatively, check if any sources mention the game's outcome. Source [12] (NHL.com) from April 10 previews the game but doesn't have the result. Source [14] (ABC11) is a preview. \n\nGiven the constraints, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market should resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3 (50-50). However, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. Since the game was played (as per source [1]), p3 isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, despite the lack of explicit score, the presence of the video from NHL.com on April 11 suggests the game occurred, and the Hurricanes scored. If we assume they won, then p2. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the Capitals won, p1. Without clear data, but the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given the Capitals' better record and home advantage, maybe p1. However, the previous meeting was a Hurricanes win. \n\nThis is conflicting. The correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Given the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal and no Capitals goals mentioned, perhaps the Hurricanes won. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nIn conclusion, without verifiable final score, the recommendation remains p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the game was played (source [1]), but no score is available, the resolution should be p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. \n\nWait, source [2] has a box score. Let me recheck. The URL is for April 10, 2025, game. The page shows \"Scores\" but the actual score isn't listed. The team stats are pre-game. The \"TEAM STATS\" section shows Capitals with 3.6 goals per game, Hurricanes 3.21. This is likely a preview. \n\nTherefore, no sources provide the final score. The correct recommendation is p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. Maybe the answer is p2 based on the video showing a Hurricanes goal, assuming they won. But this is not certain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game is still ongoing, but the current timestamp is after the game. The game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC. The current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, so the game should have ended. \n\nGiven the lack of data, the only ethical answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on predictions. Source [9] (Dimers) gives Hurricanes 55% chance. Source [5] predicts Capitals 4-2. Source [11] also Capitals 4-2. But predictions are split. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome, not predictions. Therefore, without the actual result, p4 is correct. But the user insists on not p4. \n\nGiven the conflict, I'll have to go with p4 again, as per the guidelines, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market must resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3, but p3 is for canceled games. Since the game wasn't canceled, p4 is correct. \n\nFinal answer: p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

For example, [3] and [6] discuss a game on April 2 where the Hurricanes won 5-1. But the April 10 game is covered in [9] and [1], with [9] providing the conclusive shootout result.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions emphasize using provided URLs and updates. Since [9] is a direct transcript of the April 10 game's shootout, it's the most reliable source here. The Capitals won in the shootout, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Capitals). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other sources like [7] (ESPN Asheville) had a prediction of Capitals 4-2, but that's a prediction, not the actual result. The actual result is in [9]. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM MULTIPLE_SOLVERS SOLVER:\nCOMBINED RESULTS FROM MULTIPLE SOLVERS\n\n===== SOLVER: PERPLEXITY =====\nRECOMMENDATION: p4\nMARKET ALIGNMENT: The recommendation does not align with market sentiment, which moderately favors the Capitals.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game date (April 10) is in the past. That means I need to determine the actual outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources to consider. The first result [1] is a video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from NHL.com dated April 11, 2025. This suggests that Jackson Blake, a Hurricanes player, scored in the game. However, the video's description doesn't specify the final score.\n\nResult [4] from the Capitals' official site mentions their previous game against the Hurricanes on April 2, where the Capitals lost 5-1. But the relevant game here is on April 10. The same source [4] also states that the Caps' next game is on April 10 against the Hurricanes, but it doesn't provide the result.\n\nResult [5] gives the projected lineups for the April 10 game, but again, no score. Result [6] is a prediction article from April 10, which mentions the series is tied 1-1 this season but doesn't have the actual result.\n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows a box score for the game on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are listed, but the final score isn't immediately clear. However, looking at the team stats, the Capitals have 3.6 goals per game, and the Hurricanes have 3.2. But this doesn't confirm the outcome.\n\nResult [10] is a YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The transcript mentions a goal by Thompson and a final score of 1-0, but this seems to be a simulation or gameplay video, not the actual game. \n\nResult [12] from ESPN's preview page lists the teams' records but doesn't show the score. Result [13] from CapperTek mentions a simulated final score of Capitals 3 - Hurricanes 2, but this is a prediction, not the actual result.\n\nResult [15] from iHeartSportsDC has a computer prediction of Capitals 4 - Hurricanes 2, but again, this is a prediction, not the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [9] from ESPN provides a final score of Hurricanes 5-1 Capitals, but that's from April 2, 2025, not the April 10 game. Similarly, result [8] is a recap of the April 2 game where the Hurricanes won 5-1.\n\nLooking back, result [1] is a video from April 11, 2025, showing Jackson Blake scoring a goal against the Capitals. Since the game was on April 10, this video is likely from that game. If Blake scored, and the Hurricanes won, that would mean the market resolves to \"Hurricanes\" (p2). However, the video doesn't specify the final score. \n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows the game on April 10, but the detailed stats don't include the final score. The team stats show the Capitals with 49 wins and the Hurricanes with 46, but that's their season record, not the game result.\n\nResult [10]'s transcript mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's unclear if that's the actual game or a simulation. Since it's a gameplay video, it's not reliable for the real outcome.\n\nWithout a direct source stating the final score of the April 10 game, I need to infer based on available data. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Hurricanes winning. \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of the game's outcome. Some sources like [1] suggest a Hurricanes player scored, but without the final score, it's uncertain. Given the lack of explicit results, and following the instruction to default to p4 if no verifiable info exists, but the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe Capitals were leading the division, but the Hurricanes had a strong record. However, without concrete data, it's risky. But result [1] implies a Hurricanes goal, and if that's from the April 10 game, maybe they won. However, without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the video in result [1] is dated April 11, which is after the game. The video title says \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This indicates that in the game on April 10, Blake scored a goal. If the Hurricanes won, the market resolves to p2. But how do I know if they won?\n\nLooking at result [7], the Fox Sports page for the April 10 game lists the leading scorers but not the score. However, the Hurricanes' Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and the Capitals' Ovechkin has 42. The team stats show the Capitals with a higher goals per game, but that's season-long.\n\nResult [11] from Dimers.com predicts the Hurricanes have a 55% chance to win, but that's a prediction, not the result.\n\nSince there's no explicit final score in the search results, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data says p2 is Hurricanes. However, without confirmation, it's safer to default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market resolves to p2 if Hurricanes win. \n\nGiven the lack of clear data, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, and possibly a win, but uncertainty, I might have to recommend p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were strong. Without clear data, it's ambiguous. However, the video [1] existing suggests the Hurricanes scored, and if they won, p2. But without the final score, it's not certain. \n\nWait, result [10] is a YouTube video transcript that mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's a gameplay video, not real-life. So not reliable. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score, but the video [1] showing a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might have to go with p2 (Hurricanes). However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if there's no verifiable info, p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the ancillary data don't provide probabilities, just resolution options. \n\nGiven that, and the absence of explicit final score in the search results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, it's possible the Hurricanes won. However, without the final score, it's not confirmed. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were close. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't specify probabilities, so without clear info, the safe answer is p4. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Since the search results don't have the final score, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the game was on April 10, which is in the past, but no other sources confirm the outcome, I think the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of verifiable information. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the video [1] is part of the official NHL.com highlights, it's a reliable source. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won that game, then p2. But the video doesn't state the final score. However, in hockey, a single goal doesn't determine the game's outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, the safest recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Capitals were higher in the standings, maybe they were more likely to win, but the Hurricanes had beaten them before. \n\nThis is a tough call. Without clear data, but the video showing a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might lean towards p2. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the game was played and there's no report of the score, perhaps it's safer to go with p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the game was on April 10. The search results include a video from NHL.com dated April 11, which is the day after the game. The video's title indicates a Hurricanes player scored, which suggests they were part of the game. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. However, without the final score, it's still unclear. \n\nIn the absence of a clear final score in the search results, but considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given that the Capitals were leading the division, perhaps they were more likely to win. But the ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals and p2 as Hurricanes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed or canceled. But there's no mention of that in the search results. The user's instructions say if postponed, the market remains open; if canceled, resolve 50-50. But there's no info on cancellation. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable information about the game's outcome in the provided search results. The video shows a goal but not the final score, and other sources are predictions or about previous games. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the market cannot be resolved, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\n========================================\n\n===== SOLVER: PERPLEXITY =====\nRECOMMENDATION: p4\nMARKET ALIGNMENT: The market moderately favors the Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence). This does not meet the threshold (>85% confidence) for a strong market sentiment that would require a contradiction to be a serious issue. Therefore, while the market leans towards the Capitals, it does not overwhelmingly contradict the solver's recommendation of p4.\n\nRESPONSE:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Capitals\" (p1) if they win, \"Hurricanes\" (p2) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if canceled. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from April 10, 2025. This suggests Blake scored, but it doesn't give the final score.\n2. **Source [2]**: A box score from Fox Sports. It lists the game as Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the final score isn't clear here. However, under \"TEAM STATS,\" Carolina is 46-26-4 and Washington is 49-19-9. The game's outcome isn't directly stated here.\n3. **Source [3]**: A detailed recap from April 2, 2025, where Carolina won 5-1. But this is a previous game, not the April 10 matchup.\n4. **Source [4]**: ESPN's game summary for April 2, 2025, again showing Carolina's 5-1 win. Not the relevant date.\n5. **Source [5]**: A prediction article from April 9, 2025, forecasting the April 10 game. It mentions the Capitals' recent record and predicts a 4-2 win. But this is a prediction, not the result.\n6. **Source [6]**: Another prediction from April 9, 2025, with similar info. Still a prediction.\n7. **Source [7]**: TheScore.com's event page for April 10, 2025. It shows the Capitals' record as 49-19-9 and the Hurricanes as 46-27-4. The \"Last 10\" games for the Capitals are 5-4-1, and they're on a L2 streak. The game's outcome isn't listed here.\n8. **Source [8]**: A YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The description includes a transcript mentioning a goal by Blake, but it's unclear if this is real gameplay or a simulation. The video might not reflect the actual game.\n9. **Source [9]**: Dimers' prediction model giving Carolina a 55% chance to win, but again, a prediction.\n10. **Source [10]**: TrustnBet's prediction suggesting a Hurricanes win. Still a prediction.\n11. **Source [11]**: ESPN Asheville's prediction of Capitals 4-2. Another prediction.\n12. **Source [12]**: NHL.com's preview for the April 10 game, mentioning the Caps' previous loss to the Islanders and Ovechkin's record-breaking goal. No result here.\n13. **Source [13]**: Fox Sports 960's prediction similar to others. Prediction, not result.\n14. **Source [14]**: ABC11's preview article, also without the game's outcome.\n\nNone of the sources explicitly state the result of the April 10 game. However, source [1] shows a goal by Jackson Blake (Hurricanes) from April 10, and source [8]'s transcript mentions a goal by Blake in a game that might be the actual one. But without a clear final score, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals win, p2 as Hurricanes. The predictions were mixed, some favoring Capitals, others Hurricanes. However, the absence of a clear result in the sources might lead to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Capitals, p2 for Hurricanes. If the game happened but no sources confirm the result, we might have to infer. However, the search results do include a video (source [1]) of a Hurricanes goal from April 10, which implies they played and scored. But without the final score, it's risky. However, considering the user's instruction to check alternative sources and the presence of the video, it's possible the Hurricanes won. But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was played and no sources report a cancellation, it's not canceled. But without a clear winner, the safe answer might still be p4. However, the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, so the game happened on April 10. The lack of reports might mean it's not updated yet. But some sources (like [1]) are dated April 11 and mention the game. The video in [1] is from NHL.com, a reliable source, showing a Hurricanes goal. If that's part of the game, and assuming the Hurricanes won, but without the final score, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, they want another approach. \n\nLooking again, source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score. The team stats show Capitals as 1st in Metropolitan with 49-19-9, Hurricanes 2nd with 46-27-4. The game's result isn't explicitly stated, but under \"TEAM LEADERS\" for Carolina, Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and for Washington, Ovechkin has 42. The box score might be a preview, not the result. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with records: Capitals 49-19-9, Hurricanes 46-27-4. Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This suggests the Capitals lost their last game, and Hurricanes are on a 3-loss streak. But this is before the April 10 game. \n\nSource [12] (NHL.com) mentions the Caps' game on April 10 as their penultimate home game, but no result. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and considering the user's instruction to avoid p4, perhaps the most probable outcome based on recent form (Capitals 5-4-1 last 10, Hurricanes 5-5-0) and home advantage, but predictions were mixed. However, the ancillary data requires actual outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data are if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50. Since the game was scheduled and there's no indication of cancellation, it was played. Therefore, the market should resolve based on the winner. Without explicit sources, but the video in [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and if that's the only info, maybe the Hurricanes won. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the game's result isn't in the sources yet because it's too recent (current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC, so the game ended around 2 AM UTC on April 11. The sources might not have updated yet. However, source [1] is from NHL.com dated April 11, showing a Hurricanes goal, which implies the game occurred. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports means it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were 1st in the division, had a better record, and home advantage. However, in their last meeting on April 2, Hurricanes won 5-1. Predictions were split. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the presence of a Hurricanes goal in the video, and considering the user's push to avoid p4, I might lean towards the Hurricanes winning, but this is speculative. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since no sources confirm the result, the recommendation should be p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data where p2 is Hurricanes win. If the game was played and no sources report the result, but the video shows a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the game was played and Hurricanes won. Alternatively, the video could be a highlight from a previous game. Wait, source [1] is dated April 11, 2025, and the video is titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This is from the official NHL site, so it's a valid source. The existence of this video confirms that the game took place on April 10, and the Hurricanes scored at least one goal. However, without the final score, we can't determine the winner. \n\nBut perhaps other sources have the score. Let me check again. Source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score but it's unclear if it's pre-game or post-game. The team stats show Capitals with 3.6 goals per game (1st) and Hurricanes 3.21 (9th). The \"Last 10\" for Capitals is 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This might be pre-game info. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with a \"Final\" score? The page shows \"CAR Hurricanes 46-27-4, 2nd Metropolitan\" and \"WSH Capitals 49-19-9, 1st Metropolitan.\" Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" is L1 for Capitals, L3 for Hurricanes. This seems to be pre-game data. \n\nSource [8] (YouTube) transcript mentions a goal by Blake, but it's a gameplay video, possibly a simulation, not the actual game. \n\nGiven that the only post-game source is [1], which confirms the game occurred and a Hurricanes goal, but no final score, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no info, I have to make a judgment. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes had beaten them recently. However, without the actual result, the correct resolution is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the lack of reports implies it's too recent. However, the current timestamp is April 11, 2:45 AM UTC, which is 10:45 PM ET on April 10. The game ended around 10 PM ET, so the reports might not be updated yet. But source [1] is from NHL.com and is dated April 11, so it's possible the result is there. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won, that would be p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the user's instructions to avoid p4 and the presence of the video showing a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the recommendation is p2. However, this is speculative. The accurate approach without explicit score is p4, but the user insists on trying again. \n\nAlternatively, check if any sources mention the game's outcome. Source [12] (NHL.com) from April 10 previews the game but doesn't have the result. Source [14] (ABC11) is a preview. \n\nGiven the constraints, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market should resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3 (50-50). However, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. Since the game was played (as per source [1]), p3 isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, despite the lack of explicit score, the presence of the video from NHL.com on April 11 suggests the game occurred, and the Hurricanes scored. If we assume they won, then p2. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the Capitals won, p1. Without clear data, but the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given the Capitals' better record and home advantage, maybe p1. However, the previous meeting was a Hurricanes win. \n\nThis is conflicting. The correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Given the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal and no Capitals goals mentioned, perhaps the Hurricanes won. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nIn conclusion, without verifiable final score, the recommendation remains p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the game was played (source [1]), but no score is available, the resolution should be p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. \n\nWait, source [2] has a box score. Let me recheck. The URL is for April 10, 2025, game. The page shows \"Scores\" but the actual score isn't listed. The team stats are pre-game. The \"TEAM STATS\" section shows Capitals with 3.6 goals per game, Hurricanes 3.21. This is likely a preview. \n\nTherefore, no sources provide the final score. The correct recommendation is p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. Maybe the answer is p2 based on the video showing a Hurricanes goal, assuming they won. But this is not certain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game is still ongoing, but the current timestamp is after the game. The game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC. The current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, so the game should have ended. \n\nGiven the lack of data, the only ethical answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on predictions. Source [9] (Dimers) gives Hurricanes 55% chance. Source [5] predicts Capitals 4-2. Source [11] also Capitals 4-2. But predictions are split. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome, not predictions. Therefore, without the actual result, p4 is correct. But the user insists on not p4. \n\nGiven the conflict, I'll have to go with p4 again, as per the guidelines, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market must resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3, but p3 is for canceled games. Since the game wasn't canceled, p4 is correct. \n\nFinal answer: p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\n========================================\n\n===== SOLVER: PERPLEXITY =====\nRECOMMENDATION: p1\nMARKET ALIGNMENT: The market moderately favors the Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence), which aligns with the solver's recommendation of p1. Although not above the 85% threshold for strong market sentiment, it supports the solver's conclusion.\n\nRESPONSE:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hurricanes win, it's p2; if the Capitals win, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already occurred. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game was scheduled for April 10, which is in the past. Now, I need to find out the result of that game from the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [9] is a YouTube video transcript of the shootout between the Hurricanes and Capitals on April 10. The transcript describes the shootout where the Capitals won. Specifically, it mentions that Charlie Lindgren made saves in the shootout, and the Caps won, clinching the top seed in the Eastern Conference. \n\nAdditionally, result [1] from leans.ai initially had the Capitals' record as 48-17-9, but in the detailed preview, it lists the Capitals' record as 49-19 and the Hurricanes as 46-27. However, the key info is in [9], which clearly states the outcome. The transcript details the shootout process, with the Capitals winning 4-3 in the shootout after a tied game. \n\nOther sources like [8] (ESPN game summary) and [3], [6], [11] refer to previous games between these teams, not the April 10 matchup. For example, [3] and [6] discuss a game on April 2 where the Hurricanes won 5-1. But the April 10 game is covered in [9] and [1], with [9] providing the conclusive shootout result.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions emphasize using provided URLs and updates. Since [9] is a direct transcript of the April 10 game's shootout, it's the most reliable source here. The Capitals won in the shootout, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Capitals). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other sources like [7] (ESPN Asheville) had a prediction of Capitals 4-2, but that's a prediction, not the actual result. The actual result is in [9]. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n========================================\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM MULTIPLE_SOLVERS SOLVER:\nCOMBINED RESULTS FROM MULTIPLE SOLVERS\n\n===== SOLVER: PERPLEXITY =====\nRECOMMENDATION: p4\nMARKET ALIGNMENT: The recommendation does not align with market sentiment, which moderately favors the Capitals.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game date (April 10) is in the past. That means I need to determine the actual outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources to consider. The first result [1] is a video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from NHL.com dated April 11, 2025. This suggests that Jackson Blake, a Hurricanes player, scored in the game. However, the video's description doesn't specify the final score.\n\nResult [4] from the Capitals' official site mentions their previous game against the Hurricanes on April 2, where the Capitals lost 5-1. But the relevant game here is on April 10. The same source [4] also states that the Caps' next game is on April 10 against the Hurricanes, but it doesn't provide the result.\n\nResult [5] gives the projected lineups for the April 10 game, but again, no score. Result [6] is a prediction article from April 10, which mentions the series is tied 1-1 this season but doesn't have the actual result.\n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows a box score for the game on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are listed, but the final score isn't immediately clear. However, looking at the team stats, the Capitals have 3.6 goals per game, and the Hurricanes have 3.2. But this doesn't confirm the outcome.\n\nResult [10] is a YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The transcript mentions a goal by Thompson and a final score of 1-0, but this seems to be a simulation or gameplay video, not the actual game. \n\nResult [12] from ESPN's preview page lists the teams' records but doesn't show the score. Result [13] from CapperTek mentions a simulated final score of Capitals 3 - Hurricanes 2, but this is a prediction, not the actual result.\n\nResult [15] from iHeartSportsDC has a computer prediction of Capitals 4 - Hurricanes 2, but again, this is a prediction, not the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [9] from ESPN provides a final score of Hurricanes 5-1 Capitals, but that's from April 2, 2025, not the April 10 game. Similarly, result [8] is a recap of the April 2 game where the Hurricanes won 5-1.\n\nLooking back, result [1] is a video from April 11, 2025, showing Jackson Blake scoring a goal against the Capitals. Since the game was on April 10, this video is likely from that game. If Blake scored, and the Hurricanes won, that would mean the market resolves to \"Hurricanes\" (p2). However, the video doesn't specify the final score. \n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows the game on April 10, but the detailed stats don't include the final score. The team stats show the Capitals with 49 wins and the Hurricanes with 46, but that's their season record, not the game result.\n\nResult [10]'s transcript mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's unclear if that's the actual game or a simulation. Since it's a gameplay video, it's not reliable for the real outcome.\n\nWithout a direct source stating the final score of the April 10 game, I need to infer based on available data. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Hurricanes winning. \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of the game's outcome. Some sources like [1] suggest a Hurricanes player scored, but without the final score, it's uncertain. Given the lack of explicit results, and following the instruction to default to p4 if no verifiable info exists, but the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe Capitals were leading the division, but the Hurricanes had a strong record. However, without concrete data, it's risky. But result [1] implies a Hurricanes goal, and if that's from the April 10 game, maybe they won. However, without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the video in result [1] is dated April 11, which is after the game. The video title says \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This indicates that in the game on April 10, Blake scored a goal. If the Hurricanes won, the market resolves to p2. But how do I know if they won?\n\nLooking at result [7], the Fox Sports page for the April 10 game lists the leading scorers but not the score. However, the Hurricanes' Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and the Capitals' Ovechkin has 42. The team stats show the Capitals with a higher goals per game, but that's season-long.\n\nResult [11] from Dimers.com predicts the Hurricanes have a 55% chance to win, but that's a prediction, not the result.\n\nSince there's no explicit final score in the search results, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data says p2 is Hurricanes. However, without confirmation, it's safer to default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market resolves to p2 if Hurricanes win. \n\nGiven the lack of clear data, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, and possibly a win, but uncertainty, I might have to recommend p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were strong. Without clear data, it's ambiguous. However, the video [1] existing suggests the Hurricanes scored, and if they won, p2. But without the final score, it's not certain. \n\nWait, result [10] is a YouTube video transcript that mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's a gameplay video, not real-life. So not reliable. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score, but the video [1] showing a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might have to go with p2 (Hurricanes). However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if there's no verifiable info, p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the ancillary data don't provide probabilities, just resolution options. \n\nGiven that, and the absence of explicit final score in the search results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, it's possible the Hurricanes won. However, without the final score, it's not confirmed. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were close. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't specify probabilities, so without clear info, the safe answer is p4. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Since the search results don't have the final score, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the game was on April 10, which is in the past, but no other sources confirm the outcome, I think the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of verifiable information. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the video [1] is part of the official NHL.com highlights, it's a reliable source. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won that game, then p2. But the video doesn't state the final score. However, in hockey, a single goal doesn't determine the game's outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, the safest recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Capitals were higher in the standings, maybe they were more likely to win, but the Hurricanes had beaten them before. \n\nThis is a tough call. Without clear data, but the video showing a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might lean towards p2. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the game was played and there's no report of the score, perhaps it's safer to go with p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the game was on April 10. The search results include a video from NHL.com dated April 11, which is the day after the game. The video's title indicates a Hurricanes player scored, which suggests they were part of the game. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. However, without the final score, it's still unclear. \n\nIn the absence of a clear final score in the search results, but considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given that the Capitals were leading the division, perhaps they were more likely to win. But the ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals and p2 as Hurricanes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed or canceled. But there's no mention of that in the search results. The user's instructions say if postponed, the market remains open; if canceled, resolve 50-50. But there's no info on cancellation. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable information about the game's outcome in the provided search results. The video shows a goal but not the final score, and other sources are predictions or about previous games. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the market cannot be resolved, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\n========================================\n\n===== SOLVER: PERPLEXITY =====\nRECOMMENDATION: p4\nMARKET ALIGNMENT: The market moderately favors the Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence). This does not meet the threshold (>85% confidence) for a strong market sentiment that would require a contradiction to be a serious issue. Therefore, while the market leans towards the Capitals, it does not overwhelmingly contradict the solver's recommendation of p4.\n\nRESPONSE:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Capitals\" (p1) if they win, \"Hurricanes\" (p2) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if canceled. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from April 10, 2025. This suggests Blake scored, but it doesn't give the final score.\n2. **Source [2]**: A box score from Fox Sports. It lists the game as Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the final score isn't clear here. However, under \"TEAM STATS,\" Carolina is 46-26-4 and Washington is 49-19-9. The game's outcome isn't directly stated here.\n3. **Source [3]**: A detailed recap from April 2, 2025, where Carolina won 5-1. But this is a previous game, not the April 10 matchup.\n4. **Source [4]**: ESPN's game summary for April 2, 2025, again showing Carolina's 5-1 win. Not the relevant date.\n5. **Source [5]**: A prediction article from April 9, 2025, forecasting the April 10 game. It mentions the Capitals' recent record and predicts a 4-2 win. But this is a prediction, not the result.\n6. **Source [6]**: Another prediction from April 9, 2025, with similar info. Still a prediction.\n7. **Source [7]**: TheScore.com's event page for April 10, 2025. It shows the Capitals' record as 49-19-9 and the Hurricanes as 46-27-4. The \"Last 10\" games for the Capitals are 5-4-1, and they're on a L2 streak. The game's outcome isn't listed here.\n8. **Source [8]**: A YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The description includes a transcript mentioning a goal by Blake, but it's unclear if this is real gameplay or a simulation. The video might not reflect the actual game.\n9. **Source [9]**: Dimers' prediction model giving Carolina a 55% chance to win, but again, a prediction.\n10. **Source [10]**: TrustnBet's prediction suggesting a Hurricanes win. Still a prediction.\n11. **Source [11]**: ESPN Asheville's prediction of Capitals 4-2. Another prediction.\n12. **Source [12]**: NHL.com's preview for the April 10 game, mentioning the Caps' previous loss to the Islanders and Ovechkin's record-breaking goal. No result here.\n13. **Source [13]**: Fox Sports 960's prediction similar to others. Prediction, not result.\n14. **Source [14]**: ABC11's preview article, also without the game's outcome.\n\nNone of the sources explicitly state the result of the April 10 game. However, source [1] shows a goal by Jackson Blake (Hurricanes) from April 10, and source [8]'s transcript mentions a goal by Blake in a game that might be the actual one. But without a clear final score, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals win, p2 as Hurricanes. The predictions were mixed, some favoring Capitals, others Hurricanes. However, the absence of a clear result in the sources might lead to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Capitals, p2 for Hurricanes. If the game happened but no sources confirm the result, we might have to infer. However, the search results do include a video (source [1]) of a Hurricanes goal from April 10, which implies they played and scored. But without the final score, it's risky. However, considering the user's instruction to check alternative sources and the presence of the video, it's possible the Hurricanes won. But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was played and no sources report a cancellation, it's not canceled. But without a clear winner, the safe answer might still be p4. However, the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, so the game happened on April 10. The lack of reports might mean it's not updated yet. But some sources (like [1]) are dated April 11 and mention the game. The video in [1] is from NHL.com, a reliable source, showing a Hurricanes goal. If that's part of the game, and assuming the Hurricanes won, but without the final score, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, they want another approach. \n\nLooking again, source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score. The team stats show Capitals as 1st in Metropolitan with 49-19-9, Hurricanes 2nd with 46-27-4. The game's result isn't explicitly stated, but under \"TEAM LEADERS\" for Carolina, Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and for Washington, Ovechkin has 42. The box score might be a preview, not the result. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with records: Capitals 49-19-9, Hurricanes 46-27-4. Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This suggests the Capitals lost their last game, and Hurricanes are on a 3-loss streak. But this is before the April 10 game. \n\nSource [12] (NHL.com) mentions the Caps' game on April 10 as their penultimate home game, but no result. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and considering the user's instruction to avoid p4, perhaps the most probable outcome based on recent form (Capitals 5-4-1 last 10, Hurricanes 5-5-0) and home advantage, but predictions were mixed. However, the ancillary data requires actual outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data are if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50. Since the game was scheduled and there's no indication of cancellation, it was played. Therefore, the market should resolve based on the winner. Without explicit sources, but the video in [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and if that's the only info, maybe the Hurricanes won. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the game's result isn't in the sources yet because it's too recent (current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC, so the game ended around 2 AM UTC on April 11. The sources might not have updated yet. However, source [1] is from NHL.com dated April 11, showing a Hurricanes goal, which implies the game occurred. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports means it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were 1st in the division, had a better record, and home advantage. However, in their last meeting on April 2, Hurricanes won 5-1. Predictions were split. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the presence of a Hurricanes goal in the video, and considering the user's push to avoid p4, I might lean towards the Hurricanes winning, but this is speculative. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since no sources confirm the result, the recommendation should be p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data where p2 is Hurricanes win. If the game was played and no sources report the result, but the video shows a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the game was played and Hurricanes won. Alternatively, the video could be a highlight from a previous game. Wait, source [1] is dated April 11, 2025, and the video is titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This is from the official NHL site, so it's a valid source. The existence of this video confirms that the game took place on April 10, and the Hurricanes scored at least one goal. However, without the final score, we can't determine the winner. \n\nBut perhaps other sources have the score. Let me check again. Source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score but it's unclear if it's pre-game or post-game. The team stats show Capitals with 3.6 goals per game (1st) and Hurricanes 3.21 (9th). The \"Last 10\" for Capitals is 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This might be pre-game info. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with a \"Final\" score? The page shows \"CAR Hurricanes 46-27-4, 2nd Metropolitan\" and \"WSH Capitals 49-19-9, 1st Metropolitan.\" Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" is L1 for Capitals, L3 for Hurricanes. This seems to be pre-game data. \n\nSource [8] (YouTube) transcript mentions a goal by Blake, but it's a gameplay video, possibly a simulation, not the actual game. \n\nGiven that the only post-game source is [1], which confirms the game occurred and a Hurricanes goal, but no final score, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no info, I have to make a judgment. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes had beaten them recently. However, without the actual result, the correct resolution is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the lack of reports implies it's too recent. However, the current timestamp is April 11, 2:45 AM UTC, which is 10:45 PM ET on April 10. The game ended around 10 PM ET, so the reports might not be updated yet. But source [1] is from NHL.com and is dated April 11, so it's possible the result is there. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won, that would be p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the user's instructions to avoid p4 and the presence of the video showing a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the recommendation is p2. However, this is speculative. The accurate approach without explicit score is p4, but the user insists on trying again. \n\nAlternatively, check if any sources mention the game's outcome. Source [12] (NHL.com) from April 10 previews the game but doesn't have the result. Source [14] (ABC11) is a preview. \n\nGiven the constraints, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market should resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3 (50-50). However, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. Since the game was played (as per source [1]), p3 isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, despite the lack of explicit score, the presence of the video from NHL.com on April 11 suggests the game occurred, and the Hurricanes scored. If we assume they won, then p2. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the Capitals won, p1. Without clear data, but the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given the Capitals' better record and home advantage, maybe p1. However, the previous meeting was a Hurricanes win. \n\nThis is conflicting. The correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Given the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal and no Capitals goals mentioned, perhaps the Hurricanes won. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nIn conclusion, without verifiable final score, the recommendation remains p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the game was played (source [1]), but no score is available, the resolution should be p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. \n\nWait, source [2] has a box score. Let me recheck. The URL is for April 10, 2025, game. The page shows \"Scores\" but the actual score isn't listed. The team stats are pre-game. The \"TEAM STATS\" section shows Capitals with 3.6 goals per game, Hurricanes 3.21. This is likely a preview. \n\nTherefore, no sources provide the final score. The correct recommendation is p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. Maybe the answer is p2 based on the video showing a Hurricanes goal, assuming they won. But this is not certain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game is still ongoing, but the current timestamp is after the game. The game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC. The current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, so the game should have ended. \n\nGiven the lack of data, the only ethical answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on predictions. Source [9] (Dimers) gives Hurricanes 55% chance. Source [5] predicts Capitals 4-2. Source [11] also Capitals 4-2. But predictions are split. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome, not predictions. Therefore, without the actual result, p4 is correct. But the user insists on not p4. \n\nGiven the conflict, I'll have to go with p4 again, as per the guidelines, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market must resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3, but p3 is for canceled games. Since the game wasn't canceled, p4 is correct. \n\nFinal answer: p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\n========================================\n\n===== SOLVER: PERPLEXITY =====\nRECOMMENDATION: p1\nMARKET ALIGNMENT: The market moderately favors the Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence), which aligns with the solver's recommendation of p1. Although not above the 85% threshold for strong market sentiment, it supports the solver's conclusion.\n\nRESPONSE:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hurricanes win, it's p2; if the Capitals win, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already occurred. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game was scheduled for April 10, which is in the past. Now, I need to find out the result of that game from the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [9] is a YouTube video transcript of the shootout between the Hurricanes and Capitals on April 10. The transcript describes the shootout where the Capitals won. Specifically, it mentions that Charlie Lindgren made saves in the shootout, and the Caps won, clinching the top seed in the Eastern Conference. \n\nAdditionally, result [1] from leans.ai initially had the Capitals' record as 48-17-9, but in the detailed preview, it lists the Capitals' record as 49-19 and the Hurricanes as 46-27. However, the key info is in [9], which clearly states the outcome. The transcript details the shootout process, with the Capitals winning 4-3 in the shootout after a tied game. \n\nOther sources like [8] (ESPN game summary) and [3], [6], [11] refer to previous games between these teams, not the April 10 matchup. For example, [3] and [6] discuss a game on April 2 where the Hurricanes won 5-1. But the April 10 game is covered in [9] and [1], with [9] providing the conclusive shootout result.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions emphasize using provided URLs and updates. Since [9] is a direct transcript of the April 10 game's shootout, it's the most reliable source here. The Capitals won in the shootout, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Capitals). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other sources like [7] (ESPN Asheville) had a prediction of Capitals 4-2, but that's a prediction, not the actual result. The actual result is in [9]. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n========================================\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game date (April 10) is in the past. That means I need to determine the actual outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources to consider. The first result [1] is a video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from NHL.com dated April 11, 2025. This suggests that Jackson Blake, a Hurricanes player, scored in the game. However, the video's description doesn't specify the final score.\n\nResult [4] from the Capitals' official site mentions their previous game against the Hurricanes on April 2, where the Capitals lost 5-1. But the relevant game here is on April 10. The same source [4] also states that the Caps' next game is on April 10 against the Hurricanes, but it doesn't provide the result.\n\nResult [5] gives the projected lineups for the April 10 game, but again, no score. Result [6] is a prediction article from April 10, which mentions the series is tied 1-1 this season but doesn't have the actual result.\n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows a box score for the game on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are listed, but the final score isn't immediately clear. However, looking at the team stats, the Capitals have 3.6 goals per game, and the Hurricanes have 3.2. But this doesn't confirm the outcome.\n\nResult [10] is a YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The transcript mentions a goal by Thompson and a final score of 1-0, but this seems to be a simulation or gameplay video, not the actual game. \n\nResult [12] from ESPN's preview page lists the teams' records but doesn't show the score. Result [13] from CapperTek mentions a simulated final score of Capitals 3 - Hurricanes 2, but this is a prediction, not the actual result.\n\nResult [15] from iHeartSportsDC has a computer prediction of Capitals 4 - Hurricanes 2, but again, this is a prediction, not the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [9] from ESPN provides a final score of Hurricanes 5-1 Capitals, but that's from April 2, 2025, not the April 10 game. Similarly, result [8] is a recap of the April 2 game where the Hurricanes won 5-1.\n\nLooking back, result [1] is a video from April 11, 2025, showing Jackson Blake scoring a goal against the Capitals. Since the game was on April 10, this video is likely from that game. If Blake scored, and the Hurricanes won, that would mean the market resolves to \"Hurricanes\" (p2). However, the video doesn't specify the final score. \n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows the game on April 10, but the detailed stats don't include the final score. The team stats show the Capitals with 49 wins and the Hurricanes with 46, but that's their season record, not the game result.\n\nResult [10]'s transcript mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's unclear if that's the actual game or a simulation. Since it's a gameplay video, it's not reliable for the real outcome.\n\nWithout a direct source stating the final score of the April 10 game, I need to infer based on available data. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Hurricanes winning. \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of the game's outcome. Some sources like [1] suggest a Hurricanes player scored, but without the final score, it's uncertain. Given the lack of explicit results, and following the instruction to default to p4 if no verifiable info exists, but the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe Capitals were leading the division, but the Hurricanes had a strong record. However, without concrete data, it's risky. But result [1] implies a Hurricanes goal, and if that's from the April 10 game, maybe they won. However, without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the video in result [1] is dated April 11, which is after the game. The video title says \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This indicates that in the game on April 10, Blake scored a goal. If the Hurricanes won, the market resolves to p2. But how do I know if they won?\n\nLooking at result [7], the Fox Sports page for the April 10 game lists the leading scorers but not the score. However, the Hurricanes' Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and the Capitals' Ovechkin has 42. The team stats show the Capitals with a higher goals per game, but that's season-long.\n\nResult [11] from Dimers.com predicts the Hurricanes have a 55% chance to win, but that's a prediction, not the result.\n\nSince there's no explicit final score in the search results, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data says p2 is Hurricanes. However, without confirmation, it's safer to default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market resolves to p2 if Hurricanes win. \n\nGiven the lack of clear data, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, and possibly a win, but uncertainty, I might have to recommend p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were strong. Without clear data, it's ambiguous. However, the video [1] existing suggests the Hurricanes scored, and if they won, p2. But without the final score, it's not certain. \n\nWait, result [10] is a YouTube video transcript that mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's a gameplay video, not real-life. So not reliable. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score, but the video [1] showing a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might have to go with p2 (Hurricanes). However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if there's no verifiable info, p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the ancillary data don't provide probabilities, just resolution options. \n\nGiven that, and the absence of explicit final score in the search results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, it's possible the Hurricanes won. However, without the final score, it's not confirmed. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were close. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't specify probabilities, so without clear info, the safe answer is p4. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Since the search results don't have the final score, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the game was on April 10, which is in the past, but no other sources confirm the outcome, I think the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of verifiable information. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the video [1] is part of the official NHL.com highlights, it's a reliable source. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won that game, then p2. But the video doesn't state the final score. However, in hockey, a single goal doesn't determine the game's outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, the safest recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Capitals were higher in the standings, maybe they were more likely to win, but the Hurricanes had beaten them before. \n\nThis is a tough call. Without clear data, but the video showing a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might lean towards p2. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the game was played and there's no report of the score, perhaps it's safer to go with p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the game was on April 10. The search results include a video from NHL.com dated April 11, which is the day after the game. The video's title indicates a Hurricanes player scored, which suggests they were part of the game. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. However, without the final score, it's still unclear. \n\nIn the absence of a clear final score in the search results, but considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given that the Capitals were leading the division, perhaps they were more likely to win. But the ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals and p2 as Hurricanes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed or canceled. But there's no mention of that in the search results. The user's instructions say if postponed, the market remains open; if canceled, resolve 50-50. But there's no info on cancellation. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable information about the game's outcome in the provided search results. The video shows a goal but not the final score, and other sources are predictions or about previous games. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the market cannot be resolved, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Capitals\" (p1) if they win, \"Hurricanes\" (p2) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if canceled. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from April 10, 2025. This suggests Blake scored, but it doesn't give the final score.\n2. **Source [2]**: A box score from Fox Sports. It lists the game as Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the final score isn't clear here. However, under \"TEAM STATS,\" Carolina is 46-26-4 and Washington is 49-19-9. The game's outcome isn't directly stated here.\n3. **Source [3]**: A detailed recap from April 2, 2025, where Carolina won 5-1. But this is a previous game, not the April 10 matchup.\n4. **Source [4]**: ESPN's game summary for April 2, 2025, again showing Carolina's 5-1 win. Not the relevant date.\n5. **Source [5]**: A prediction article from April 9, 2025, forecasting the April 10 game. It mentions the Capitals' recent record and predicts a 4-2 win. But this is a prediction, not the result.\n6. **Source [6]**: Another prediction from April 9, 2025, with similar info. Still a prediction.\n7. **Source [7]**: TheScore.com's event page for April 10, 2025. It shows the Capitals' record as 49-19-9 and the Hurricanes as 46-27-4. The \"Last 10\" games for the Capitals are 5-4-1, and they're on a L2 streak. The game's outcome isn't listed here.\n8. **Source [8]**: A YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The description includes a transcript mentioning a goal by Blake, but it's unclear if this is real gameplay or a simulation. The video might not reflect the actual game.\n9. **Source [9]**: Dimers' prediction model giving Carolina a 55% chance to win, but again, a prediction.\n10. **Source [10]**: TrustnBet's prediction suggesting a Hurricanes win. Still a prediction.\n11. **Source [11]**: ESPN Asheville's prediction of Capitals 4-2. Another prediction.\n12. **Source [12]**: NHL.com's preview for the April 10 game, mentioning the Caps' previous loss to the Islanders and Ovechkin's record-breaking goal. No result here.\n13. **Source [13]**: Fox Sports 960's prediction similar to others. Prediction, not result.\n14. **Source [14]**: ABC11's preview article, also without the game's outcome.\n\nNone of the sources explicitly state the result of the April 10 game. However, source [1] shows a goal by Jackson Blake (Hurricanes) from April 10, and source [8]'s transcript mentions a goal by Blake in a game that might be the actual one. But without a clear final score, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals win, p2 as Hurricanes. The predictions were mixed, some favoring Capitals, others Hurricanes. However, the absence of a clear result in the sources might lead to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Capitals, p2 for Hurricanes. If the game happened but no sources confirm the result, we might have to infer. However, the search results do include a video (source [1]) of a Hurricanes goal from April 10, which implies they played and scored. But without the final score, it's risky. However, considering the user's instruction to check alternative sources and the presence of the video, it's possible the Hurricanes won. But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was played and no sources report a cancellation, it's not canceled. But without a clear winner, the safe answer might still be p4. However, the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, so the game happened on April 10. The lack of reports might mean it's not updated yet. But some sources (like [1]) are dated April 11 and mention the game. The video in [1] is from NHL.com, a reliable source, showing a Hurricanes goal. If that's part of the game, and assuming the Hurricanes won, but without the final score, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, they want another approach. \n\nLooking again, source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score. The team stats show Capitals as 1st in Metropolitan with 49-19-9, Hurricanes 2nd with 46-27-4. The game's result isn't explicitly stated, but under \"TEAM LEADERS\" for Carolina, Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and for Washington, Ovechkin has 42. The box score might be a preview, not the result. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with records: Capitals 49-19-9, Hurricanes 46-27-4. Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This suggests the Capitals lost their last game, and Hurricanes are on a 3-loss streak. But this is before the April 10 game. \n\nSource [12] (NHL.com) mentions the Caps' game on April 10 as their penultimate home game, but no result. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and considering the user's instruction to avoid p4, perhaps the most probable outcome based on recent form (Capitals 5-4-1 last 10, Hurricanes 5-5-0) and home advantage, but predictions were mixed. However, the ancillary data requires actual outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data are if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50. Since the game was scheduled and there's no indication of cancellation, it was played. Therefore, the market should resolve based on the winner. Without explicit sources, but the video in [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and if that's the only info, maybe the Hurricanes won. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the game's result isn't in the sources yet because it's too recent (current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC, so the game ended around 2 AM UTC on April 11. The sources might not have updated yet. However, source [1] is from NHL.com dated April 11, showing a Hurricanes goal, which implies the game occurred. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports means it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were 1st in the division, had a better record, and home advantage. However, in their last meeting on April 2, Hurricanes won 5-1. Predictions were split. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the presence of a Hurricanes goal in the video, and considering the user's push to avoid p4, I might lean towards the Hurricanes winning, but this is speculative. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since no sources confirm the result, the recommendation should be p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data where p2 is Hurricanes win. If the game was played and no sources report the result, but the video shows a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the game was played and Hurricanes won. Alternatively, the video could be a highlight from a previous game. Wait, source [1] is dated April 11, 2025, and the video is titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This is from the official NHL site, so it's a valid source. The existence of this video confirms that the game took place on April 10, and the Hurricanes scored at least one goal. However, without the final score, we can't determine the winner. \n\nBut perhaps other sources have the score. Let me check again. Source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score but it's unclear if it's pre-game or post-game. The team stats show Capitals with 3.6 goals per game (1st) and Hurricanes 3.21 (9th). The \"Last 10\" for Capitals is 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This might be pre-game info. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with a \"Final\" score? The page shows \"CAR Hurricanes 46-27-4, 2nd Metropolitan\" and \"WSH Capitals 49-19-9, 1st Metropolitan.\" Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" is L1 for Capitals, L3 for Hurricanes. This seems to be pre-game data. \n\nSource [8] (YouTube) transcript mentions a goal by Blake, but it's a gameplay video, possibly a simulation, not the actual game. \n\nGiven that the only post-game source is [1], which confirms the game occurred and a Hurricanes goal, but no final score, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no info, I have to make a judgment. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes had beaten them recently. However, without the actual result, the correct resolution is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the lack of reports implies it's too recent. However, the current timestamp is April 11, 2:45 AM UTC, which is 10:45 PM ET on April 10. The game ended around 10 PM ET, so the reports might not be updated yet. But source [1] is from NHL.com and is dated April 11, so it's possible the result is there. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won, that would be p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the user's instructions to avoid p4 and the presence of the video showing a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the recommendation is p2. However, this is speculative. The accurate approach without explicit score is p4, but the user insists on trying again. \n\nAlternatively, check if any sources mention the game's outcome. Source [12] (NHL.com) from April 10 previews the game but doesn't have the result. Source [14] (ABC11) is a preview. \n\nGiven the constraints, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market should resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3 (50-50). However, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. Since the game was played (as per source [1]), p3 isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, despite the lack of explicit score, the presence of the video from NHL.com on April 11 suggests the game occurred, and the Hurricanes scored. If we assume they won, then p2. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the Capitals won, p1. Without clear data, but the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given the Capitals' better record and home advantage, maybe p1. However, the previous meeting was a Hurricanes win. \n\nThis is conflicting. The correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Given the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal and no Capitals goals mentioned, perhaps the Hurricanes won. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nIn conclusion, without verifiable final score, the recommendation remains p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the game was played (source [1]), but no score is available, the resolution should be p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. \n\nWait, source [2] has a box score. Let me recheck. The URL is for April 10, 2025, game. The page shows \"Scores\" but the actual score isn't listed. The team stats are pre-game. The \"TEAM STATS\" section shows Capitals with 3.6 goals per game, Hurricanes 3.21. This is likely a preview. \n\nTherefore, no sources provide the final score. The correct recommendation is p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. Maybe the answer is p2 based on the video showing a Hurricanes goal, assuming they won. But this is not certain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game is still ongoing, but the current timestamp is after the game. The game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC. The current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, so the game should have ended. \n\nGiven the lack of data, the only ethical answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on predictions. Source [9] (Dimers) gives Hurricanes 55% chance. Source [5] predicts Capitals 4-2. Source [11] also Capitals 4-2. But predictions are split. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome, not predictions. Therefore, without the actual result, p4 is correct. But the user insists on not p4. \n\nGiven the conflict, I'll have to go with p4 again, as per the guidelines, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market must resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3, but p3 is for canceled games. Since the game wasn't canceled, p4 is correct. \n\nFinal answer: p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hurricanes win, it's p2; if the Capitals win, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already occurred. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game was scheduled for April 10, which is in the past. Now, I need to find out the result of that game from the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [9] is a YouTube video transcript of the shootout between the Hurricanes and Capitals on April 10. The transcript describes the shootout where the Capitals won. Specifically, it mentions that Charlie Lindgren made saves in the shootout, and the Caps won, clinching the top seed in the Eastern Conference. \n\nAdditionally, result [1] from leans.ai initially had the Capitals' record as 48-17-9, but in the detailed preview, it lists the Capitals' record as 49-19 and the Hurricanes as 46-27. However, the key info is in [9], which clearly states the outcome. The transcript details the shootout process, with the Capitals winning 4-3 in the shootout after a tied game. \n\nOther sources like [8] (ESPN game summary) and [3], [6], [11] refer to previous games between these teams, not the April 10 matchup. For example, [3] and [6] discuss a game on April 2 where the Hurricanes won 5-1. But the April 10 game is covered in [9] and [1], with [9] providing the conclusive shootout result.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions emphasize using provided URLs and updates. Since [9] is a direct transcript of the April 10 game's shootout, it's the most reliable source here. The Capitals won in the shootout, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Capitals). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other sources like [7] (ESPN Asheville) had a prediction of Capitals 4-2, but that's a prediction, not the actual result. The actual result is in [9]. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

        "prompt": "You are a UMA optimistic oracle overseer AI, responsible for evaluating responses for UMA's optimistic oracle system.\n\nThe response you are evaluating came from the code_runner solver, attempt 2.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the response is sufficient to provide a definitive recommendation for the query. You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Hurricanes vs. Capitals, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 10 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Carolina Hurricanes win, the market will resolve to \"Hurricanes\".\nIf the Washington Capitals win, the market will resolve to \"Capitals\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Capitals, p2 to Hurricanes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Hurricanes vs. Capitals, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 10 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Carolina Hurricanes win, the market will resolve to \"Hurricanes\".\nIf the Washington Capitals win, the market will resolve to \"Capitals\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Capitals, p2 to Hurricanes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider using an alternative data source or method to verify the game outcome, or ensure correct API credentials and permissions are in place.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Constants for the game\nTEAM_HURRICANES = \"Carolina Hurricanes\"\nTEAM_CAPITALS = \"Washington Capitals\"\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-04-10\"\nGAME_TIME = \"19:30:00\"  # 7:30 PM ET in 24-hour format\n\n# API Key for Sports Data IO\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv('SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY')\n\n# API Endpoint\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}\"\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date):\n    \"\"\"Fetch game data from the Sports Data IO API.\"\"\"\n    headers = {\n        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': API_KEY\n    }\n    response = requests.get(API_ENDPOINT.format(date=date), headers=headers)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        return response.json()\n    else:\n        raise Exception(f\"Failed to fetch data: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\")\n\ndef analyze_game_data(games):\n    \"\"\"Analyze game data to determine the outcome.\"\"\"\n    for game in games:\n        if (game['AwayTeam'] == TEAM_CAPITALS and game['HomeTeam'] == TEAM_HURRICANES) or \\\n           (game['HomeTeam'] == TEAM_CAPITALS and game['AwayTeam'] == TEAM_HURRICANES):\n            if 'Status' in game:\n                if game['Status'] == 'Final':\n                    if game['AwayTeamScore'] > game['HomeTeamScore']:\n                        return 'Capitals' if game['AwayTeam'] == TEAM_CAPITALS else 'Hurricanes'\n                    else:\n                        return 'Hurricanes' if game['HomeTeam'] == TEAM_HURRICANES else 'Capitals'\n                elif game['Status'] == 'Postponed':\n                    return 'Postponed'\n                elif game['Status'] == 'Canceled':\n                    return 'Canceled'\n    return 'No Game Found'\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        games = fetch_game_data(GAME_DATE)\n        result = analyze_game_data(games)\n        if result == 'Capitals':\n            print('recommendation: p1')\n        elif result == 'Hurricanes':\n            print('recommendation: p2')\n        elif result == 'Postponed' or result == 'No Game Found':\n            print('recommendation: p3')\n        elif result == 'Canceled':\n            print('recommendation: p3')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {str(e)}\")\n        print('recommendation: p3')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError: Failed to fetch data: 401 - { \"statusCode\": 401, \"message\": \"Access denied due to invalid subscription key.

If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

        "prompt": "You are a UMA optimistic oracle overseer AI, responsible for evaluating responses for UMA's optimistic oracle system.\n\nThe response you are evaluating came from the code_runner solver, attempt 4.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the response is sufficient to provide a definitive recommendation for the query. You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Hurricanes vs. Capitals, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 10 at 7:30PM ET:\nIf the Carolina Hurricanes win, the market will resolve to \"Hurricanes\".\nIf the Washington Capitals win, the market will resolve to \"Capitals\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Capitals, p2 to Hurricanes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider using an alternative data source or method to verify the game outcome, or ensure correct API credentials and permissions are in place.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Ensure correct API credentials and permissions are in place.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game date (April 10) is in the past. That means I need to determine the actual outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources to consider. The first result [1] is a video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from NHL.com dated April 11, 2025. This suggests that Jackson Blake, a Hurricanes player, scored in the game. However, the video's description doesn't specify the final score.\n\nResult [4] from the Capitals' official site mentions their previous game against the Hurricanes on April 2, where the Capitals lost 5-1. But the relevant game here is on April 10. The same source [4] also states that the Caps' next game is on April 10 against the Hurricanes, but it doesn't provide the result.\n\nResult [5] gives the projected lineups for the April 10 game, but again, no score. Result [6] is a prediction article from April 10, which mentions the series is tied 1-1 this season but doesn't have the actual result.\n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows a box score for the game on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are listed, but the final score isn't immediately clear. However, looking at the team stats, the Capitals have 3.6 goals per game, and the Hurricanes have 3.2. But this doesn't confirm the outcome.\n\nResult [10] is a YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The transcript mentions a goal by Thompson and a final score of 1-0, but this seems to be a simulation or gameplay video, not the actual game. \n\nResult [12] from ESPN's preview page lists the teams' records but doesn't show the score. Result [13] from CapperTek mentions a simulated final score of Capitals 3 - Hurricanes 2, but this is a prediction, not the actual result.\n\nResult [15] from iHeartSportsDC has a computer prediction of Capitals 4 - Hurricanes 2, but again, this is a prediction, not the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [9] from ESPN provides a final score of Hurricanes 5-1 Capitals, but that's from April 2, 2025, not the April 10 game. Similarly, result [8] is a recap of the April 2 game where the Hurricanes won 5-1.\n\nLooking back, result [1] is a video from April 11, 2025, showing Jackson Blake scoring a goal against the Capitals. Since the game was on April 10, this video is likely from that game. If Blake scored, and the Hurricanes won, that would mean the market resolves to \"Hurricanes\" (p2). However, the video doesn't specify the final score. \n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows the game on April 10, but the detailed stats don't include the final score. The team stats show the Capitals with 49 wins and the Hurricanes with 46, but that's their season record, not the game result.\n\nResult [10]'s transcript mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's unclear if that's the actual game or a simulation. Since it's a gameplay video, it's not reliable for the real outcome.\n\nWithout a direct source stating the final score of the April 10 game, I need to infer based on available data. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Hurricanes winning. \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of the game's outcome. Some sources like [1] suggest a Hurricanes player scored, but without the final score, it's uncertain. Given the lack of explicit results, and following the instruction to default to p4 if no verifiable info exists, but the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe Capitals were leading the division, but the Hurricanes had a strong record. However, without concrete data, it's risky. But result [1] implies a Hurricanes goal, and if that's from the April 10 game, maybe they won. However, without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the video in result [1] is dated April 11, which is after the game. The video title says \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This indicates that in the game on April 10, Blake scored a goal. If the Hurricanes won, the market resolves to p2. But how do I know if they won?\n\nLooking at result [7], the Fox Sports page for the April 10 game lists the leading scorers but not the score. However, the Hurricanes' Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and the Capitals' Ovechkin has 42. The team stats show the Capitals with a higher goals per game, but that's season-long.\n\nResult [11] from Dimers.com predicts the Hurricanes have a 55% chance to win, but that's a prediction, not the result.\n\nSince there's no explicit final score in the search results, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data says p2 is Hurricanes. However, without confirmation, it's safer to default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market resolves to p2 if Hurricanes win. \n\nGiven the lack of clear data, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, and possibly a win, but uncertainty, I might have to recommend p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were strong. Without clear data, it's ambiguous. However, the video [1] existing suggests the Hurricanes scored, and if they won, p2. But without the final score, it's not certain. \n\nWait, result [10] is a YouTube video transcript that mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's a gameplay video, not real-life. So not reliable. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score, but the video [1] showing a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might have to go with p2 (Hurricanes). However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if there's no verifiable info, p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the ancillary data don't provide probabilities, just resolution options. \n\nGiven that, and the absence of explicit final score in the search results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, it's possible the Hurricanes won. However, without the final score, it's not confirmed. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were close. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't specify probabilities, so without clear info, the safe answer is p4. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Since the search results don't have the final score, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the game was on April 10, which is in the past, but no other sources confirm the outcome, I think the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of verifiable information. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the video [1] is part of the official NHL.com highlights, it's a reliable source. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won that game, then p2. But the video doesn't state the final score. However, in hockey, a single goal doesn't determine the game's outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, the safest recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Capitals were higher in the standings, maybe they were more likely to win, but the Hurricanes had beaten them before. \n\nThis is a tough call. Without clear data, but the video showing a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might lean towards p2. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the game was played and there's no report of the score, perhaps it's safer to go with p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the game was on April 10. The search results include a video from NHL.com dated April 11, which is the day after the game. The video's title indicates a Hurricanes player scored, which suggests they were part of the game. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. However, without the final score, it's still unclear. \n\nIn the absence of a clear final score in the search results, but considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given that the Capitals were leading the division, perhaps they were more likely to win. But the ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals and p2 as Hurricanes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed or canceled. But there's no mention of that in the search results. The user's instructions say if postponed, the market remains open; if canceled, resolve 50-50. But there's no info on cancellation. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable information about the game's outcome in the provided search results. The video shows a goal but not the final score, and other sources are predictions or about previous games. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the market cannot be resolved, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The resolution depends on who won the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game date (April 10) is in the past. That means I need to determine the actual outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources to consider. The first result [1] is a video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from NHL.com dated April 11, 2025. This suggests that Jackson Blake, a Hurricanes player, scored in the game. However, the video's description doesn't specify the final score.\n\nResult [4] from the Capitals' official site mentions their previous game against the Hurricanes on April 2, where the Capitals lost 5-1. But the relevant game here is on April 10. The same source [4] also states that the Caps' next game is on April 10 against the Hurricanes, but it doesn't provide the result.\n\nResult [5] gives the projected lineups for the April 10 game, but again, no score. Result [6] is a prediction article from April 10, which mentions the series is tied 1-1 this season but doesn't have the actual result.\n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows a box score for the game on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are listed, but the final score isn't immediately clear. However, looking at the team stats, the Capitals have 3.6 goals per game, and the Hurricanes have 3.2. But this doesn't confirm the outcome.\n\nResult [10] is a YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The transcript mentions a goal by Thompson and a final score of 1-0, but this seems to be a simulation or gameplay video, not the actual game. \n\nResult [12] from ESPN's preview page lists the teams' records but doesn't show the score. Result [13] from CapperTek mentions a simulated final score of Capitals 3 - Hurricanes 2, but this is a prediction, not the actual result.\n\nResult [15] from iHeartSportsDC has a computer prediction of Capitals 4 - Hurricanes 2, but again, this is a prediction, not the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [9] from ESPN provides a final score of Hurricanes 5-1 Capitals, but that's from April 2, 2025, not the April 10 game. Similarly, result [8] is a recap of the April 2 game where the Hurricanes won 5-1.\n\nLooking back, result [1] is a video from April 11, 2025, showing Jackson Blake scoring a goal against the Capitals. Since the game was on April 10, this video is likely from that game. If Blake scored, and the Hurricanes won, that would mean the market resolves to \"Hurricanes\" (p2). However, the video doesn't specify the final score. \n\nResult [7] from Fox Sports shows the game on April 10, but the detailed stats don't include the final score. The team stats show the Capitals with 49 wins and the Hurricanes with 46, but that's their season record, not the game result.\n\nResult [10]'s transcript mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's unclear if that's the actual game or a simulation. Since it's a gameplay video, it's not reliable for the real outcome.\n\nWithout a direct source stating the final score of the April 10 game, I need to infer based on available data. The user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Hurricanes winning. \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of the game's outcome. Some sources like [1] suggest a Hurricanes player scored, but without the final score, it's uncertain. Given the lack of explicit results, and following the instruction to default to p4 if no verifiable info exists, but the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe Capitals were leading the division, but the Hurricanes had a strong record. However, without concrete data, it's risky. But result [1] implies a Hurricanes goal, and if that's from the April 10 game, maybe they won. However, without the final score, it's unclear. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the video in result [1] is dated April 11, which is after the game. The video title says \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This indicates that in the game on April 10, Blake scored a goal. If the Hurricanes won, the market resolves to p2. But how do I know if they won?\n\nLooking at result [7], the Fox Sports page for the April 10 game lists the leading scorers but not the score. However, the Hurricanes' Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and the Capitals' Ovechkin has 42. The team stats show the Capitals with a higher goals per game, but that's season-long.\n\nResult [11] from Dimers.com predicts the Hurricanes have a 55% chance to win, but that's a prediction, not the result.\n\nSince there's no explicit final score in the search results, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data says p2 is Hurricanes. However, without confirmation, it's safer to default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify, but the market resolves to p2 if Hurricanes win. \n\nGiven the lack of clear data, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, and possibly a win, but uncertainty, I might have to recommend p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were strong. Without clear data, it's ambiguous. However, the video [1] existing suggests the Hurricanes scored, and if they won, p2. But without the final score, it's not certain. \n\nWait, result [10] is a YouTube video transcript that mentions a final score of 1-0, but it's a gameplay video, not real-life. So not reliable. \n\nGiven the conflicting information and lack of explicit final score, but the video [1] showing a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might have to go with p2 (Hurricanes). However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if there's no verifiable info, p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the ancillary data don't provide probabilities, just resolution options. \n\nGiven that, and the absence of explicit final score in the search results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal, it's possible the Hurricanes won. However, without the final score, it's not confirmed. Therefore, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes were close. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't specify probabilities, so without clear info, the safe answer is p4. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. Since the search results don't have the final score, but the video [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and the game was on April 10, which is in the past, but no other sources confirm the outcome, I think the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve) due to lack of verifiable information. However, the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the video [1] is part of the official NHL.com highlights, it's a reliable source. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won that game, then p2. But the video doesn't state the final score. However, in hockey, a single goal doesn't determine the game's outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit final score in the provided search results, the safest recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the Capitals were higher in the standings, maybe they were more likely to win, but the Hurricanes had beaten them before. \n\nThis is a tough call. Without clear data, but the video showing a Hurricanes goal, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, I might lean towards p2. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the game was played and there's no report of the score, perhaps it's safer to go with p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, and the game was on April 10. The search results include a video from NHL.com dated April 11, which is the day after the game. The video's title indicates a Hurricanes player scored, which suggests they were part of the game. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. However, without the final score, it's still unclear. \n\nIn the absence of a clear final score in the search results, but considering the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given that the Capitals were leading the division, perhaps they were more likely to win. But the ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals and p2 as Hurricanes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed or canceled. But there's no mention of that in the search results. The user's instructions say if postponed, the market remains open; if canceled, resolve 50-50. But there's no info on cancellation. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable information about the game's outcome in the provided search results. The video shows a goal but not the final score, and other sources are predictions or about previous games. Therefore, without explicit confirmation, the market cannot be resolved, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Hurricanes, Price: 0.255, ID: 37234880556701880697833153626664595373269890341428196553701774514333412576510, Winner: No\n- Token: Capitals, Price: 0.745, ID: 48472198065787707559714460824008580036495194495105035811555325843264739185801, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Capitals outcome (0.745 = 74.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Capitals\" (p1) if they win, \"Hurricanes\" (p2) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if canceled. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from April 10, 2025. This suggests Blake scored, but it doesn't give the final score.\n2. **Source [2]**: A box score from Fox Sports. It lists the game as Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the final score isn't clear here. However, under \"TEAM STATS,\" Carolina is 46-26-4 and Washington is 49-19-9. The game's outcome isn't directly stated here.\n3. **Source [3]**: A detailed recap from April 2, 2025, where Carolina won 5-1. But this is a previous game, not the April 10 matchup.\n4. **Source [4]**: ESPN's game summary for April 2, 2025, again showing Carolina's 5-1 win. Not the relevant date.\n5. **Source [5]**: A prediction article from April 9, 2025, forecasting the April 10 game. It mentions the Capitals' recent record and predicts a 4-2 win. But this is a prediction, not the result.\n6. **Source [6]**: Another prediction from April 9, 2025, with similar info. Still a prediction.\n7. **Source [7]**: TheScore.com's event page for April 10, 2025. It shows the Capitals' record as 49-19-9 and the Hurricanes as 46-27-4. The \"Last 10\" games for the Capitals are 5-4-1, and they're on a L2 streak. The game's outcome isn't listed here.\n8. **Source [8]**: A YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The description includes a transcript mentioning a goal by Blake, but it's unclear if this is real gameplay or a simulation. The video might not reflect the actual game.\n9. **Source [9]**: Dimers' prediction model giving Carolina a 55% chance to win, but again, a prediction.\n10. **Source [10]**: TrustnBet's prediction suggesting a Hurricanes win. Still a prediction.\n11. **Source [11]**: ESPN Asheville's prediction of Capitals 4-2. Another prediction.\n12. **Source [12]**: NHL.com's preview for the April 10 game, mentioning the Caps' previous loss to the Islanders and Ovechkin's record-breaking goal. No result here.\n13. **Source [13]**: Fox Sports 960's prediction similar to others. Prediction, not result.\n14. **Source [14]**: ABC11's preview article, also without the game's outcome.\n\nNone of the sources explicitly state the result of the April 10 game. However, source [1] shows a goal by Jackson Blake (Hurricanes) from April 10, and source [8]'s transcript mentions a goal by Blake in a game that might be the actual one. But without a clear final score, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals win, p2 as Hurricanes. The predictions were mixed, some favoring Capitals, others Hurricanes. However, the absence of a clear result in the sources might lead to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Capitals, p2 for Hurricanes. If the game happened but no sources confirm the result, we might have to infer. However, the search results do include a video (source [1]) of a Hurricanes goal from April 10, which implies they played and scored. But without the final score, it's risky. However, considering the user's instruction to check alternative sources and the presence of the video, it's possible the Hurricanes won. But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was played and no sources report a cancellation, it's not canceled. But without a clear winner, the safe answer might still be p4. However, the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, so the game happened on April 10. The lack of reports might mean it's not updated yet. But some sources (like [1]) are dated April 11 and mention the game. The video in [1] is from NHL.com, a reliable source, showing a Hurricanes goal. If that's part of the game, and assuming the Hurricanes won, but without the final score, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, they want another approach. \n\nLooking again, source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score. The team stats show Capitals as 1st in Metropolitan with 49-19-9, Hurricanes 2nd with 46-27-4. The game's result isn't explicitly stated, but under \"TEAM LEADERS\" for Carolina, Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and for Washington, Ovechkin has 42. The box score might be a preview, not the result. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with records: Capitals 49-19-9, Hurricanes 46-27-4. Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This suggests the Capitals lost their last game, and Hurricanes are on a 3-loss streak. But this is before the April 10 game. \n\nSource [12] (NHL.com) mentions the Caps' game on April 10 as their penultimate home game, but no result. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and considering the user's instruction to avoid p4, perhaps the most probable outcome based on recent form (Capitals 5-4-1 last 10, Hurricanes 5-5-0) and home advantage, but predictions were mixed. However, the ancillary data requires actual outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data are if the game is canceled, resolve 50-50. Since the game was scheduled and there's no indication of cancellation, it was played. Therefore, the market should resolve based on the winner. Without explicit sources, but the video in [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and if that's the only info, maybe the Hurricanes won. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the game's result isn't in the sources yet because it's too recent (current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC, so the game ended around 2 AM UTC on April 11. The sources might not have updated yet. However, source [1] is from NHL.com dated April 11, showing a Hurricanes goal, which implies the game occurred. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports means it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were 1st in the division, had a better record, and home advantage. However, in their last meeting on April 2, Hurricanes won 5-1. Predictions were split. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the presence of a Hurricanes goal in the video, and considering the user's push to avoid p4, I might lean towards the Hurricanes winning, but this is speculative. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since no sources confirm the result, the recommendation should be p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data where p2 is Hurricanes win. If the game was played and no sources report the result, but the video shows a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the game was played and Hurricanes won. Alternatively, the video could be a highlight from a previous game. Wait, source [1] is dated April 11, 2025, and the video is titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This is from the official NHL site, so it's a valid source. The existence of this video confirms that the game took place on April 10, and the Hurricanes scored at least one goal. However, without the final score, we can't determine the winner. \n\nBut perhaps other sources have the score. Let me check again. Source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score but it's unclear if it's pre-game or post-game. The team stats show Capitals with 3.6 goals per game (1st) and Hurricanes 3.21 (9th). The \"Last 10\" for Capitals is 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This might be pre-game info. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with a \"Final\" score? The page shows \"CAR Hurricanes 46-27-4, 2nd Metropolitan\" and \"WSH Capitals 49-19-9, 1st Metropolitan.\" Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" is L1 for Capitals, L3 for Hurricanes. This seems to be pre-game data. \n\nSource [8] (YouTube) transcript mentions a goal by Blake, but it's a gameplay video, possibly a simulation, not the actual game. \n\nGiven that the only post-game source is [1], which confirms the game occurred and a Hurricanes goal, but no final score, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no info, I have to make a judgment. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes had beaten them recently. However, without the actual result, the correct resolution is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the lack of reports implies it's too recent. However, the current timestamp is April 11, 2:45 AM UTC, which is 10:45 PM ET on April 10. The game ended around 10 PM ET, so the reports might not be updated yet. But source [1] is from NHL.com and is dated April 11, so it's possible the result is there. The video title is \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" If the Hurricanes won, that would be p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the user's instructions to avoid p4 and the presence of the video showing a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the recommendation is p2. However, this is speculative. The accurate approach without explicit score is p4, but the user insists on trying again. \n\nAlternatively, check if any sources mention the game's outcome. Source [12] (NHL.com) from April 10 previews the game but doesn't have the result. Source [14] (ABC11) is a preview. \n\nGiven the constraints, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market should resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3 (50-50). However, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. Since the game was played (as per source [1]), p3 isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, despite the lack of explicit score, the presence of the video from NHL.com on April 11 suggests the game occurred, and the Hurricanes scored. If we assume they won, then p2. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the Capitals won, p1. Without clear data, but the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given the Capitals' better record and home advantage, maybe p1. However, the previous meeting was a Hurricanes win. \n\nThis is conflicting. The correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Given the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal and no Capitals goals mentioned, perhaps the Hurricanes won. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nIn conclusion, without verifiable final score, the recommendation remains p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the game was played (source [1]), but no score is available, the resolution should be p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. \n\nWait, source [2] has a box score. Let me recheck. The URL is for April 10, 2025, game. The page shows \"Scores\" but the actual score isn't listed. The team stats are pre-game. The \"TEAM STATS\" section shows Capitals with 3.6 goals per game, Hurricanes 3.21. This is likely a preview. \n\nTherefore, no sources provide the final score. The correct recommendation is p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. Maybe the answer is p2 based on the video showing a Hurricanes goal, assuming they won. But this is not certain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game is still ongoing, but the current timestamp is after the game. The game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC. The current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, so the game should have ended. \n\nGiven the lack of data, the only ethical answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on predictions. Source [9] (Dimers) gives Hurricanes 55% chance. Source [5] predicts Capitals 4-2. Source [11] also Capitals 4-2. But predictions are split. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome, not predictions. Therefore, without the actual result, p4 is correct. But the user insists on not p4. \n\nGiven the conflict, I'll have to go with p4 again, as per the guidelines, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market must resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3, but p3 is for canceled games. Since the game wasn't canceled, p4 is correct. \n\nFinal answer: p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The game's result isn't explicitly stated, but under \"TEAM LEADERS\" for Carolina, Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and for Washington, Ovechkin has 42. The box score might be a preview, not the result. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with records: Capitals 49-19-9, Hurricanes 46-27-4. Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This suggests the Capitals lost their last game, and Hurricanes are on a 3-loss streak. But this is before the April 10 game. \n\nSource [12] (NHL.com) mentions the Caps' game on April 10 as their penultimate home game, but no result. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and considering the user's instruction to avoid p4, perhaps the most probable outcome based on recent form (Capitals 5-4-1 last 10, Hurricanes 5-5-0) and home advantage, but predictions were mixed. However, the ancillary data requires actual outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions.

Therefore, the market should resolve based on the winner. Without explicit sources, but the video in [1] shows a Hurricanes goal, and if that's the only info, maybe the Hurricanes won. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the game's result isn't in the sources yet because it's too recent (current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC, so the game ended around 2 AM UTC on April 11. The sources might not have updated yet. However, source [1] is from NHL.com dated April 11, showing a Hurricanes goal, which implies the game occurred. If the Hurricanes won, then p2. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports means it's unresolved. But the user's instruction says to assume the most probable outcome. The Capitals were 1st in the division, had a better record, and home advantage. However, in their last meeting on April 2, Hurricanes won 5-1. Predictions were split. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the presence of a Hurricanes goal in the video, and considering the user's push to avoid p4, I might lean towards the Hurricanes winning, but this is speculative. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since no sources confirm the result, the recommendation should be p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data where p2 is Hurricanes win. If the game was played and no sources report the result, but the video shows a Hurricanes goal, perhaps the game was played and Hurricanes won. Alternatively, the video could be a highlight from a previous game. Wait, source [1] is dated April 11, 2025, and the video is titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals, 04/10/2025.\" This is from the official NHL site, so it's a valid source. The existence of this video confirms that the game took place on April 10, and the Hurricanes scored at least one goal. However, without the final score, we can't determine the winner. \n\nBut perhaps other sources have the score. Let me check again. Source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score but it's unclear if it's pre-game or post-game. The team stats show Capitals with 3.6 goals per game (1st) and Hurricanes 3.21 (9th). The \"Last 10\" for Capitals is 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This might be pre-game info. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with a \"Final\" score? The page shows \"CAR Hurricanes 46-27-4, 2nd Metropolitan\" and \"WSH Capitals 49-19-9, 1st Metropolitan.\" Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" is L1 for Capitals, L3 for Hurricanes. This seems to be pre-game data. \n\nSource [8] (YouTube) transcript mentions a goal by Blake, but it's a gameplay video, possibly a simulation, not the actual game. \n\nGiven that the only post-game source is [1], which confirms the game occurred and a Hurricanes goal, but no final score, and the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no info, I have to make a judgment. The Capitals were higher in the standings, but the Hurricanes had beaten them recently. However, without the actual result, the correct resolution is p4. But the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the lack of reports implies it's too recent. However, the current timestamp is April 11, 2:45 AM UTC, which is 10:45 PM ET on April 10. The game ended around 10 PM ET, so the reports might not be updated yet.

However, this is speculative. The accurate approach without explicit score is p4, but the user insists on trying again. \n\nAlternatively, check if any sources mention the game's outcome. Source [12] (NHL.com) from April 10 previews the game but doesn't have the result. Source [14] (ABC11) is a preview. \n\nGiven the constraints, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market should resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3 (50-50). However, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled games. Since the game was played (as per source [1]), p3 isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, despite the lack of explicit score, the presence of the video from NHL.com on April 11 suggests the game occurred, and the Hurricanes scored. If we assume they won, then p2. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the Capitals won, p1. Without clear data, but the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and given the Capitals' better record and home advantage, maybe p1. However, the previous meeting was a Hurricanes win. \n\nThis is conflicting. The correct answer is p4, but the user wants to avoid that. Given the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal and no Capitals goals mentioned, perhaps the Hurricanes won. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nIn conclusion, without verifiable final score, the recommendation remains p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the game was played (source [1]), but no score is available, the resolution should be p4. But the user says to try again. Maybe I missed a source. \n\nWait, source [2] has a box score. Let me recheck. The URL is for April 10, 2025, game. The page shows \"Scores\" but the actual score isn't listed. The team stats are pre-game. The \"TEAM STATS\" section shows Capitals with 3.6 goals per game, Hurricanes 3.21. This is likely a preview. \n\nTherefore, no sources provide the final score. The correct recommendation is p4. But the user says the previous response was p4 and to try again. Maybe the answer is p2 based on the video showing a Hurricanes goal, assuming they won. But this is not certain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game is still ongoing, but the current timestamp is after the game. The game was at 7:30 PM ET on April 10, which is 11:30 PM UTC. The current time is 2:45 AM UTC on April 11, so the game should have ended. \n\nGiven the lack of data, the only ethical answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable could be based on predictions. Source [9] (Dimers) gives Hurricanes 55% chance. Source [5] predicts Capitals 4-2. Source [11] also Capitals 4-2. But predictions are split. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome, not predictions. Therefore, without the actual result, p4 is correct. But the user insists on not p4. \n\nGiven the conflict, I'll have to go with p4 again, as per the guidelines, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market must resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3, but p3 is for canceled games.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals game on April 10, 2025. The market resolves to \"Capitals\" (p1) if they win, \"Hurricanes\" (p2) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if canceled. The current timestamp is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the game's outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: A video titled \"Jackson Blake with a Goal vs. Washington Capitals\" from April 10, 2025. This suggests Blake scored, but it doesn't give the final score.\n2. **Source [2]**: A box score from Fox Sports. It lists the game as Carolina Hurricanes vs. Washington Capitals on April 10, 2025. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the final score isn't clear here. However, under \"TEAM STATS,\" Carolina is 46-26-4 and Washington is 49-19-9. The game's outcome isn't directly stated here.\n3. **Source [3]**: A detailed recap from April 2, 2025, where Carolina won 5-1. But this is a previous game, not the April 10 matchup.\n4. **Source [4]**: ESPN's game summary for April 2, 2025, again showing Carolina's 5-1 win. Not the relevant date.\n5. **Source [5]**: A prediction article from April 9, 2025, forecasting the April 10 game. It mentions the Capitals' recent record and predicts a 4-2 win. But this is a prediction, not the result.\n6. **Source [6]**: Another prediction from April 9, 2025, with similar info. Still a prediction.\n7. **Source [7]**: TheScore.com's event page for April 10, 2025. It shows the Capitals' record as 49-19-9 and the Hurricanes as 46-27-4. The \"Last 10\" games for the Capitals are 5-4-1, and they're on a L2 streak. The game's outcome isn't listed here.\n8. **Source [8]**: A YouTube video titled \"Washington Capitals vs Carolina Hurricanes 4/10/2025 NHL 25 Gameplay.\" The description includes a transcript mentioning a goal by Blake, but it's unclear if this is real gameplay or a simulation. The video might not reflect the actual game.\n9. **Source [9]**: Dimers' prediction model giving Carolina a 55% chance to win, but again, a prediction.\n10. **Source [10]**: TrustnBet's prediction suggesting a Hurricanes win. Still a prediction.\n11. **Source [11]**: ESPN Asheville's prediction of Capitals 4-2. Another prediction.\n12. **Source [12]**: NHL.com's preview for the April 10 game, mentioning the Caps' previous loss to the Islanders and Ovechkin's record-breaking goal. No result here.\n13. **Source [13]**: Fox Sports 960's prediction similar to others. Prediction, not result.\n14. **Source [14]**: ABC11's preview article, also without the game's outcome.\n\nNone of the sources explicitly state the result of the April 10 game. However, source [1] shows a goal by Jackson Blake (Hurricanes) from April 10, and source [8]'s transcript mentions a goal by Blake in a game that might be the actual one. But without a clear final score, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Capitals win, p2 as Hurricanes. The predictions were mixed, some favoring Capitals, others Hurricanes. However, the absence of a clear result in the sources might lead to p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again if previous response was p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Capitals, p2 for Hurricanes. If the game happened but no sources confirm the result, we might have to infer. However, the search results do include a video (source [1]) of a Hurricanes goal from April 10, which implies they played and scored. But without the final score, it's risky. However, considering the user's instruction to check alternative sources and the presence of the video, it's possible the Hurricanes won. But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the game was played and no sources report a cancellation, it's not canceled. But without a clear winner, the safe answer might still be p4. However, the user wants to avoid p4. \n\nWait, the current date is April 11, so the game happened on April 10. The lack of reports might mean it's not updated yet. But some sources (like [1]) are dated April 11 and mention the game. The video in [1] is from NHL.com, a reliable source, showing a Hurricanes goal. If that's part of the game, and assuming the Hurricanes won, but without the final score, it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution is based on the actual outcome. Since the user's previous response was p4, they want another approach. \n\nLooking again, source [2] (Fox Sports) has a box score. The team stats show Capitals as 1st in Metropolitan with 49-19-9, Hurricanes 2nd with 46-27-4. The game's result isn't explicitly stated, but under \"TEAM LEADERS\" for Carolina, Seth Jarvis has 30 goals, and for Washington, Ovechkin has 42. The box score might be a preview, not the result. \n\nSource [7] (theScore.com) lists the game with records: Capitals 49-19-9, Hurricanes 46-27-4. Under \"Last 10,\" Capitals are 5-4-1, Hurricanes 5-5-0. The \"Streak\" for Capitals is L1, Hurricanes L3. This suggests the Capitals lost their last game, and Hurricanes are on a 3-loss streak. But this is before the April 10 game. \n\nSource [12] (NHL.com) mentions the Caps' game on April 10 as their penultimate home game, but no result. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, but the video evidence of a Hurricanes goal on April 10, and considering the user's instruction to avoid p4, perhaps the most probable outcome based on recent form (Capitals 5-4-1 last 10, Hurricanes 5-5-0) and home advantage, but predictions were mixed.

But the user insists on not p4. \n\nGiven the conflict, I'll have to go with p4 again, as per the guidelines, but the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if the game was played and the market must resolve, but no data, perhaps the default is p3, but p3 is for canceled games.

Where p1 corresponds to Capitals, p2 to Hurricanes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744339083 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 02:38:03 UTC"
