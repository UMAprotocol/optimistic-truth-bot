  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744343922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 03:58:42 UTC",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Nashville Predators and Utah Hockey Club on April 10, 2025. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened. I need to determine who won to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. Result [4] is a box score from CBS Sports dated April 10, 2025. It shows that Utah scored a goal by Dylan Guenther in the third period, assisted by Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller. However, the box score snippets don't provide the final score. \n\nLooking at result [7], the NHL.com article from the Predators mentions their game on April 10 against Utah. It references their previous win against the Islanders but doesn't state the outcome of the Utah game. \n\nResult [8] from The Score lists the game as occurring on April 10, but the team stats and comparison don't include the result. Result [9] and [10] are predictions made before the game, favoring Utah, but they don't report the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [4] has a section titled \"Utah, Predators both look to build off seven-goal outbursts\" which mentions Utah's 7-1 win over Seattle and Nashville's 7-6 OT win over the Islanders. But that's about their previous games, not the head-to-head on April 10. \n\nResult [2] from KSL.com, dated April 9, previews the game but doesn't have the result. The same with result [1] and [6]. \n\nHmm, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final score of the April 10 game between Nashville and Utah. However, result [4] includes a detailed play-by-play for the game, showing Utah scoring a goal at 05:42 of the third period. But without the full context, it's unclear if that was the winning goal or part of a larger score. \n\nSince the current date is April 11, the game has already taken place, but the available sources don't provide the final result. The user's ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions in results [9] and [10] gave Utah a 60% chance to win. However, without verified sources confirming the outcome, I can't definitively say Utah won. \n\nBut wait, result [4] is a box score from the game. Let me check again. The play-by-play shows Utah scoring a goal in the third period, but there's no indication of the final score. The lack of explicit final score in the provided context means I can't confirm the outcome. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions pointed to Utah, so I might resolve to p1 (Utah). However, the user's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah and p2 as Predators. But the instructions also say if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

Therefore, I should default to p4. But wait, the user's resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5 (canceled), but the market resolves to p4 if it's unresolved. Wait, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled, but the resolution conditions are p1: Utah, p2: Predators, p3: 0.5. However, the user's personalization says if the event has occurred but no info, assume most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming, I can't be certain. Since the event date is in the past and no sources confirm the result, the correct resolution is p4 (unknown).

Since the actual result isn't in the search results, but the predictions are, maybe the user expects to use the predictions? However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs and heavily bias towards them. The actual result isn't present, so the market can't be resolved definitively. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the current date is after the event and no sources contradict, but the predictions suggest Utah, the resolution would be p1.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744343922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 03:58:42 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Nashville Predators and Utah Hockey Club on April 10, 2025. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened. I need to determine who won to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. Result [4] is a box score from CBS Sports dated April 10, 2025. It shows that Utah scored a goal by Dylan Guenther in the third period, assisted by Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller. However, the box score snippets don't provide the final score. \n\nLooking at result [7], the NHL.com article from the Predators mentions their game on April 10 against Utah. It references their previous win against the Islanders but doesn't state the outcome of the Utah game. \n\nResult [8] from The Score lists the game as occurring on April 10, but the team stats and comparison don't include the result. Result [9] and [10] are predictions made before the game, favoring Utah, but they don't report the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [4] has a section titled \"Utah, Predators both look to build off seven-goal outbursts\" which mentions Utah's 7-1 win over Seattle and Nashville's 7-6 OT win over the Islanders. But that's about their previous games, not the head-to-head on April 10. \n\nResult [2] from KSL.com, dated April 9, previews the game but doesn't have the result. The same with result [1] and [6]. \n\nHmm, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final score of the April 10 game between Nashville and Utah. However, result [4] includes a detailed play-by-play for the game, showing Utah scoring a goal at 05:42 of the third period. But without the full context, it's unclear if that was the winning goal or part of a larger score. \n\nSince the current date is April 11, the game has already taken place, but the available sources don't provide the final result. The user's ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions in results [9] and [10] gave Utah a 60% chance to win. However, without verified sources confirming the outcome, I can't definitively say Utah won. \n\nBut wait, result [4] is a box score from the game. Let me check again. The play-by-play shows Utah scoring a goal in the third period, but there's no indication of the final score. The lack of explicit final score in the provided context means I can't confirm the outcome. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions pointed to Utah, so I might resolve to p1 (Utah). However, the user's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah and p2 as Predators. But the instructions also say if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the search results don't provide the outcome, so I can't verify. Therefore, I should default to p4. But wait, the user's resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5 (canceled), but the market resolves to p4 if it's unresolved. Wait, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled, but the resolution conditions are p1: Utah, p2: Predators, p3: 0.5. However, the user's personalization says if the event has occurred but no info, assume most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming, I can't be certain. Since the event date is in the past and no sources confirm the result, the correct resolution is p4 (unknown). But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. The predictions suggested Utah, but without confirmation, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided search results. Since none of the search results confirm the outcome, I have to resolve to p4. But wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, even without sources, I should infer based on the conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah, p2 as Predators. The predictions in the search results (sources [9] and [10]) indicate Utah was favored. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Utah (p1). But the user's instructions say to use the provided search results. Since the actual result isn't in the search results, but the predictions are, maybe the user expects to use the predictions? However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs and heavily bias towards them. The actual result isn't present, so the market can't be resolved definitively. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the current date is after the event and no sources contradict, but the predictions suggest Utah, the resolution would be p1. However, the user's instructions also say that if the event has occurred but no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. Therefore, despite the lack of explicit confirmation, the resolution would be p1 (Utah). But I need to be certain. Let me check again. The search results include a box score [4] that has play-by-play up to the third period but doesn't show the final score. Without the final score, I can't confirm. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4 because the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if no info. The predictions in the sources suggest Utah was likely to win, so p1. But the user's instructions require using the provided search results. Since the actual result isn't there, but the event date is past, I have to go with p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, even without sources, assume the most probable. The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah. The predictions in the search results (sources [9] and [10]) indicate Utah was favored. Therefore, the resolution is p1. But the user's instructions also say to use the provided URLs. Since the actual result isn't in the URLs, but the predictions are, maybe the resolution is p1. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since there's none, but the instructions say to assume most probable, which is Utah, so p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Predators, Price: 0.63, ID: 64945816924127288465850524130172479399873471227707710132792319549770378063850, Winner: No\n- Token: Utah, Price: 0.37, ID: 7246257645263245162871237631705195953529280693590914144512183703466957164164, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Predators, but not decisively (0.630 vs 0.370)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Nashville Predators and Utah Hockey Club on April 10, 2025. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened. I need to determine who won to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. Result [4] is a box score from CBS Sports dated April 10, 2025. It shows that Utah scored a goal by Dylan Guenther in the third period, assisted by Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller. However, the box score snippets don't provide the final score. \n\nLooking at result [7], the NHL.com article from the Predators mentions their game on April 10 against Utah. It references their previous win against the Islanders but doesn't state the outcome of the Utah game. \n\nResult [8] from The Score lists the game as occurring on April 10, but the team stats and comparison don't include the result. Result [9] and [10] are predictions made before the game, favoring Utah, but they don't report the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [4] has a section titled \"Utah, Predators both look to build off seven-goal outbursts\" which mentions Utah's 7-1 win over Seattle and Nashville's 7-6 OT win over the Islanders. But that's about their previous games, not the head-to-head on April 10. \n\nResult [2] from KSL.com, dated April 9, previews the game but doesn't have the result. The same with result [1] and [6]. \n\nHmm, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final score of the April 10 game between Nashville and Utah. However, result [4] includes a detailed play-by-play for the game, showing Utah scoring a goal at 05:42 of the third period. But without the full context, it's unclear if that was the winning goal or part of a larger score. \n\nSince the current date is April 11, the game has already taken place, but the available sources don't provide the final result. The user's ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions in results [9] and [10] gave Utah a 60% chance to win. However, without verified sources confirming the outcome, I can't definitively say Utah won. \n\nBut wait, result [4] is a box score from the game. Let me check again. The play-by-play shows Utah scoring a goal in the third period, but there's no indication of the final score. The lack of explicit final score in the provided context means I can't confirm the outcome. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions pointed to Utah, so I might resolve to p1 (Utah). However, the user's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah and p2 as Predators. But the instructions also say if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the search results don't provide the outcome, so I can't verify. Therefore, I should default to p4. But wait, the user's resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5 (canceled), but the market resolves to p4 if it's unresolved. Wait, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled, but the resolution conditions are p1: Utah, p2: Predators, p3: 0.5. However, the user's personalization says if the event has occurred but no info, assume most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming, I can't be certain. Since the event date is in the past and no sources confirm the result, the correct resolution is p4 (unknown). But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. The predictions suggested Utah, but without confirmation, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided search results. Since none of the search results confirm the outcome, I have to resolve to p4. But wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, even without sources, I should infer based on the conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah, p2 as Predators. The predictions in the search results (sources [9] and [10]) indicate Utah was favored. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Utah (p1). But the user's instructions say to use the provided search results. Since the actual result isn't in the search results, but the predictions are, maybe the user expects to use the predictions? However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs and heavily bias towards them. The actual result isn't present, so the market can't be resolved definitively. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the current date is after the event and no sources contradict, but the predictions suggest Utah, the resolution would be p1. However, the user's instructions also say that if the event has occurred but no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. Therefore, despite the lack of explicit confirmation, the resolution would be p1 (Utah). But I need to be certain. Let me check again. The search results include a box score [4] that has play-by-play up to the third period but doesn't show the final score. Without the final score, I can't confirm. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4 because the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if no info. The predictions in the sources suggest Utah was likely to win, so p1. But the user's instructions require using the provided search results. Since the actual result isn't there, but the event date is past, I have to go with p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, even without sources, assume the most probable. The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah. The predictions in the search results (sources [9] and [10]) indicate Utah was favored. Therefore, the resolution is p1. But the user's instructions also say to use the provided URLs. Since the actual result isn't in the URLs, but the predictions are, maybe the resolution is p1. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since there's none, but the instructions say to assume most probable, which is Utah, so p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Predators, Price: 0.63, ID: 64945816924127288465850524130172479399873471227707710132792319549770378063850, Winner: No\n- Token: Utah, Price: 0.37, ID: 7246257645263245162871237631705195953529280693590914144512183703466957164164, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Predators, but not decisively (0.630 vs 0.370)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

        "prompt": "You are a UMA optimistic oracle overseer AI, responsible for evaluating responses for UMA's optimistic oracle system.\n\nThe response you are evaluating came from the code_runner solver, attempt 1.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the response is sufficient to provide a definitive recommendation for the query. You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Predators vs. Utah, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 10 at 9:00PM ET:\nIf the Nashville Predators win, the market will resolve to \"Predators\".\nIf the Utah win, the market will resolve to \"Utah\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Utah, p2 to Predators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744343922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 03:58:42 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Check if API key is available\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\n        \"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY not found in environment variables. \"\n        \"Please add it to your .env file.\"\n    )\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Predators\": \"p2\",  # Nashville Predators win maps to p2\n    \"Utah\": \"p1\",       # Utah win maps to p1\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",      # Game canceled or postponed without resolution maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\ndef fetch_game_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified NHL game.\n\n    Returns:\n        Game data dictionary or None if not found\n    \"\"\"\n    date = \"2025-04-10\"\n    home_team = \"Predators\"\n    away_team = \"Utah\"\n\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching game data for {away_team} vs {home_team} on {date}\")\n\n    # Use the exact format from the API documentation with key as query parameter\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}?key={API_KEY}\"\n\n    logger.debug(f\"Using API endpoint: {url}\")\n\n    try:\n        logger.debug(\"Sending API request\")\n        response = requests.get(url)\n\n        if response.status_code == 404:\n            logger.warning(\n                f\"No data found for {date}.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

        "prompt": "You are a UMA optimistic oracle overseer AI, responsible for evaluating responses for UMA's optimistic oracle system.\n\nThe response you are evaluating came from the code_runner solver, attempt 2.\n\nYour task is to determine whether the response is sufficient to provide a definitive recommendation for the query. You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Predators vs. Utah, description: In the upcoming NHL game, scheduled for April 10 at 9:00PM ET:\nIf the Nashville Predators win, the market will resolve to \"Predators\".\nIf the Utah win, the market will resolve to \"Utah\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Utah, p2 to Predators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744343922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 03:58:42 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\nimport json\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Constants for the game\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-04-10\"\nGAME_TIME = \"21:00:00\"  # 9:00 PM ET\nTEAMS = [\"Nashville Predators\", \"Utah\"]  # Assuming Utah represents a team, typically NHL does not have a team named \"Utah\"\n\n# API Key for Sports Data IO\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv('SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY')\n\n# Endpoint for NHL scores (Note: Adjust the endpoint as per the actual API documentation)\nAPI_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}\"\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for a specific date from the Sports Data IO API.\n    \"\"\"\n    headers = {\n        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': API_KEY\n    }\n    url = API_ENDPOINT.format(date=date)\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        return response.json()\n    else:\n        response.raise_for_status()\n\ndef analyze_game_data(games):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the list of games to find the outcome of the specific game between Nashville Predators and Utah.\n    \"\"\"\n    for game in games:\n        if \"Nashville Predators\" in game['HomeTeam'] and \"Utah\" in game['AwayTeam']:\n            if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                if game['HomeTeamScore'] > game['AwayTeamScore']:\n                    return \"Predators\"\n                else:\n                    return \"Utah\"\n            elif game['Status'] == \"Postponed\":\n                return \"Postponed\"\n            elif game['Status'] == \"Canceled\":\n                return \"Canceled\"\n    return \"No Game Found\"\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        games_on_date = fetch_game_data(GAME_DATE)\n        result = analyze_game_data(games_on_date)\n        if result == \"Predators\":\n            print(\"recommendation: p2\")\n        elif result == \"Utah\":\n            print(\"recommendation: p1\")\n        elif result == \"Postponed\":\n            print(\"recommendation: p4\")  # Market remains open\n        elif result == \"Canceled\":\n            print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Market resolves 50-50\n        else:\n            print(\"recommendation: p4\")  # No game found, unable to resolve\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p4\")  # Unable to resolve due to error\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nAn error occurred: 401 Client Error: Access Denied for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-04-10\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744343922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 03:58:42 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Predators, Price: 0.63, ID: 64945816924127288465850524130172479399873471227707710132792319549770378063850, Winner: No\n- Token: Utah, Price: 0.37, ID: 7246257645263245162871237631705195953529280693590914144512183703466957164164, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Predators, but not decisively (0.630 vs 0.370)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744343922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 03:58:42 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please check and update the API credentials or permissions to ensure successful data retrieval. Alternatively, consider using a different data source or method to obtain the game results.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure API credentials are active and correct. Consider adding error handling to provide more detailed feedback on why data retrieval may have failed. Check if the game was indeed played, postponed, or canceled by consulting alternative reliable sources.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\ndef fetch_game_result():\n    load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file\n    api_key = os.getenv('SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY')\n    url = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-04-10\"\n    headers = {\n        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': api_key\n    }\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n        \n        for game in games:\n            if 'Nashville Predators' in game['HomeTeam'] and 'Utah' in game['AwayTeam']:\n                if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                    home_score = game['HomeTeamScore']\n                    away_score = game['AwayTeamScore']\n                    if home_score > away_score:\n                        return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Predators win\n                    elif away_score > home_score:\n                        return \"recommendation: p1\"  # Utah wins\n                elif game['Status'] == \"Postponed\":\n                    return \"recommendation: p4\"  # Game postponed\n                elif game['Status'] == \"Canceled\":\n                    return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Game canceled, resolve 50-50\n        return \"recommendation: p4\"  # No game found or future game\n    except requests.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to fetch data or API error occurred: {e}\")\n        return \"recommendation: p4\"  # Unable to fetch data\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(fetch_game_result())\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nFailed to fetch data or API error occurred: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-04-10\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Nashville Predators and Utah Hockey Club on April 10, 2025. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened. I need to determine who won to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. Result [4] is a box score from CBS Sports dated April 10, 2025. It shows that Utah scored a goal by Dylan Guenther in the third period, assisted by Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller. However, the box score snippets don't provide the final score. \n\nLooking at result [7], the NHL.com article from the Predators mentions their game on April 10 against Utah. It references their previous win against the Islanders but doesn't state the outcome of the Utah game. \n\nResult [8] from The Score lists the game as occurring on April 10, but the team stats and comparison don't include the result. Result [9] and [10] are predictions made before the game, favoring Utah, but they don't report the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [4] has a section titled \"Utah, Predators both look to build off seven-goal outbursts\" which mentions Utah's 7-1 win over Seattle and Nashville's 7-6 OT win over the Islanders. But that's about their previous games, not the head-to-head on April 10. \n\nResult [2] from KSL.com, dated April 9, previews the game but doesn't have the result. The same with result [1] and [6]. \n\nHmm, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final score of the April 10 game between Nashville and Utah. However, result [4] includes a detailed play-by-play for the game, showing Utah scoring a goal at 05:42 of the third period. But without the full context, it's unclear if that was the winning goal or part of a larger score. \n\nSince the current date is April 11, the game has already taken place, but the available sources don't provide the final result. The user's ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions in results [9] and [10] gave Utah a 60% chance to win. However, without verified sources confirming the outcome, I can't definitively say Utah won. \n\nBut wait, result [4] is a box score from the game. Let me check again. The play-by-play shows Utah scoring a goal in the third period, but there's no indication of the final score. The lack of explicit final score in the provided context means I can't confirm the outcome. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions pointed to Utah, so I might resolve to p1 (Utah). However, the user's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah and p2 as Predators. But the instructions also say if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

Therefore, I should default to p4. But wait, the user's resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5 (canceled), but the market resolves to p4 if it's unresolved. Wait, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled, but the resolution conditions are p1: Utah, p2: Predators, p3: 0.5. However, the user's personalization says if the event has occurred but no info, assume most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming, I can't be certain. Since the event date is in the past and no sources confirm the result, the correct resolution is p4 (unknown). But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. The predictions suggested Utah, but without confirmation, it's risky.

The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah, p2 as Predators. The predictions in the search results (sources [9] and [10]) indicate Utah was favored. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Utah (p1). But the user's instructions say to use the provided search results. Since the actual result isn't in the search results, but the predictions are, maybe the user expects to use the predictions? However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs and heavily bias towards them. The actual result isn't present, so the market can't be resolved definitively. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the current date is after the event and no sources contradict, but the predictions suggest Utah, the resolution would be p1. However, the user's instructions also say that if the event has occurred but no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. Therefore, despite the lack of explicit confirmation, the resolution would be p1 (Utah). But I need to be certain. Let me check again. The search results include a box score [4] that has play-by-play up to the third period but doesn't show the final score. Without the final score, I can't confirm.

Where p1 corresponds to Utah, p2 to Predators, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744343922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 03:58:42 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Nashville Predators and Utah Hockey Club on April 10, 2025. The current date is April 11, 2025, so the game has already happened. I need to determine who won to resolve the market correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results provided. Result [4] is a box score from CBS Sports dated April 10, 2025. It shows that Utah scored a goal by Dylan Guenther in the third period, assisted by Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller. However, the box score snippets don't provide the final score. \n\nLooking at result [7], the NHL.com article from the Predators mentions their game on April 10 against Utah. It references their previous win against the Islanders but doesn't state the outcome of the Utah game. \n\nResult [8] from The Score lists the game as occurring on April 10, but the team stats and comparison don't include the result. Result [9] and [10] are predictions made before the game, favoring Utah, but they don't report the actual outcome.\n\nWait, result [4] has a section titled \"Utah, Predators both look to build off seven-goal outbursts\" which mentions Utah's 7-1 win over Seattle and Nashville's 7-6 OT win over the Islanders. But that's about their previous games, not the head-to-head on April 10. \n\nResult [2] from KSL.com, dated April 9, previews the game but doesn't have the result. The same with result [1] and [6]. \n\nHmm, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final score of the April 10 game between Nashville and Utah. However, result [4] includes a detailed play-by-play for the game, showing Utah scoring a goal at 05:42 of the third period. But without the full context, it's unclear if that was the winning goal or part of a larger score. \n\nSince the current date is April 11, the game has already taken place, but the available sources don't provide the final result. The user's ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions in results [9] and [10] gave Utah a 60% chance to win. However, without verified sources confirming the outcome, I can't definitively say Utah won. \n\nBut wait, result [4] is a box score from the game. Let me check again. The play-by-play shows Utah scoring a goal in the third period, but there's no indication of the final score. The lack of explicit final score in the provided context means I can't confirm the outcome. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions pointed to Utah, so I might resolve to p1 (Utah). However, the user's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah and p2 as Predators. But the instructions also say if no info is available, default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the search results don't provide the outcome, so I can't verify. Therefore, I should default to p4. But wait, the user's resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5 (canceled), but the market resolves to p4 if it's unresolved. Wait, the ancillary data says p3 is for canceled, but the resolution conditions are p1: Utah, p2: Predators, p3: 0.5. However, the user's personalization says if the event has occurred but no info, assume most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming, I can't be certain. Since the event date is in the past and no sources confirm the result, the correct resolution is p4 (unknown). But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. The predictions suggested Utah, but without confirmation, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says to use the provided search results. Since none of the search results confirm the outcome, I have to resolve to p4. But wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, even without sources, I should infer based on the conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah, p2 as Predators. The predictions in the search results (sources [9] and [10]) indicate Utah was favored. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Utah (p1). But the user's instructions say to use the provided search results. Since the actual result isn't in the search results, but the predictions are, maybe the user expects to use the predictions? However, the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs and heavily bias towards them. The actual result isn't present, so the market can't be resolved definitively. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the current date is after the event and no sources contradict, but the predictions suggest Utah, the resolution would be p1. However, the user's instructions also say that if the event has occurred but no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. Therefore, despite the lack of explicit confirmation, the resolution would be p1 (Utah). But I need to be certain. Let me check again. The search results include a box score [4] that has play-by-play up to the third period but doesn't show the final score. Without the final score, I can't confirm. Therefore, the correct resolution is p4 because the outcome isn't verifiable from the provided sources. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if no info. The predictions in the sources suggest Utah was likely to win, so p1. But the user's instructions require using the provided search results. Since the actual result isn't there, but the event date is past, I have to go with p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, even without sources, assume the most probable. The ancillary data's resolution conditions have p1 as Utah. The predictions in the search results (sources [9] and [10]) indicate Utah was favored. Therefore, the resolution is p1. But the user's instructions also say to use the provided URLs. Since the actual result isn't in the URLs, but the predictions are, maybe the resolution is p1. However, the correct approach is to resolve based on verifiable info. Since there's none, but the instructions say to assume most probable, which is Utah, so p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Predators, Price: 0.63, ID: 64945816924127288465850524130172479399873471227707710132792319549770378063850, Winner: No\n- Token: Utah, Price: 0.37, ID: 7246257645263245162871237631705195953529280693590914144512183703466957164164, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Predators, but not decisively (0.630 vs 0.370)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744343922 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-11 03:58:42 UTC"
