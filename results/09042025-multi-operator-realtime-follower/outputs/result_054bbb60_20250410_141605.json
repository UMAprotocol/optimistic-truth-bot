  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744294462 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 14:14:22 UTC",

The search results provided are from around this date. Let me go through each source to find relevant information.\n\nLooking at result [1], it mentions that Trump suspended duties on US trading partners, including the EU, with a 90-day pause. The EU praised this move. The date here is April 10, so this is within the timeframe. The action is an executive decision, which fits the ancillary data's requirement of federal legislation or executive action.\n\nResult [2] says the EU is considering suspending their countermeasures for 90 days in response to Trump's pause. This supports that Trump did take action to pause tariffs. The date is also April 10.\n\nResult [7] from BBC News confirms the EU is putting retaliatory tariffs on hold after Trump's 90-day pause. The video transcript mentions Trump's pause and the EU's response. This is another confirmation.\n\nResult [9] from TIME states the EU will hold off on retaliation for 90 days because Trump paused his tariffs. The article explicitly mentions the 90-day suspension by Trump, which is within the May 31 deadline.\n\nResult [8] and [10] discuss the initial tariffs but don't mention the pause. However, the key sources [1], [2], [7], and [9] all confirm the pause. The ancillary data specifies that any executive action to pause tariffs counts, which Trump did on April 10. Since this is before May 31, the answer should be Yes (p2). I need to ensure that the tariffs in question are specifically targeting the EU. The sources mention the reciprocal tariffs on the EU were paused, which aligns with the resolution conditions. The 10% baseline remains, but the additional tariffs were paused, so that qualifies as a reduction or pause specifically for the EU.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
