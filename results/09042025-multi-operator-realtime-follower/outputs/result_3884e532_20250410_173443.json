Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744298845 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 15:27:25 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Athletics and the San Diego Padres scheduled for April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET. The current date provided is April 10, 2025, so the game should have already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. Since the event date (April 9) is in the past relative to the current timestamp (April 10), I should look for verified results. The ancillary data specifies that if the Athletics win, it's p2; if the Padres win, p1. If postponed, the market stays open, but if canceled, it resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nI don't have any user-provided URLs here, so I have to rely on existing knowledge. From my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, I can't access real-time data beyond that. However, the user's current date is April 2025, so I need to simulate checking recent results. Assuming the game took place as scheduled, I need to find out who won. \n\nWait, but since I don't have actual access to future data, how should I proceed? The instructions say if the event is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Padres are generally a stronger team compared to the Athletics, but that's speculative. However, the user's resolution conditions might have specific logic. Wait, looking back: the resolution conditions say p1 is Padres, p2 is Athletics. If no info is available, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the default would be p4. But the instructions mention if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions unless contradicted. However, without any data, it's unclear. But the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info is given, maybe it's a test where the answer is p1 or p2. Alternatively, perhaps the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open (so p4?), but if canceled, resolves to p3. However, the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to canceled. But the current date is April 10, the next day. If the game was postponed to a later date but hasn't been played yet, then the market is still open, so p4. If it was canceled, then p3. But without any information, how to decide? The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't provide a default. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the Padres won, but that's an assumption. However, the correct approach here is that since there's no verifiable information provided, and the event date is in the past, but the user hasn't given any sources, we have to default to p4 (cannot resolve) unless we can infer. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's ancillary data. Wait, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Padres, p2: Athletics. If we have to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps the Padres are more likely to win, so p1. But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the game was postponed. Since the current date is the next day, maybe the game was postponed due to weather or other reasons, and thus the market remains open, leading to p4. But without any info, it's unclear. The user's instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But how do we determine that? The problem is that without any data, we can't know. So in this case, since there's no information provided, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve) because we can't verify the actual result. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So the \"conditions provided in the user prompt\" here are the resolution_conditions, which map p1 to Padres, p2 to Athletics. But how do we determine the most probable outcome? The user prompt doesn't provide any data on team strength or probabilities. Therefore, without any information, we can't assume a probable outcome. Hence, the correct answer would be p4. But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If postponed, remain open (p4). If played, resolve based on the winner. Since the event date has passed, but no info, perhaps the game was postponed, leading to p4. Alternatively, if it's canceled, p3. But without info, we can't know. The instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't give a default. Therefore, the safest answer is p4 because we can't verify the outcome. However, the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info, it's p4. Alternatively, if the game was played and the result is unknown, but the market requires a resolution, maybe p3. But according to the resolution_conditions, p3 is 0.5 (canceled). So unless there's info that it was canceled, we can't assume that. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe MLB game between the Athletics and San Diego Padres was scheduled for **April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET**. The current timestamp is **April 10, 2025, 3:27:25 UTC**, meaning the event date has passed.

The current date provided is April 10, 2025, so the game should have already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. Since the event date (April 9) is in the past relative to the current timestamp (April 10), I should look for verified results. The ancillary data specifies that if the Athletics win, it's p2; if the Padres win, p1. If postponed, the market stays open, but if canceled, it resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nI don't have any user-provided URLs here, so I have to rely on existing knowledge. From my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, I can't access real-time data beyond that. However, the user's current date is April 2025, so I need to simulate checking recent results. Assuming the game took place as scheduled, I need to find out who won. \n\nWait, but since I don't have actual access to future data, how should I proceed? The instructions say if the event is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Padres are generally a stronger team compared to the Athletics, but that's speculative. However, the user's resolution conditions might have specific logic. Wait, looking back: the resolution conditions say p1 is Padres, p2 is Athletics. If no info is available, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the default would be p4. But the instructions mention if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions unless contradicted. However, without any data, it's unclear. But the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info is given, maybe it's a test where the answer is p1 or p2. Alternatively, perhaps the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open (so p4?), but if canceled, resolves to p3. However, the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to canceled. But the current date is April 10, the next day. If the game was postponed to a later date but hasn't been played yet, then the market is still open, so p4. If it was canceled, then p3. But without any information, how to decide? The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't provide a default. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the Padres won, but that's an assumption. However, the correct approach here is that since there's no verifiable information provided, and the event date is in the past, but the user hasn't given any sources, we have to default to p4 (cannot resolve) unless we can infer. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's ancillary data. Wait, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Padres, p2: Athletics. If we have to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps the Padres are more likely to win, so p1. But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the game was postponed. Since the current date is the next day, maybe the game was postponed due to weather or other reasons, and thus the market remains open, leading to p4. But without any info, it's unclear. The user's instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But how do we determine that? The problem is that without any data, we can't know. So in this case, since there's no information provided, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve) because we can't verify the actual result. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So the \"conditions provided in the user prompt\" here are the resolution_conditions, which map p1 to Padres, p2 to Athletics. But how do we determine the most probable outcome? The user prompt doesn't provide any data on team strength or probabilities. Therefore, without any information, we can't assume a probable outcome. Hence, the correct answer would be p4. But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If postponed, remain open (p4). If played, resolve based on the winner. Since the event date has passed, but no info, perhaps the game was postponed, leading to p4. Alternatively, if it's canceled, p3. But without info, we can't know. The instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't give a default. Therefore, the safest answer is p4 because we can't verify the outcome. However, the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info, it's p4. Alternatively, if the game was played and the result is unknown, but the market requires a resolution, maybe p3. But according to the resolution_conditions, p3 is 0.5 (canceled). So unless there's info that it was canceled, we can't assume that. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe MLB game between the Athletics and San Diego Padres was scheduled for **April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET**. The current timestamp is **April 10, 2025, 3:27:25 UTC**, meaning the event date has passed. However, no verifiable sources or outcome details (e.g., score, postponement, or cancellation) are provided in the query or ancillary data. \n\nPer the resolution rules:\n- If the game occurred and the Padres won, resolve to **p1**.\n- If the Athletics won, resolve to **p2**.\n- If canceled, resolve to **p3** (50-50).\n- If postponed or unresolved due to insufficient data, default to **p4**.\n\nWithout explicit confirmation of the outcome, cancellation, or postponement, the resolution cannot be definitively determined. The absence of verified information necessitates a **p4** recommendation until conclusive evidence emerges.\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Athletics, Price: 0.16, ID: 36902301163199596727011097861933231899615075783358139563609977767487707567644, Winner: No\n- Token: San Diego Padres, Price: 0.84, ID: 28071405445057486524471345522292736062332465577417397330786993595165755445655, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors San Diego Padres outcome (0.840 = 84.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Where p1 corresponds to San Diego Padres, p2 to Athletics, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744298845 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 15:27:25 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

The market data should have been considered more heavily in the final recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Athletics and the San Diego Padres scheduled for April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET. The current date provided is April 10, 2025, so the game should have already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. Since the event date (April 9) is in the past relative to the current timestamp (April 10), I should look for verified results. The ancillary data specifies that if the Athletics win, it's p2; if the Padres win, p1. If postponed, the market stays open, but if canceled, it resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nI don't have any user-provided URLs here, so I have to rely on existing knowledge. From my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, I can't access real-time data beyond that. However, the user's current date is April 2025, so I need to simulate checking recent results. Assuming the game took place as scheduled, I need to find out who won. \n\nWait, but since I don't have actual access to future data, how should I proceed? The instructions say if the event is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Padres are generally a stronger team compared to the Athletics, but that's speculative. However, the user's resolution conditions might have specific logic. Wait, looking back: the resolution conditions say p1 is Padres, p2 is Athletics. If no info is available, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the default would be p4. But the instructions mention if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions unless contradicted. However, without any data, it's unclear. But the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info is given, maybe it's a test where the answer is p1 or p2. Alternatively, perhaps the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open (so p4?), but if canceled, resolves to p3. However, the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to canceled. But the current date is April 10, the next day. If the game was postponed to a later date but hasn't been played yet, then the market is still open, so p4. If it was canceled, then p3. But without any information, how to decide? The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't provide a default. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the Padres won, but that's an assumption. However, the correct approach here is that since there's no verifiable information provided, and the event date is in the past, but the user hasn't given any sources, we have to default to p4 (cannot resolve) unless we can infer. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's ancillary data. Wait, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Padres, p2: Athletics. If we have to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps the Padres are more likely to win, so p1. But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the game was postponed. Since the current date is the next day, maybe the game was postponed due to weather or other reasons, and thus the market remains open, leading to p4. But without any info, it's unclear. The user's instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But how do we determine that? The problem is that without any data, we can't know. So in this case, since there's no information provided, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve) because we can't verify the actual result. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So the \"conditions provided in the user prompt\" here are the resolution_conditions, which map p1 to Padres, p2 to Athletics. But how do we determine the most probable outcome? The user prompt doesn't provide any data on team strength or probabilities. Therefore, without any information, we can't assume a probable outcome. Hence, the correct answer would be p4. But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If postponed, remain open (p4). If played, resolve based on the winner. Since the event date has passed, but no info, perhaps the game was postponed, leading to p4. Alternatively, if it's canceled, p3. But without info, we can't know. The instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't give a default. Therefore, the safest answer is p4 because we can't verify the outcome. However, the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info, it's p4. Alternatively, if the game was played and the result is unknown, but the market requires a resolution, maybe p3. But according to the resolution_conditions, p3 is 0.5 (canceled). So unless there's info that it was canceled, we can't assume that. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe MLB game between the Athletics and San Diego Padres was scheduled for **April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET**. The current timestamp is **April 10, 2025, 3:27:25 UTC**, meaning the event date has passed. However, no verifiable sources or outcome details (e.g., score, postponement, or cancellation) are provided in the query or ancillary data. \n\nPer the resolution rules:\n- If the game occurred and the Padres won, resolve to **p1**.\n- If the Athletics won, resolve to **p2**.\n- If canceled, resolve to **p3** (50-50).\n- If postponed or unresolved due to insufficient data, default to **p4**.\n\nWithout explicit confirmation of the outcome, cancellation, or postponement, the resolution cannot be definitively determined. The absence of verified information necessitates a **p4** recommendation until conclusive evidence emerges.\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\n========================================\n\n===== SOLVER: PERPLEXITY =====\nRECOMMENDATION: p1\nMARKET ALIGNMENT: The market data shows a moderate preference for the San Diego Padres with a confidence level of 84%. This aligns with the solver's recommendation of p1 for the San Diego Padres as the winners. The market sentiment does not strongly contradict the solver's recommendation, as it does not exceed the 85% threshold for a strong market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Athletics vs. Padres game on April 9, 2025. The key here is to determine who won that game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 10, 2025, so the game in question (April 9) has already happened. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. Now, I need to look through the search results to find the outcome of that specific game.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources that mention games between the Padres and Athletics around this date. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nSearch result [9] from ESPN provides a recap of the game on April 9, 2025. The title says \"Padres 2-1 Athletics (Apr 9, 2025) Game Recap - ESPN\" and the summary mentions that the Padres won 2-1. The detailed recap confirms that Randy V\u00e1squez pitched well for the Padres, and they secured the victory despite missing some key players. This seems like a solid source.\n\nSearch result [14] from MLB.com also states that the Padres beat the Athletics 2-1 on April 9, becoming the first team to reach 10 wins. This corroborates the ESPN report.\n\nSearch result [19] is a YouTube video titled \"Padres vs. A's Game Highlights (4/9/25)\" which likely shows the Padres winning, but since it's a video, the text snippet doesn't provide the score. However, the other sources already confirm the result.\n\nAdditionally, search result [12] from Fox Sports has a box score for the April 9 game, showing the Padres with 2 runs and the Athletics with 1. The box score details list the Padres as the winning team.\n\nThere's also search result [16] which is a prediction article, but it mentions that in their last meeting on April 9, the Athletics won 10-4. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check that again. Oh, no, looking closer, that prediction article from April 9 mentions the previous day's game (April 8) where the Athletics won 10-4. The April 9 game is the one we're interested in, and the other sources clearly state the Padres won 2-1 on April 9.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the Padres won the game on April 9, 2025, with a score of 2-1. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"San Diego Padres,\" which corresponds to p1 according to the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n========================================\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Athletics, Price: 0.16, ID: 36902301163199596727011097861933231899615075783358139563609977767487707567644, Winner: No\n- Token: San Diego Padres, Price: 0.84, ID: 28071405445057486524471345522292736062332465577417397330786993595165755445655, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors San Diego Padres outcome (0.840 = 84.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Since the current date is the next day, maybe the game was postponed due to weather or other reasons, and thus the market remains open, leading to p4. But without any info, it's unclear. The user's instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But how do we determine that? The problem is that without any data, we can't know. So in this case, since there's no information provided, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve) because we can't verify the actual result. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So the \"conditions provided in the user prompt\" here are the resolution_conditions, which map p1 to Padres, p2 to Athletics. But how do we determine the most probable outcome? The user prompt doesn't provide any data on team strength or probabilities. Therefore, without any information, we can't assume a probable outcome. Hence, the correct answer would be p4. But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If postponed, remain open (p4). If played, resolve based on the winner. Since the event date has passed, but no info, perhaps the game was postponed, leading to p4. Alternatively, if it's canceled, p3. But without info, we can't know. The instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't give a default. Therefore, the safest answer is p4 because we can't verify the outcome. However, the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info, it's p4. Alternatively, if the game was played and the result is unknown, but the market requires a resolution, maybe p3. But according to the resolution_conditions, p3 is 0.5 (canceled). So unless there's info that it was canceled, we can't assume that. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe MLB game between the Athletics and San Diego Padres was scheduled for **April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET**. The current timestamp is **April 10, 2025, 3:27:25 UTC**, meaning the event date has passed. However, no verifiable sources or outcome details (e.g., score, postponement, or cancellation) are provided in the query or ancillary data. \n\nPer the resolution rules:\n- If the game occurred and the Padres won, resolve to **p1**.\n- If the Athletics won, resolve to **p2**.\n- If canceled, resolve to **p3** (50-50).\n- If postponed or unresolved due to insufficient data, default to **p4**.\n\nWithout explicit confirmation of the outcome, cancellation, or postponement, the resolution cannot be definitively determined. The absence of verified information necessitates a **p4** recommendation until conclusive evidence emerges.\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\n========================================\n\n===== SOLVER: PERPLEXITY =====\nRECOMMENDATION: p1\nMARKET ALIGNMENT: The market data shows a moderate preference for the San Diego Padres with a confidence level of 84%. This aligns with the solver's recommendation of p1 for the San Diego Padres as the winners. The market sentiment does not strongly contradict the solver's recommendation, as it does not exceed the 85% threshold for a strong market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Athletics vs. Padres game on April 9, 2025. The key here is to determine who won that game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 10, 2025, so the game in question (April 9) has already happened. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. Now, I need to look through the search results to find the outcome of that specific game.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources that mention games between the Padres and Athletics around this date. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nSearch result [9] from ESPN provides a recap of the game on April 9, 2025. The title says \"Padres 2-1 Athletics (Apr 9, 2025) Game Recap - ESPN\" and the summary mentions that the Padres won 2-1. The detailed recap confirms that Randy V\u00e1squez pitched well for the Padres, and they secured the victory despite missing some key players. This seems like a solid source.\n\nSearch result [14] from MLB.com also states that the Padres beat the Athletics 2-1 on April 9, becoming the first team to reach 10 wins. This corroborates the ESPN report.\n\nSearch result [19] is a YouTube video titled \"Padres vs. A's Game Highlights (4/9/25)\" which likely shows the Padres winning, but since it's a video, the text snippet doesn't provide the score. However, the other sources already confirm the result.\n\nAdditionally, search result [12] from Fox Sports has a box score for the April 9 game, showing the Padres with 2 runs and the Athletics with 1. The box score details list the Padres as the winning team.\n\nThere's also search result [16] which is a prediction article, but it mentions that in their last meeting on April 9, the Athletics won 10-4. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check that again. Oh, no, looking closer, that prediction article from April 9 mentions the previous day's game (April 8) where the Athletics won 10-4. The April 9 game is the one we're interested in, and the other sources clearly state the Padres won 2-1 on April 9.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the Padres won the game on April 9, 2025, with a score of 2-1. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"San Diego Padres,\" which corresponds to p1 according to the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n========================================\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Athletics, Price: 0.16, ID: 36902301163199596727011097861933231899615075783358139563609977767487707567644, Winner: No\n- Token: San Diego Padres, Price: 0.84, ID: 28071405445057486524471345522292736062332465577417397330786993595165755445655, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors San Diego Padres outcome (0.840 = 84.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Athletics and the San Diego Padres scheduled for April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET. The current date provided is April 10, 2025, so the game should have already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. Since the event date (April 9) is in the past relative to the current timestamp (April 10), I should look for verified results. The ancillary data specifies that if the Athletics win, it's p2; if the Padres win, p1. If postponed, the market stays open, but if canceled, it resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nI don't have any user-provided URLs here, so I have to rely on existing knowledge. From my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, I can't access real-time data beyond that. However, the user's current date is April 2025, so I need to simulate checking recent results. Assuming the game took place as scheduled, I need to find out who won. \n\nWait, but since I don't have actual access to future data, how should I proceed? The instructions say if the event is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Padres are generally a stronger team compared to the Athletics, but that's speculative. However, the user's resolution conditions might have specific logic. Wait, looking back: the resolution conditions say p1 is Padres, p2 is Athletics. If no info is available, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the default would be p4. But the instructions mention if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions unless contradicted. However, without any data, it's unclear. But the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info is given, maybe it's a test where the answer is p1 or p2. Alternatively, perhaps the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open (so p4?), but if canceled, resolves to p3. However, the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to canceled. But the current date is April 10, the next day. If the game was postponed to a later date but hasn't been played yet, then the market is still open, so p4. If it was canceled, then p3. But without any information, how to decide? The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't provide a default. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the Padres won, but that's an assumption. However, the correct approach here is that since there's no verifiable information provided, and the event date is in the past, but the user hasn't given any sources, we have to default to p4 (cannot resolve) unless we can infer. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's ancillary data. Wait, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Padres, p2: Athletics. If we have to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps the Padres are more likely to win, so p1. But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the game was postponed. Since the current date is the next day, maybe the game was postponed due to weather or other reasons, and thus the market remains open, leading to p4. But without any info, it's unclear. The user's instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But how do we determine that? The problem is that without any data, we can't know. So in this case, since there's no information provided, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve) because we can't verify the actual result. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So the \"conditions provided in the user prompt\" here are the resolution_conditions, which map p1 to Padres, p2 to Athletics. But how do we determine the most probable outcome? The user prompt doesn't provide any data on team strength or probabilities. Therefore, without any information, we can't assume a probable outcome. Hence, the correct answer would be p4. But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If postponed, remain open (p4). If played, resolve based on the winner. Since the event date has passed, but no info, perhaps the game was postponed, leading to p4. Alternatively, if it's canceled, p3. But without info, we can't know. The instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't give a default. Therefore, the safest answer is p4 because we can't verify the outcome. However, the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info, it's p4. Alternatively, if the game was played and the result is unknown, but the market requires a resolution, maybe p3. But according to the resolution_conditions, p3 is 0.5 (canceled). So unless there's info that it was canceled, we can't assume that. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe MLB game between the Athletics and San Diego Padres was scheduled for **April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET**.

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Athletics vs. Padres game on April 9, 2025. The key here is to determine who won that game using the provided search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is April 10, 2025, so the game in question (April 9) has already happened. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. Now, I need to look through the search results to find the outcome of that specific game.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources that mention games between the Padres and Athletics around this date. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nSearch result [9] from ESPN provides a recap of the game on April 9, 2025. The title says \"Padres 2-1 Athletics (Apr 9, 2025) Game Recap - ESPN\" and the summary mentions that the Padres won 2-1. The detailed recap confirms that Randy V\u00e1squez pitched well for the Padres, and they secured the victory despite missing some key players. This seems like a solid source.\n\nSearch result [14] from MLB.com also states that the Padres beat the Athletics 2-1 on April 9, becoming the first team to reach 10 wins. This corroborates the ESPN report.\n\nSearch result [19] is a YouTube video titled \"Padres vs. A's Game Highlights (4/9/25)\" which likely shows the Padres winning, but since it's a video, the text snippet doesn't provide the score. However, the other sources already confirm the result.\n\nAdditionally, search result [12] from Fox Sports has a box score for the April 9 game, showing the Padres with 2 runs and the Athletics with 1. The box score details list the Padres as the winning team.\n\nThere's also search result [16] which is a prediction article, but it mentions that in their last meeting on April 9, the Athletics won 10-4. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check that again. Oh, no, looking closer, that prediction article from April 9 mentions the previous day's game (April 8) where the Athletics won 10-4. The April 9 game is the one we're interested in, and the other sources clearly state the Padres won 2-1 on April 9.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the Padres won the game on April 9, 2025, with a score of 2-1.

Where p1 corresponds to San Diego Padres, p2 to Athletics, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744298845 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 15:27:25 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\ndef fetch_mlb_game_result():\n    load_dotenv()\n    api_key = os.getenv('SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY')\n    url = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-04-09\"\n    headers = {\n        'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': api_key\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    games = response.json()\n\n    for game in games:\n        if game['HomeTeam'] == 'OAK' and game['AwayTeam'] == 'SD':\n            if game['Status'] == 'Final':\n                if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n                    return \"recommendation: p2\"  # Athletics win\n                elif game['HomeTeamRuns'] < game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n                    return \"recommendation: p1\"  # San Diego Padres win\n            elif game['Status'] == 'Postponed':\n                return \"recommendation: p4\"  # Game postponed, too early to resolve\n            elif game['Status'] == 'Canceled':\n                return \"recommendation: p3\"  # Game canceled, resolve 50-50\n    return \"recommendation: p4\"  # No data or game not found\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(fetch_mlb_game_result())\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Athletics vs. San Diego Padres, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for April 9 at 3:35PM ET:\nIf the Athletics win, the market will resolve to \"Athletics\".\nIf the San Diego Padres win, the market will resolve to \"San Diego Padres\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to San Diego Padres, p2 to Athletics, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744298845 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 15:27:25 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport logging\n\n# Load API key from .env file\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Check if API key is available\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\n        \"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY not found in environment variables. \"\n        \"Please add it to your .env file.\"\n    )\n\n# Constants - RESOLUTION MAPPING\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Athletics\": \"p2\",  # Athletics win maps to p2\n    \"San Diego Padres\": \"p1\",  # San Diego Padres win maps to p1\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",  # Canceled or no make-up game maps to p3\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",  # Incomplete data maps to p4\n}\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\ndef fetch_game_data(date, home_team, away_team):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches game data for the specified date and teams.\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching game data for {away_team} @ {home_team} on {date}\")\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}?key={API_KEY}\"\n    logger.debug(f\"Using API endpoint: {url}\")\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        games = response.json()\n\n        for game in games:\n            if game[\"HomeTeam\"] == home_team and game[\"AwayTeam\"] == away_team:\n                return game\n        return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef determine_resolution(game):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the resolution based on the game's status and outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not game:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n    status = game.get(\"Status\")\n    if status == \"Final\":\n        home_score = game.get(\"HomeTeamRuns\")\n        away_score = game.get(\"AwayTeamRuns\")\n        if home_score > away_score:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Athletics\"]\n        else:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"San Diego Padres\"]\n    elif status == \"Canceled\":\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    elif status == \"Postponed\":\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    else:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\ndef main():\n    date = \"2025-04-09\"\n    home_team = \"OAK\"  # Athletics abbreviation\n    away_team = \"SD\"   # San Diego Padres abbreviation\n\n    game = fetch_game_data(date, home_team, away_team)\n    resolution = determine_resolution(game)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {resolution}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

Where p1 corresponds to San Diego Padres, p2 to Athletics, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744298845 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 15:27:25 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Athletics and the San Diego Padres scheduled for April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET. The current date provided is April 10, 2025, so the game should have already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. Since the event date (April 9) is in the past relative to the current timestamp (April 10), I should look for verified results. The ancillary data specifies that if the Athletics win, it's p2; if the Padres win, p1. If postponed, the market stays open, but if canceled, it resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nI don't have any user-provided URLs here, so I have to rely on existing knowledge. From my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, I can't access real-time data beyond that. However, the user's current date is April 2025, so I need to simulate checking recent results. Assuming the game took place as scheduled, I need to find out who won. \n\nWait, but since I don't have actual access to future data, how should I proceed? The instructions say if the event is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Padres are generally a stronger team compared to the Athletics, but that's speculative. However, the user's resolution conditions might have specific logic. Wait, looking back: the resolution conditions say p1 is Padres, p2 is Athletics. If no info is available, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the default would be p4. But the instructions mention if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions unless contradicted. However, without any data, it's unclear. But the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info is given, maybe it's a test where the answer is p1 or p2. Alternatively, perhaps the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open (so p4?), but if canceled, resolves to p3. However, the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to canceled. But the current date is April 10, the next day. If the game was postponed to a later date but hasn't been played yet, then the market is still open, so p4. If it was canceled, then p3. But without any information, how to decide? The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't provide a default. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the Padres won, but that's an assumption. However, the correct approach here is that since there's no verifiable information provided, and the event date is in the past, but the user hasn't given any sources, we have to default to p4 (cannot resolve) unless we can infer. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's ancillary data. Wait, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Padres, p2: Athletics. If we have to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps the Padres are more likely to win, so p1. But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the game was postponed. Since the current date is the next day, maybe the game was postponed due to weather or other reasons, and thus the market remains open, leading to p4. But without any info, it's unclear. The user's instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But how do we determine that? The problem is that without any data, we can't know. So in this case, since there's no information provided, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve) because we can't verify the actual result. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So the \"conditions provided in the user prompt\" here are the resolution_conditions, which map p1 to Padres, p2 to Athletics. But how do we determine the most probable outcome? The user prompt doesn't provide any data on team strength or probabilities. Therefore, without any information, we can't assume a probable outcome. Hence, the correct answer would be p4. But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If postponed, remain open (p4). If played, resolve based on the winner. Since the event date has passed, but no info, perhaps the game was postponed, leading to p4. Alternatively, if it's canceled, p3. But without info, we can't know. The instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't give a default. Therefore, the safest answer is p4 because we can't verify the outcome. However, the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info, it's p4. Alternatively, if the game was played and the result is unknown, but the market requires a resolution, maybe p3. But according to the resolution_conditions, p3 is 0.5 (canceled). So unless there's info that it was canceled, we can't assume that. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe MLB game between the Athletics and San Diego Padres was scheduled for **April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET**.

The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Athletics and the San Diego Padres scheduled for April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET. The current date provided is April 10, 2025, so the game should have already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. Since the event date (April 9) is in the past relative to the current timestamp (April 10), I should look for verified results. The ancillary data specifies that if the Athletics win, it's p2; if the Padres win, p1. If postponed, the market stays open, but if canceled, it resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nI don't have any user-provided URLs here, so I have to rely on existing knowledge. From my knowledge cutoff in July 2024, I can't access real-time data beyond that. However, the user's current date is April 2025, so I need to simulate checking recent results. Assuming the game took place as scheduled, I need to find out who won. \n\nWait, but since I don't have actual access to future data, how should I proceed? The instructions say if the event is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Padres are generally a stronger team compared to the Athletics, but that's speculative. However, the user's resolution conditions might have specific logic. Wait, looking back: the resolution conditions say p1 is Padres, p2 is Athletics. If no info is available, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the default would be p4. But the instructions mention if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions unless contradicted. However, without any data, it's unclear. But the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info is given, maybe it's a test where the answer is p1 or p2. Alternatively, perhaps the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open (so p4?), but if canceled, resolves to p3. However, the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, which corresponds to canceled. But the current date is April 10, the next day. If the game was postponed to a later date but hasn't been played yet, then the market is still open, so p4. If it was canceled, then p3. But without any information, how to decide? The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't provide a default. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the Padres won, but that's an assumption. However, the correct approach here is that since there's no verifiable information provided, and the event date is in the past, but the user hasn't given any sources, we have to default to p4 (cannot resolve) unless we can infer. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's ancillary data. Wait, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Padres, p2: Athletics. If we have to assume the most probable outcome, perhaps the Padres are more likely to win, so p1. But that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the game was postponed. Since the current date is the next day, maybe the game was postponed due to weather or other reasons, and thus the market remains open, leading to p4. But without any info, it's unclear. The user's instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But how do we determine that? The problem is that without any data, we can't know. So in this case, since there's no information provided, and the event date has passed, but no sources confirm the outcome, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve) because we can't verify the actual result. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So the \"conditions provided in the user prompt\" here are the resolution_conditions, which map p1 to Padres, p2 to Athletics. But how do we determine the most probable outcome? The user prompt doesn't provide any data on team strength or probabilities. Therefore, without any information, we can't assume a probable outcome. Hence, the correct answer would be p4. But wait, the ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. If postponed, remain open (p4). If played, resolve based on the winner. Since the event date has passed, but no info, perhaps the game was postponed, leading to p4. Alternatively, if it's canceled, p3. But without info, we can't know. The instruction says if no info on outcome, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But the conditions don't give a default. Therefore, the safest answer is p4 because we can't verify the outcome. However, the user might expect that since the date has passed and no info, it's p4. Alternatively, if the game was played and the result is unknown, but the market requires a resolution, maybe p3. But according to the resolution_conditions, p3 is 0.5 (canceled). So unless there's info that it was canceled, we can't assume that. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe MLB game between the Athletics and San Diego Padres was scheduled for **April 9, 2025, at 3:35 PM ET**. The current timestamp is **April 10, 2025, 3:27:25 UTC**, meaning the event date has passed. However, no verifiable sources or outcome details (e.g., score, postponement, or cancellation) are provided in the query or ancillary data. \n\nPer the resolution rules:\n- If the game occurred and the Padres won, resolve to **p1**.\n- If the Athletics won, resolve to **p2**.\n- If canceled, resolve to **p3** (50-50).\n- If postponed or unresolved due to insufficient data, default to **p4**.\n\nWithout explicit confirmation of the outcome, cancellation, or postponement, the resolution cannot be definitively determined. The absence of verified information necessitates a **p4** recommendation until conclusive evidence emerges.\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Athletics, Price: 0.16, ID: 36902301163199596727011097861933231899615075783358139563609977767487707567644, Winner: No\n- Token: San Diego Padres, Price: 0.84, ID: 28071405445057486524471345522292736062332465577417397330786993595165755445655, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors San Diego Padres outcome (0.840 = 84.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3.

This corroborates the ESPN report.\n\nSearch result [19] is a YouTube video titled \"Padres vs. A's Game Highlights (4/9/25)\" which likely shows the Padres winning, but since it's a video, the text snippet doesn't provide the score. However, the other sources already confirm the result.\n\nAdditionally, search result [12] from Fox Sports has a box score for the April 9 game, showing the Padres with 2 runs and the Athletics with 1. The box score details list the Padres as the winning team.\n\nThere's also search result [16] which is a prediction article, but it mentions that in their last meeting on April 9, the Athletics won 10-4. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check that again. Oh, no, looking closer, that prediction article from April 9 mentions the previous day's game (April 8) where the Athletics won 10-4. The April 9 game is the one we're interested in, and the other sources clearly state the Padres won 2-1 on April 9.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the Padres won the game on April 9, 2025, with a score of 2-1.

Therefore, the market should resolve to \"San Diego Padres,\" which corresponds to p1 according to the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Athletics, Price: 0.16, ID: 36902301163199596727011097861933231899615075783358139563609977767487707567644, Winner: No\n- Token: San Diego Padres, Price: 0.84, ID: 28071405445057486524471345522292736062332465577417397330786993595165755445655, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors San Diego Padres outcome (0.840 = 84.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n"

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744298845 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 15:27:25 UTC"
