  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744297133 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 14:58:53 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carlsen vs. Abdusattorov quarterfinal match in the Paris Freestyle Chess Grand Slam. The current date is April 10, 2025, and the event's quarterfinals are happening now. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The search results mention that the quarterfinals started on April 9th and 10th. From result [15], it's noted that Carlsen won the first game against Abdusattorov on April 9th. Then, result [3] states that Abdusattorov must win the next day to force a tiebreak. Since the current date is April 10th, the second game would have just concluded.\n\nLooking at result [15], Carlsen secured a win in the first classical game. If Abdusattorov didn't win the second game, Carlsen would advance. However, if Abdusattorov won the second game, they'd go into tiebreaks. But the latest info from the search results (up to April 10th) doesn't mention the second game's result yet. However, since the user's timestamp is April 10th afternoon UTC, and the event is in Paris, the second game might have just finished. \n\nWait, result [7] is a YouTube video from April 10th titled \"Carlsen vs Abdusattorov | Paris Freestyle 2025\" which shows the first game. The description mentions the quarterfinals being best of two classical games. Since Carlsen already won the first game, if the second game was a draw or a Carlsen win, he advances. If Abdusattorov won the second, they go to tiebreaks. But the search results don't provide the second game's outcome yet. However, result [15] from ChessBase on April 10th says Carlsen has the only win of the day (April 9th), and Abdusattorov needs to win on the 10th. Since the current time is April 10th afternoon, the second game might have concluded, but there's no updated result in the provided search results. \n\nGiven that the user's current timestamp is April 10th, 3 PM UTC, and the event is in Paris (UTC+2), the second game would have been played earlier that day. Without explicit info on the second game's result, but knowing that Carlsen only needs a draw in the second game to advance, and given his strong position, it's likely he advanced. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on verified facts. Since the search results don't explicitly state the second game's outcome, but the first game was a Carlsen win, and the second game's result isn't confirmed, we might have to assume the event is still ongoing. Wait, but the user's timestamp is April 10th, 3 PM UTC. The second game would have been played on April 10th. If the event is scheduled for April 9th and 10th, and the current time is April 10th afternoon, the second game has already taken place. However, the latest search result [15] from April 10th only mentions the first game's result. There's no info on the second game. \n\nIn the absence of explicit information, but knowing that Carlsen won the first game, and the second game's result isn't provided, the market can't be resolved yet. Wait, but the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The event date is April 9th and 10th. Since it's April 10th, the event is ongoing. However, the user's timestamp is April 10th, 3 PM UTC. If the second game was scheduled for the same day but after the current time, it's a future event. But the search results don't specify the exact time. \n\nAlternatively, if the second game was played on April 10th before the current timestamp, but no results are available, we have to check. Since the search results don't include any info beyond the first game, and the user's timestamp is the same day, it's possible the second game hasn't concluded yet. Therefore, the event is still ongoing, and the market should resolve to p4 (unknown). But wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: Abdusattorov, p2: Carlsen, p3: 50-50. The user's ancillary data says if the game is postponed, it remains open; if canceled, 50-50. However, the event is ongoing, and the first game was a Carlsen win. If the second game hasn't been played yet (same day but later time), then it's a future event, so p4. But the user's current time is April 10th, 3 PM UTC. If the second game is scheduled for later that day, it's still future. However, the search results don't specify the exact schedule. \n\nWait, result [4] mentions the knockout stage (9-14 April) with each match over two days, one long game per day. So the quarterfinals are two games, one on April 9th and the second on April 10th. If the current time is April 10th, 3 PM UTC, the second game would have been played on April 10th. If the game has already happened but isn't reported in the search results, we have to go by available info. But since the search results don't include the second game's result, we can't confirm. Therefore, the event is still in progress, and the market can't be resolved yet, leading to p4. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the event date is April 9th and 10th, which is the current date. Therefore, the event is ongoing, and the market should remain open (p4). But the user's resolution conditions don't have a p4; the options are p1, p2, p3. Wait, looking back, the ancillary data says if the game is postponed, the market remains open (so p4?), but the resolution conditions are p1: Abdusattorov, p2: Carlsen, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the resolution_conditions in the query have p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50). So if the event is still ongoing (future), recommend p4. If it's past and no info, p3. \n\nBut the event dates are April 9th and 10th. The current date is April 10th. If the second game is scheduled for April 10th but hasn't happened yet (current time is 3 PM UTC), then it's a future event, so p4. If the second game has already happened but no result is available, then it's unresolved, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. However, without info, we can't assume. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second game was played, and Carlsen advanced. But the search results don't confirm this. The latest info is from April 10th, which only mentions the first game. Therefore, the second game is yet to be played, making it a future event. Hence, the market should resolve to p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. Wait, the ancillary_data says if the game is postponed, the market remains open (p4), if canceled, p3. But the query's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5. However, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Since the second game is on April 10th, and the current time is April 10th 3 PM UTC, depending on the local time in Paris (UTC+2), it's 5 PM there. If the game was scheduled for the afternoon, it might have concluded. But without explicit info, it's safer to consider that the event is ongoing and the outcome isn't determined yet, hence p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. If the event is in the past but no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the confusion, but based on the search results provided, the first game was won by Carlsen. The second game's result isn't available. If the second game was a draw or a Carlsen win, he advances. If Abdusattorov won, they go to tiebreaks. Since there's no info, but the event date is current, it's still ongoing. Therefore, the market can't be resolved yet, so p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. Wait, looking back, the ancillary_data says if the game is postponed, the market remains open (p4). If canceled, p3. But the event is ongoing, not postponed or canceled. Therefore, the market should remain open (p4). However, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Since part of the event (second game) is on the current date, but the time isn't specified, it's safer to return p4. But the user's query might expect the result based on available info. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second game was played, and Carlsen advanced. But without explicit confirmation, it's risky. However, in the absence of info, and given that the first game was a Carlsen win, and the second game might have been a draw, leading to Carlsen's advancement. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Carlsen advances, so p2. But this is an assumption. The user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event date is current, but part of it is in the past (April 9th), and part is today (April 10th), but the second game's result isn't available, it's safer to return p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. So if the second game is scheduled for later on April 10th, it's future. Therefore, p4. But the search results don't specify the exact time. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's instructions to the letter: if the event is in the future (same day but later time), return p4. Since the current time is 3 PM UTC on April 10th, and the event is in Paris (UTC+2), which is 5 PM local time. If the game was scheduled for the afternoon, it might have already happened. But without explicit info, it's safer to consider that the event is ongoing and the outcome isn't known, hence p4. However, the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. Wait, the ancillary_data says the market resolves to p1, p2, or p3. The resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5. The user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. But the market's resolution options don't include p4. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's query includes resolution_conditions: p1: 0, p2:1, p3:0.5. The personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the market's options are p1, p2, p3. So if the event is in the future, the recommendation is p4, but the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is a conflict. However, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Therefore, despite the resolution_conditions, the correct answer is p4. But the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the resolution_conditions. But given the data, the correct approach is to follow the personalization instructions: if the event is in the future, return p4. Since the second game is on April 10th, and the current time is April 10th 3 PM UTC, if the game is scheduled for later that day, it's future. Therefore, p4. However, the search results don't specify the exact time of the second game. Result [4] says the knockout stage (9-14 April) with each match over two days, one long game per day. So the first game was on April 9th, the second on April 10th. If the current time is April 10th 3 PM UTC, the second game might have already been played (in the morning) or is yet to be played (afternoon). Without explicit info, but given that the search results up to April 10th don't mention the second game's result, it's safer to assume that the event is still ongoing, hence p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If the current time is April 10th 3 PM UTC, the second game might have already been played (in the morning) or is yet to be played (afternoon). Without explicit info, but given that the search results up to April 10th don't mention the second game's result, it's safer to assume that the event is still ongoing, hence p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
