  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744294322 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 14:12:02 UTC",

The resolution depends on any federal legislation or executive action by Trump that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs on Indian imports by May 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 10, 2025. The deadline is May 31, so there's about a month and a half left. The key here is to look at the search results provided to see if any actions have already been taken.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of information about Trump's recent tariff announcements. From result [1], it's mentioned that on April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for 60 countries, including India, but excluded China. This pause started on April 10. The article also states that the 10% baseline tariff remains, but the higher reciprocal tariffs (like the 26% for India) are paused. \n\nResult [8] confirms that the 10% baseline tariff is still in place, but the reciprocal tariffs above that are paused for 90 days. Specifically for India, the 26% reciprocal tariff is paused, but the 10% remains. \n\nResult [6] mentions that India is looking to expedite a trade deal with the US following this pause. The article also notes that the US reciprocal tariff for India remains at 10%, which aligns with the pause on the higher rate. \n\nResult [17] from Wikipedia states that on April 9, Trump paused reciprocal tariffs above 10% for 90 days, except for China. This includes India, so the higher tariffs are paused. \n\nResult [18] in SupplyChainDive also mentions the 90-day pause on most tariffs except China, with the baseline 10% still applicable. \n\nPutting this together, Trump did take executive action by pausing the higher reciprocal tariffs (26% for India) for 90 days starting April 10. This pause would last until July 2025, which is beyond the May 31 deadline. Since the pause is an executive action that delays the higher tariffs, it meets the criteria in the ancillary data. The 10% baseline isn't affected, but the question specifically asks about any tariffs targeting India. The reciprocal tariff was a specific higher rate for India, so pausing that counts as a delay. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2) because Trump's executive action on April 9 paused the higher tariffs on India before the June deadline.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
