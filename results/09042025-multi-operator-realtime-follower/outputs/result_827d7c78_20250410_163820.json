If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

The user wants to know if Trump will reduce or pause tariffs on Laos before June 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The current date is April 10, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events. The original tariffs were announced on April 2, 2025, with a 10% universal tariff starting April 5 and a 48% reciprocal tariff on Laos effective April 9, totaling 58% [1][3]. However, on April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the higher reciprocal tariffs for over 75 countries, reducing them to 10% during this period [2][5][6][9][10][13][14][15]. Laos is mentioned in several sources as being included in this pause [11][12].\n\nThe key points here are whether the pause applies to Laos and if it meets the market's criteria. The user's ancillary data specifies that any federal legislation or executive action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Laos by May 31 counts as Yes (p2). The April 9 announcement is an executive action that pauses the higher reciprocal tariffs (48%) on Laos, reducing them to the baseline 10% for 90 days. Since this action was taken before May 31, it qualifies. The 10% universal tariff remains, but the additional reciprocal tariff specific to Laos is paused, which fits the resolution condition of targeting the listed country.\n\nSome sources, like [11] and [12], mention Laos's inclusion in the pause, though they express concerns about the short negotiation window. However, the market resolution is based on the action taken, not the outcome of negotiations. Therefore, the pause on the reciprocal tariff meets the criteria for p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9005, ID: 101995456375288895726218889238436792930279339149693589541706488007756176329663, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0995, ID: 21210514234412628287666278040991741841796754566082393552942690168447117969394, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.900 = 90.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1.

The user's ancillary data specifies that any federal legislation or executive action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes tariffs specifically targeting Laos by May 31 counts as Yes (p2). The April 9 announcement is an executive action that pauses the higher reciprocal tariffs (48%) on Laos, reducing them to the baseline 10% for 90 days. Since this action was taken before May 31, it qualifies. The 10% universal tariff remains, but the additional reciprocal tariff specific to Laos is paused, which fits the resolution condition of targeting the listed country.\n\nSome sources, like [11] and [12], mention Laos's inclusion in the pause, though they express concerns about the short negotiation window. However, the market resolution is based on the action taken, not the outcome of negotiations. Therefore, the pause on the reciprocal tariff meets the criteria for p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.9005, ID: 101995456375288895726218889238436792930279339149693589541706488007756176329663, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.0995, ID: 21210514234412628287666278040991741841796754566082393552942690168447117969394, Winner: No\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.900 = 90.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nIf the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1.
