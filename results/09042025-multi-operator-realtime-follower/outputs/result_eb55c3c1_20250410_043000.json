  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744259319 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 04:28:39 UTC",

The ancillary data specifies that if the Spurs win, it's p2; if the Warriors win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is April 10, 2025, so the game date (April 9) is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [1] from ESPN shows the final score as Warriors 94, Spurs 104. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check again. The box score in [1] initially lists Warriors 94 and Spurs 104 under \"Game 1\" on 11/23, but then later under \"Game 3\" it's listed as LIVE. Hmm, maybe there's a mix-up. Source [3] (ESPN box score) also mentions Warriors 94 and Spurs 104, but the date is April 9, 2025. However, the detailed stats in [1] and [3] show the game in progress with live updates, which might be confusing. \n\nWait, source [7] (CBS Sports) mentions the Warriors' game against the Spurs on April 9 as part of a back-to-back, and source [12] (Times of India) states that the Warriors won the previous meeting 148-106. But the key here is the specific game on April 9. \n\nLooking at source [2], a YouTube video titled \"WARRIORS vs SPURS FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS APRIL 9, 2025\" describes the Warriors dominating and winning by a large margin. The transcript mentions the Warriors leading by 19, then 21, and eventually a \"monster win\" with Steph Curry having a big game. The final score mentioned in the video's transcript is Warriors winning by a significant margin, with phrases like \"monster win\" and \"outcome of this one was never in doubt.\"\n\nSource [10] (another YouTube video) also shows highlights where the Warriors are leading by 21 points in the fourth quarter, and the commentary mentions a \"monster win\" for the Warriors. \n\nSource [9] (Scores24) predicts a Warriors victory with a -15.5 spread, and source [14] (Sporting Post) gives the Warriors an 80% win probability, noting their recent form and the Spurs' struggles. \n\nHowever, there's conflicting information in source [1] and [3] where the final score is listed as Spurs 104, Warriors 94. But considering the detailed play-by-play in [1] shows the game in the first quarter with the Warriors leading 9-0, which might be a live game feed error. The box score in [3] might be incorrectly formatted, showing the Spurs with 0 points in later quarters, which doesn't make sense. \n\nThe YouTube videos [2] and [10] are more recent and provide detailed commentary indicating a Warriors victory. Additionally, source [12] mentions the Warriors' previous 148-106 win and that Stephen Curry was cleared to play, which aligns with the highlights showing his performance. \n\nGiven the conflicting data in some sources but strong evidence from multiple video highlights and predictions favoring the Warriors, it's likely that the Warriors won the game on April 9. The ESPN box score might have a formatting error or mislabeling. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (Warriors).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "critique": "The response from the solver is thorough and demonstrates a careful examination of multiple sources to ascertain the outcome of the Spurs vs. Warriors game. The solver navigated through conflicting information effectively, relying on more recent and detailed sources such as YouTube videos and live game highlights to conclude that the Warriors won. The critique of potential errors in ESPN's box score and the alignment of multiple sources supporting a Warriors victory strengthen the recommendation. The response also aligns with the market sentiment, which moderately favors the Warriors, supporting the solver's conclusion.",
        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1744259319 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-10 04:28:39 UTC",
