  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743966887 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 19:14:47 UTC",

The current date is April 6, 2025, so the game date has passed. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning the game on April 5.

Result [4] mentions a canceled spring training game in March 2025, but that's not the regular season game in question. Result [6] talks about a Nationals game postponement, which is unrelated. All other results, like [1], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], and [11], consistently report the game took place on April 5 with the Athletics winning 7-4. \n\nThere's no indication of postponement or cancellation for this specific game. The Rockies' triple play in the second inning (result [5] and [7]) and the Athletics' home runs (result [1], [8]) are part of the game's details.

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Colorado Rockies vs. Athletics game scheduled for April 5, 2025, at 8:10 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if the Rockies win, it's p2; if the Athletics win, p1; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is April 6, 2025, so the game date has passed. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning the game on April 5. For example, result [1] from CBS Sports details the Athletics' 7-4 win over the Rockies on April 5. Similarly, result [9] from Bleacher Report confirms the same score, and result [5] from the Durango Herald also reports the Rockies' loss. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Result [3] discusses a Rockies game postponed due to snow in 2024, but that's a different year. Result [4] mentions a canceled spring training game in March 2025, but that's not the regular season game in question. Result [6] talks about a Nationals game postponement, which is unrelated. All other results, like [1], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], and [11], consistently report the game took place on April 5 with the Athletics winning 7-4. \n\nThere's no indication of postponement or cancellation for this specific game. The Rockies' triple play in the second inning (result [5] and [7]) and the Athletics' home runs (result [1], [8]) are part of the game's details. Since the game was completed and the Athletics won, the resolution should be p1. All sources align, so no conflicting information exists. The user's ancillary data specifies the conditions, and the outcome meets the p1 criteria.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
