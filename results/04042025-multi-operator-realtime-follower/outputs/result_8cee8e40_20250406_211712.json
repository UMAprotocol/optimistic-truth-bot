  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743973857 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 21:10:57 UTC",

The resolution depends on the final score difference, and the source is NCAA.com. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-06 21:10:57 UTC, which is 9:10 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 3:00 PM ET on April 6. Since 3 PM ET is 19:00 UTC, the game has already concluded by the current time. So, the event has occurred, and I need to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [5] provides a live update stating that after the third quarter, UConn led 62-42. If the game ended with that 20-point lead, UConn would have won by 20 points, which is more than 6. However, I need to confirm the final score. \n\nResult [13] mentions that UConn holds a double-digit lead in the championship game, but it doesn't give the final score. Result [6] includes staff predictions from April 6, with picks like UConn 82-75 and 81-73, which are 7 and 8-point margins, both over 6. However, these are predictions, not actual results. \n\nResult [5] also mentions that UConn dominated the third quarter to build a 20-point lead entering the fourth. If they maintained that lead, the final margin would be 20. But I need the exact final score. \n\nResult [10] states that UConn aims for its first title since 2016 and references their prior 87-58 win over South Carolina in February. However, that's a regular-season game, not the championship. \n\nResult [11] from ESPN's live updates doesn't provide the final score but notes that UConn dominated their previous meeting. Result [12] mentions UConn's 85-51 win over UCLA in the semifinals but not the championship game. \n\nSince the user provided the current date as April 6, 2025, and the game was at 3 PM ET (19:00 UTC), which is before the current timestamp of 21:10 UTC, the game is over. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final score of the championship game. The most recent update in the search results is from [5], which only goes up to the third quarter. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit final score in the provided sources, I need to infer based on available data. The ancillary data states that if no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The user's query's resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. \n\nSince the search results don't confirm the final score, but the third-quarter update shows a 20-point lead, and UConn's dominant performance in the semifinals, it's reasonable to infer that UConn maintained their lead and won by 6+ points. However, without explicit confirmation, there's uncertainty. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Given UConn's prior 29-point win over South Carolina and their strong tournament performance, the probable outcome is a UConn win by 6+. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2: Yes.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
