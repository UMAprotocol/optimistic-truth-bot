  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743986016 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-07 00:33:36 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the San Antonio Spurs will make the NBA Playoffs for the 2024-25 season. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. The key here is to determine if the Spurs have been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs based on the current standings and remaining games.\n\nFirst, I need to check the latest standings. From the search results, the Spurs are 13th in the Western Conference with a 32-44 record as of March 28 [1][2][3]. They're trailing the 10th seed, which is the cutoff for the play-in tournament, by 4 games. However, the user specified that making the Play-In doesn't count; they need to be in the top 8 for the actual playoffs. Wait, no\u2014the note says reaching the Play-In doesn't qualify. The Play-In is for the 7th and 8th seeds. So the Spurs need to be in the top 6 to avoid the Play-In, but even making the Play-In (7th-10th) doesn't count for this market. The market resolves to Yes only if they make the playoffs proper, which requires being in the top 6 or winning the Play-In. But the note says \"To make the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs, a team must earn one of the 16 spots in the postseason bracket.\" Wait, the NBA playoffs have 16 teams (8 from each conference), so the top 6 in each conference automatically qualify, and the 7th and 8th are determined by the Play-In. So if the Spurs make it through the Play-In as 7th or 8th, they would be in the playoffs. But the note says \"reaching the Play-In Tournament will not qualify as making the Playoffs.\" That's confusing. Wait, the note clarifies: \"To make the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs, a team must earn one of the 16 spots in the postseason bracket.\" So the Play-In is part of the process to get into the 16-team bracket. So if a team is in the Play-In, they haven't made the playoffs yet; they have to win the Play-In to get the 7th or 8th seed. Therefore, the market resolves to Yes only if the team is in the top 6 or wins the Play-In to get the 7th or 8th seed. But the note says \"reaching the Play-In Tournament will not qualify as making the Playoffs.\" So even if they are in the Play-In, it's not enough. They have to actually make the playoffs by winning the Play-In. However, the resolution condition says if they are mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, the market resolves to No. So the key is whether the Spurs can still make the Play-In, because if they can't, they can't get into the playoffs. \n\nLooking at the search results, as of April 2nd, the Spurs were 5 games behind Sacramento with 7 games left [10]. Another source from April 3rd mentions the Spurs are 4.5 games behind the 10th spot with 8 games left [17]. The latest data in the search results is up to April 6th, where the Spurs' record is 32-44 [1][2][3]. The NBA schedule shows they have a few games left, but the exact number isn't clear. Let's check the standings. The 10th seed in the West is Sacramento Kings with 36-39 [19], but that's as of March 31. Wait, the ESPN source from April 4th [19] lists the Western Conference Play-In standings with the 10th seed as Sacramento Kings at 36-39, 7.5 games behind the 6th seed. The Spurs are 32-44, which is 4.5 games behind the Kings. With 6 games left, the maximum the Spurs can win is 38 games. If the Kings have 36 wins and 39 losses, they have 7 games left (assuming 82-game season). Wait, the Spurs have 32 wins and 44 losses, so 76 games played, leaving 6 games. The Kings at 36-39 have 75 games played, leaving 7 games. So the Kings can potentially win up to 43 games. The Spurs can only reach 38. Even if the Kings lose all their remaining games, they'd have 36 wins. The Spurs would need to win 6 games to reach 38, which would surpass the Kings' 36. But there are other teams between them. For example, the 9th seed Mavericks at 37-39 [19], so they have 6 games left. If the Mavericks lose all, they'd have 37 wins. The Spurs would need 38 to pass them. But the Spurs can only get to 38. So if the Spurs win all 6, they'd be 38-44. The Kings could be at 36-46 if they lose all 7. So the Spurs would be ahead. But there are multiple teams ahead. The 10th seed is Kings at 36-39, so if they lose all, they're 36-46. The Spurs at 38-44 would be better. But the 9th seed Mavericks are 37-39, so if they lose all, they're 37-45. The Spurs would need to pass both. So if the Spurs win all 6, they'd be 38-44. The Mavericks could be 37-45, Kings 36-46. Then the Spurs would be 9th. But the Play-In is 7-10. So even if the Spurs get to 9th, they can participate in the Play-In. But the user's note says that if they are mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, the market resolves to No. So the question is: Can the Spurs still make the Play-In (i.e., reach 10th place)? \n\nAs of April 7th (current date in the query), the Spurs have 32-44, with 6 games left. The 10th seed Kings are 36-39 with 7 games left. The Spurs are 4 games behind. If the Kings lose all 7, they finish at 36-46. The Spurs need to win 4 games to reach 36-46, but they have 6 games left. If they win 4, they'd be 36-46, same as Kings, but the tiebreaker would matter. However, the Kings have more wins if they have the same record. Wait, no\u2014if both are 36-46, it depends on head-to-head. But without knowing the tiebreaker, the key is whether the Spurs can catch up. The maximum the Spurs can get is 38 wins. The Kings can get up to 43. So if the Kings win even 1 game, they'd be 37-45, which the Spurs can't reach if they max at 38. Wait, no\u2014if the Kings have 36-39, and 7 games left, their maximum is 36+7=43 wins. But the Spurs can only get to 38. So if the Kings win any games, the Spurs can't catch them. But the Spurs need to pass the Kings to get into the 10th spot. So the Spurs' magic number is the number of games they need to win plus the Kings' losses to surpass them. For example, if the Spurs have 6 games left, and the Kings have 7, the Spurs need to make up 4 games. If the Spurs win 4, and the Kings lose 4, then the Spurs would be 36-46, Kings 36-43 (wait, Kings have 36-39, so 36+4 losses=40 losses, so 36-43? No, initial record is 36-39, so 75 games played. 7 remaining: if they lose 4, they'd be 36-43 (36 wins, 39+4=43 losses). Then Spurs have 32+4=36 wins, 44+2=46 losses. So both 36-46 and 36-43. Wait, no\u2014the Kings' current record is 36-39, so 75 games. 7 left: if they lose 4, they have 36+0=36 wins, 39+4=43 losses, and 3 wins? No, total games would be 36+43=79, which is 75+7=82. So if they lose 4, they have 36 wins and 43 losses, with 3 games unaccounted for. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think differently. The Kings have 36 wins and 39 losses, with 7 games left. The maximum losses they can have is 39 +7=46. So the worst they can do is 36-46. The Spurs have 32-44, 6 games left. The best they can do is 38-44. So 38 wins vs Kings' 36. So if the Spurs win all 6, they have 38 wins. The Kings, if they lose all 7, have 36. So Spurs would be ahead. But there are other teams in between, like the Mavericks at 37-39. If the Mavericks lose all their remaining games, they'd have 37 wins. The Spurs would have 38, so they'd pass them. So in that scenario, the Spurs could be 9th or 10th. But this requires the Spurs to win all their remaining games and the Kings and Mavericks to lose all theirs, which is highly unlikely. However, mathematically, it's still possible. Therefore, the Spurs are not yet mathematically eliminated from the Play-In. But the user's query is about making the playoffs, which requires getting through the Play-In. However, the market resolves to No if they are eliminated from the Play-In. Since they are not yet mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, the market can't resolve yet. Wait, but the current date is April 7th, and the Spurs have 6 games left. Let's check the latest standings. The search result [16] from April 4th mentions the Spurs are 32-44 and mathematically alive but face an uphill battle. Another source [10] from April 3rd says the Spurs are 5 games behind with 7 left, but that's a different timeline. Wait, the user's current timestamp is April 7th, 2025. The search result [16] (NBA releases 2025 Play-In schedule on April 4th) states the Spurs are 32-44 and mathematically alive. The ESPN source [19] as of April 4th lists the 10th seed in the West as Sacramento Kings at 36-39, 7.5 games behind 6th. The Spurs are 32-44, which is 4.5 games behind the Kings. With 6 games left, the Spurs can maximum reach 38 wins. The Kings have 7 games left, so they can reach 43 wins. If the Kings win just 2 more games, they'd have 38 wins, which the Spurs can't surpass even if they win all 6. Therefore, the Spurs' elimination number is the number of Kings' wins needed to eliminate them. The elimination number is calculated as (Kings' wins + Spurs' remaining games - Spurs' current wins) +1. So Kings have 36 wins, Spurs have 32. Spurs have 6 games left. Elimination number = (36 +6 -32) +1 = 11. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the formula is: Elimination number = (Number of games remaining for Spurs + 1) - (Spurs' wins - Kings' losses). Wait, maybe I should use the standard elimination number formula. The elimination number for the Spurs to catch the Kings is: Kings' wins +1 - Spurs' wins. So 36 +1 -32 =5. Then, the elimination number is 5. Any combination of Kings wins or Spurs losses totaling 5 would eliminate the Spurs. Since the Spurs have 6 games left, if the Kings win 5 games, or the Spurs lose 5, or a combination, the Spurs can't catch up. But the Kings have 7 games left. If the Kings win 2 more games, they'd have 38 wins. The Spurs can only get to 38, but the Kings would have more wins, so the Spurs can't pass them. Wait, the Kings have 36 wins, 39 losses. If they win 2 more, they have 38-41, with 3 games left. The Spurs can max at 38-44. The Kings would have a better record (38-41 vs 38-44), so the Kings would be ahead. Therefore, the elimination number is 2. If the Kings win 2 more games, the Spurs can't catch them. As of April 7th, have the Kings already won enough games to reach that? The search results don't have updated standings beyond April 6th. The user's current date is April 7th. Assuming the Kings haven't played all their games yet, the Spurs' elimination number is 2. If the Kings win any 2 of their remaining games, the Spurs can't catch them. If the Kings have already won 2 games since April 4th, then the Spurs are eliminated. But without the latest data, it's hard to say. However, the user provided search results up to April 6th. The latest game mentioned in the Spurs' schedule [7] is on April 13th, but the record is listed as 31-43 as of some point. There's inconsistency in the records across sources, but the key is that as of April 7th, the Spurs are 32-44 with 6 games left, and the Kings are 36-39 with 7 left. The elimination number is 2. If the Kings have already won 2 games after April 4th, then the Spurs are eliminated. But the search results don't show that. Therefore, based on the information available, the Spurs are not yet mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, so the market can't resolve to No yet. However, the user's note says that if it's impossible for them to make the playoffs, resolve immediately. Since making the playoffs requires getting through the Play-In, and they haven't been eliminated from the Play-In, the market remains unresolved. But wait, the user's query is about making the playoffs, which requires being in the top 8. The Play-In determines the 7th and 8th seeds. So even if the Spurs make the Play-In, they still have to win to get into the playoffs. But the market resolves to Yes only if they make the playoffs, not just the Play-In. However, the resolution condition says if they are mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, resolve to No. Since they haven't been eliminated from the Play-In yet, the market can't resolve yet. Therefore, the answer should be p3 (unknown). But wait, the user's current date is April 7th, and the regular season ends around April 13th. The Spurs have 6 games left. The Kings have 7 games left. The Spurs' chances are very slim, but mathematically possible. Therefore, the market can't resolve yet, so the recommendation is p3. However, looking at the search result [10] from April 3rd, it says the Spurs are mathematically eligible but 5 games behind with 7 left. Another source [17] from April 2nd says they're 4.5 games behind with 8 left. As of April 7th, with 6 games left, the Spurs are 4 games behind the 10th seed. If the 10th seed has 36 wins, and the Spurs have 32, with 6 games left, the Spurs need to make up 4 games. The elimination number here would be (36 - 32) +1 =5. So any combination of Spurs losses and Kings wins totaling 5 would eliminate them. Since the Spurs have 6 games, if they lose 5, they can't catch up. But the Kings can also win games. For example, if the Kings win 1 game, the elimination number decreases by 1. So if the Kings win 1, the elimination number becomes 4. If the Spurs lose 1, it's 3, etc. Given the complexity, but based on the available data, the Spurs are not yet mathematically eliminated, so the market can't resolve to No. Therefore, the recommendation is p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the current date is April 7th, and the regular season ends around April 13th. The event (Spurs making playoffs) hasn't occurred yet, so it's a future event. Wait, the resolution condition says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the event here is whether the Spurs make the playoffs, which is determined by the end of the regular season. Since the current date is April 7th and the season ends around April 13th, the event hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if the event is in the future, return p4. But wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50, and p4: cannot be resolved now. The user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the note in the query says: \"If at any point it becomes impossible for this team to make the Playoffs based on the rules of the NBA (e.g. they are mathematically eliminated from reaching the Play-In), this market will resolve immediately to 'No'.\" So if they are mathematically eliminated, resolve to p1. If not, and the event is in the future, resolve to p4. But the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the current timestamp is April 7th, and the season is ongoing. The Spurs haven't been mathematically eliminated yet, so the event is still possible but hasn't occurred. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the event date is in the future, the recommendation is p4. But wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" But in this case, the event (Spurs making playoffs) is determined by the end of the regular season, which is in the future (April 13th). Therefore, the event is scheduled for a future date, so the recommendation is p4. However, the resolution conditions in the ancillary data have p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50), but the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" Therefore, despite the Spurs' slim chances, since the event hasn't occurred yet and the date is in the future, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. The key here is to determine if the Spurs have been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs based on the current standings and remaining games.\n\nFirst, I need to check the latest standings. From the search results, the Spurs are 13th in the Western Conference with a 32-44 record as of March 28 [1][2][3]. They're trailing the 10th seed, which is the cutoff for the play-in tournament, by 4 games. However, the user specified that making the Play-In doesn't count; they need to be in the top 8 for the actual playoffs. Wait, no\u2014the note says reaching the Play-In doesn't qualify. The Play-In is for the 7th and 8th seeds. So the Spurs need to be in the top 6 to avoid the Play-In, but even making the Play-In (7th-10th) doesn't count for this market. The market resolves to Yes only if they make the playoffs proper, which requires being in the top 6 or winning the Play-In. But the note says \"To make the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs, a team must earn one of the 16 spots in the postseason bracket.\" Wait, the NBA playoffs have 16 teams (8 from each conference), so the top 6 in each conference automatically qualify, and the 7th and 8th are determined by the Play-In. So if the Spurs make it through the Play-In as 7th or 8th, they would be in the playoffs. But the note says \"reaching the Play-In Tournament will not qualify as making the Playoffs.\" That's confusing. Wait, the note clarifies: \"To make the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs, a team must earn one of the 16 spots in the postseason bracket.\" So the Play-In is part of the process to get into the 16-team bracket. So if a team is in the Play-In, they haven't made the playoffs yet; they have to win the Play-In to get the 7th or 8th seed. Therefore, the market resolves to Yes only if the team is in the top 6 or wins the Play-In to get the 7th or 8th seed. But the note says \"reaching the Play-In Tournament will not qualify as making the Playoffs.\" So even if they are in the Play-In, it's not enough. They have to actually make the playoffs by winning the Play-In. However, the resolution condition says if they are mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, the market resolves to No. So the key is whether the Spurs can still make the Play-In, because if they can't, they can't get into the playoffs. \n\nLooking at the search results, as of April 2nd, the Spurs were 5 games behind Sacramento with 7 games left [10]. Another source from April 3rd mentions the Spurs are 4.5 games behind the 10th spot with 8 games left [17]. The latest data in the search results is up to April 6th, where the Spurs' record is 32-44 [1][2][3]. The NBA schedule shows they have a few games left, but the exact number isn't clear. Let's check the standings. The 10th seed in the West is Sacramento Kings with 36-39 [19], but that's as of March 31. Wait, the ESPN source from April 4th [19] lists the Western Conference Play-In standings with the 10th seed as Sacramento Kings at 36-39, 7.5 games behind the 6th seed. The Spurs are 32-44, which is 4.5 games behind the Kings. With 6 games left, the maximum the Spurs can win is 38 games. If the Kings have 36 wins and 39 losses, they have 7 games left (assuming 82-game season). Wait, the Spurs have 32 wins and 44 losses, so 76 games played, leaving 6 games. The Kings at 36-39 have 75 games played, leaving 7 games. So the Kings can potentially win up to 43 games. The Spurs can only reach 38. Even if the Kings lose all their remaining games, they'd have 36 wins. The Spurs would need to win 6 games to reach 38, which would surpass the Kings' 36. But there are other teams between them. For example, the 9th seed Mavericks at 37-39 [19], so they have 6 games left. If the Mavericks lose all, they'd have 37 wins. The Spurs would need 38 to pass them. But the Spurs can only get to 38. So if the Spurs win all 6, they'd be 38-44. The Kings could be at 36-46 if they lose all 7. So the Spurs would be ahead. But there are multiple teams ahead. The 10th seed is Kings at 36-39, so if they lose all, they're 36-46. The Spurs at 38-44 would be better. But the 9th seed Mavericks are 37-39, so if they lose all, they're 37-45. The Spurs would need to pass both. So if the Spurs win all 6, they'd be 38-44. The Mavericks could be 37-45, Kings 36-46. Then the Spurs would be 9th. But the Play-In is 7-10. So even if the Spurs get to 9th, they can participate in the Play-In. But the user's note says that if they are mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, the market resolves to No. So the question is: Can the Spurs still make the Play-In (i.e., reach 10th place)? \n\nAs of April 7th (current date in the query), the Spurs have 32-44, with 6 games left. The 10th seed Kings are 36-39 with 7 games left. The Spurs are 4 games behind. If the Kings lose all 7, they finish at 36-46. The Spurs need to win 4 games to reach 36-46, but they have 6 games left. If they win 4, they'd be 36-46, same as Kings, but the tiebreaker would matter. However, the Kings have more wins if they have the same record. Wait, no\u2014if both are 36-46, it depends on head-to-head. But without knowing the tiebreaker, the key is whether the Spurs can catch up. The maximum the Spurs can get is 38 wins. The Kings can get up to 43. So if the Kings win even 1 game, they'd be 37-45, which the Spurs can't reach if they max at 38.

But the Spurs need to pass the Kings to get into the 10th spot. So the Spurs' magic number is the number of games they need to win plus the Kings' losses to surpass them. For example, if the Spurs have 6 games left, and the Kings have 7, the Spurs need to make up 4 games. If the Spurs win 4, and the Kings lose 4, then the Spurs would be 36-46, Kings 36-43 (wait, Kings have 36-39, so 36+4 losses=40 losses, so 36-43? No, initial record is 36-39, so 75 games played. 7 remaining: if they lose 4, they'd be 36-43 (36 wins, 39+4=43 losses). Then Spurs have 32+4=36 wins, 44+2=46 losses. So both 36-46 and 36-43. Wait, no\u2014the Kings' current record is 36-39, so 75 games. 7 left: if they lose 4, they have 36+0=36 wins, 39+4=43 losses, and 3 wins? No, total games would be 36+43=79, which is 75+7=82. So if they lose 4, they have 36 wins and 43 losses, with 3 games unaccounted for. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think differently. The Kings have 36 wins and 39 losses, with 7 games left. The maximum losses they can have is 39 +7=46. So the worst they can do is 36-46. The Spurs have 32-44, 6 games left. The best they can do is 38-44. So 38 wins vs Kings' 36. So if the Spurs win all 6, they have 38 wins. The Kings, if they lose all 7, have 36. So Spurs would be ahead. But there are other teams in between, like the Mavericks at 37-39. If the Mavericks lose all their remaining games, they'd have 37 wins. The Spurs would have 38, so they'd pass them. So in that scenario, the Spurs could be 9th or 10th. But this requires the Spurs to win all their remaining games and the Kings and Mavericks to lose all theirs, which is highly unlikely. However, mathematically, it's still possible. Therefore, the Spurs are not yet mathematically eliminated from the Play-In. But the user's query is about making the playoffs, which requires getting through the Play-In. However, the market resolves to No if they are eliminated from the Play-In. Since they are not yet mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, the market can't resolve yet. Wait, but the current date is April 7th, and the Spurs have 6 games left. Let's check the latest standings. The search result [16] from April 4th mentions the Spurs are 32-44 and mathematically alive but face an uphill battle. Another source [10] from April 3rd says the Spurs are 5 games behind with 7 left, but that's a different timeline. Wait, the user's current timestamp is April 7th, 2025. The search result [16] (NBA releases 2025 Play-In schedule on April 4th) states the Spurs are 32-44 and mathematically alive. The ESPN source [19] as of April 4th lists the 10th seed in the West as Sacramento Kings at 36-39, 7.5 games behind 6th. The Spurs are 32-44, which is 4.5 games behind the Kings. With 6 games left, the Spurs can maximum reach 38 wins. The Kings have 7 games left, so they can reach 43 wins. If the Kings win just 2 more games, they'd have 38 wins, which the Spurs can't surpass even if they win all 6. Therefore, the Spurs' elimination number is the number of Kings' wins needed to eliminate them. The elimination number is calculated as (Kings' wins + Spurs' remaining games - Spurs' current wins) +1. So Kings have 36 wins, Spurs have 32. Spurs have 6 games left. Elimination number = (36 +6 -32) +1 = 11. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the formula is: Elimination number = (Number of games remaining for Spurs + 1) - (Spurs' wins - Kings' losses). Wait, maybe I should use the standard elimination number formula. The elimination number for the Spurs to catch the Kings is: Kings' wins +1 - Spurs' wins. So 36 +1 -32 =5. Then, the elimination number is 5. Any combination of Kings wins or Spurs losses totaling 5 would eliminate the Spurs. Since the Spurs have 6 games left, if the Kings win 5 games, or the Spurs lose 5, or a combination, the Spurs can't catch up. But the Kings have 7 games left. If the Kings win 2 more games, they'd have 38 wins. The Spurs can only get to 38, but the Kings would have more wins, so the Spurs can't pass them. Wait, the Kings have 36 wins, 39 losses. If they win 2 more, they have 38-41, with 3 games left. The Spurs can max at 38-44. The Kings would have a better record (38-41 vs 38-44), so the Kings would be ahead. Therefore, the elimination number is 2. If the Kings win 2 more games, the Spurs can't catch them. As of April 7th, have the Kings already won enough games to reach that? The search results don't have updated standings beyond April 6th. The user's current date is April 7th. Assuming the Kings haven't played all their games yet, the Spurs' elimination number is 2. If the Kings win any 2 of their remaining games, the Spurs can't catch them. If the Kings have already won 2 games since April 4th, then the Spurs are eliminated. But without the latest data, it's hard to say. However, the user provided search results up to April 6th. The latest game mentioned in the Spurs' schedule [7] is on April 13th, but the record is listed as 31-43 as of some point. There's inconsistency in the records across sources, but the key is that as of April 7th, the Spurs are 32-44 with 6 games left, and the Kings are 36-39 with 7 left. The elimination number is 2. If the Kings have already won 2 games after April 4th, then the Spurs are eliminated. But the search results don't show that. Therefore, based on the information available, the Spurs are not yet mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, so the market can't resolve to No yet. However, the user's note says that if it's impossible for them to make the playoffs, resolve immediately. Since making the playoffs requires getting through the Play-In, and they haven't been eliminated from the Play-In, the market remains unresolved. But wait, the user's query is about making the playoffs, which requires being in the top 8. The Play-In determines the 7th and 8th seeds. So even if the Spurs make the Play-In, they still have to win to get into the playoffs. But the market resolves to Yes only if they make the playoffs, not just the Play-In. However, the resolution condition says if they are mathematically eliminated from the Play-In, resolve to No. Since they haven't been eliminated from the Play-In yet, the market can't resolve yet. Therefore, the answer should be p3 (unknown). But wait, the user's current date is April 7th, and the regular season ends around April 13th. The Spurs have 6 games left. The Kings have 7 games left. The Spurs' chances are very slim, but mathematically possible. Therefore, the market can't resolve yet, so the recommendation is p3. However, looking at the search result [10] from April 3rd, it says the Spurs are mathematically eligible but 5 games behind with 7 left. Another source [17] from April 2nd says they're 4.5 games behind with 8 left. As of April 7th, with 6 games left, the Spurs are 4 games behind the 10th seed. If the 10th seed has 36 wins, and the Spurs have 32, with 6 games left, the Spurs need to make up 4 games. The elimination number here would be (36 - 32) +1 =5. So any combination of Spurs losses and Kings wins totaling 5 would eliminate them. Since the Spurs have 6 games, if they lose 5, they can't catch up. But the Kings can also win games. For example, if the Kings win 1 game, the elimination number decreases by 1. So if the Kings win 1, the elimination number becomes 4. If the Spurs lose 1, it's 3, etc. Given the complexity, but based on the available data, the Spurs are not yet mathematically eliminated, so the market can't resolve to No. Therefore, the recommendation is p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the current date is April 7th, and the regular season ends around April 13th. The event (Spurs making playoffs) hasn't occurred yet, so it's a future event. Wait, the resolution condition says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the event here is whether the Spurs make the playoffs, which is determined by the end of the regular season. Since the current date is April 7th and the season ends around April 13th, the event hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if the event is in the future, return p4. But wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50, and p4: cannot be resolved now. The user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the note in the query says: \"If at any point it becomes impossible for this team to make the Playoffs based on the rules of the NBA (e.g. they are mathematically eliminated from reaching the Play-In), this market will resolve immediately to 'No'.\" So if they are mathematically eliminated, resolve to p1. If not, and the event is in the future, resolve to p4. But the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the current timestamp is April 7th, and the season is ongoing. The Spurs haven't been mathematically eliminated yet, so the event is still possible but hasn't occurred. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the event date is in the future, the recommendation is p4. But wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" But in this case, the event (Spurs making playoffs) is determined by the end of the regular season, which is in the future (April 13th). Therefore, the event is scheduled for a future date, so the recommendation is p4. However, the resolution conditions in the ancillary data have p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50), but the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" Therefore, despite the Spurs' slim chances, since the event hasn't occurred yet and the date is in the future, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743986016 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-07 00:33:36 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt.
