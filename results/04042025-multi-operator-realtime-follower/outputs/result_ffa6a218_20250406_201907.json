  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743970490 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 20:14:50 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Mets vs. Blue Jays game on April 6, 2025. First, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date is April 6, 2025, and the game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET. The timestamp provided is 8:14 PM UTC, which is 4:14 PM ET. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the game was at 1:40 PM ET, and the current time is 4:14 PM ET, the game should be over. But looking at the search results, there's a CBS Sports link from April 6 about the game, and the ESPN link shows live coverage. Hmm, maybe the game is still ongoing or just finished.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [1] is from April 6 and describes the Mets' 3-2 comeback win on April 5. Result [4] mentions the series finale on April 6, with the Mets looking to complete a sweep. The ESPN link [5] shows live coverage of the April 6 game, but the details are from the previous day. Wait, the user's query is about the April 6 game. The ancillary data specifies the market resolves based on that game. However, the current timestamp is April 6, 8:16 PM UTC, which is 4:16 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET, so it should have concluded by now. But the search results don't have the final score for April 6. The latest info is from April 5. The ESPN page [5] might be a live score, but it's showing data from the previous games. There's a mention in [8] of the game on April 6 at 5:40 PM, but that's conflicting. Wait, the user's query says the game is scheduled for April 6 at 1:40 PM ET. The search results have a mix of April 5 and April 6 content. The key is to determine if the April 6 game has been played and what the result was. Since the current time is after the scheduled game time, but the search results don't provide the outcome, I need to check if there's any info. Result [4] is an expert pick for the April 6 game, but it doesn't have the result. The ESPN link [5] is a live score page, but the data is from April 5. The Fox Sports link [6] is from April 5. The YouTube links [2][3][7] are also from April 5. The ABC7 link [9] is from April 4. So, all the search results provided are from before April 6 or about the April 5 game. There's no information on the April 6 game's outcome. Therefore, based on the provided data, the game on April 6 hasn't been reported yet. However, the current timestamp is after the scheduled game time. If the game was played as scheduled and no sources report a postponement or cancellation, but the results aren't available in the provided context, the resolution would depend on whether the event occurred. Since the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no info is available, but the market conditions specify p2 for Mets win, p1 for Blue Jays, etc. However, without any data on the April 6 game, it's unclear. Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the date. The ancillary data mentions the game on April 6, but the search results are about the April 5 game. The user might have intended to ask about the April 5 game, but the query is for April 6. Given the confusion, I need to check the exact event. The user's query is about the April 6 game. Since the current time is after the scheduled time, but no search results provide the outcome, and the market resolution conditions say if the game is postponed or canceled. Since there's no info on postponement, and the game was supposed to happen, but no result is available in the context, perhaps the market should resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's risky. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the sources just aren't in the provided context. But according to the given search results, there's no info on the April 6 game. Therefore, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve) if the event is in the future, but the event date is today. Wait, the current timestamp is April 6, 8:16 PM UTC, which is 4:16 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET, so it's in the past. However, if the game was played and no sources are provided, but the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs. Since the provided URLs don't have the April 6 result, and the event is in the past, but no info, the resolution would be p4. But the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Blue Jays, p2 for Mets. Without any data, perhaps it's unresolved. But the instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. But wait, the user might have intended the April 5 game, which the Mets won. But the query specifically says April 6. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the date, and the game in question is April 5. But the query clearly states April 6. Given the provided context doesn't include the April 6 game's result, and the event is in the past, but no sources confirm the outcome, the resolution should be p4. However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? The Mets and Blue Jays are playing, and the previous games were split. The Mets won on April 5, and the series finale is April 6. Without data, it's unclear. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Mets vs. Blue Jays game on April 6, 2025. First, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current date is April 6, 2025, and the game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET. The timestamp provided is 8:14 PM UTC, which is 4:14 PM ET. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the game was at 1:40 PM ET, and the current time is 4:14 PM ET, the game should be over. But looking at the search results, there's a CBS Sports link from April 6 about the game, and the ESPN link shows live coverage. Hmm, maybe the game is still ongoing or just finished.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [1] is from April 6 and describes the Mets' 3-2 comeback win on April 5. Result [4] mentions the series finale on April 6, with the Mets looking to complete a sweep. The ESPN link [5] shows live coverage of the April 6 game, but the details are from the previous day. Wait, the user's query is about the April 6 game. The ancillary data specifies the market resolves based on that game. However, the current timestamp is April 6, 8:16 PM UTC, which is 4:16 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET, so it should have concluded by now. But the search results don't have the final score for April 6. The latest info is from April 5. The ESPN page [5] might be a live score, but it's showing data from the previous games. There's a mention in [8] of the game on April 6 at 5:40 PM, but that's conflicting. Wait, the user's query says the game is scheduled for April 6 at 1:40 PM ET. The search results have a mix of April 5 and April 6 content. The key is to determine if the April 6 game has been played and what the result was. Since the current time is after the scheduled game time, but the search results don't provide the outcome, I need to check if there's any info. Result [4] is an expert pick for the April 6 game, but it doesn't have the result. The ESPN link [5] is a live score page, but the data is from April 5. The Fox Sports link [6] is from April 5. The YouTube links [2][3][7] are also from April 5. The ABC7 link [9] is from April 4. So, all the search results provided are from before April 6 or about the April 5 game. There's no information on the April 6 game's outcome. Therefore, based on the provided data, the game on April 6 hasn't been reported yet. However, the current timestamp is after the scheduled game time. If the game was played as scheduled and no sources report a postponement or cancellation, but the results aren't available in the provided context, the resolution would depend on whether the event occurred. Since the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is in the past and no info is available, but the market conditions specify p2 for Mets win, p1 for Blue Jays, etc. However, without any data on the April 6 game, it's unclear. Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the date. The ancillary data mentions the game on April 6, but the search results are about the April 5 game. The user might have intended to ask about the April 5 game, but the query is for April 6. Given the confusion, I need to check the exact event. The user's query is about the April 6 game. Since the current time is after the scheduled time, but no search results provide the outcome, and the market resolution conditions say if the game is postponed or canceled. Since there's no info on postponement, and the game was supposed to happen, but no result is available in the context, perhaps the market should resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's risky. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the sources just aren't in the provided context. But according to the given search results, there's no info on the April 6 game. Therefore, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve) if the event is in the future, but the event date is today. Wait, the current timestamp is April 6, 8:16 PM UTC, which is 4:16 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 1:40 PM ET, so it's in the past. However, if the game was played and no sources are provided, but the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs. Since the provided URLs don't have the April 6 result, and the event is in the past, but no info, the resolution would be p4. But the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1 for Blue Jays, p2 for Mets. Without any data, perhaps it's unresolved. But the instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. But wait, the user might have intended the April 5 game, which the Mets won. But the query specifically says April 6. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the date, and the game in question is April 5. But the query clearly states April 6. Given the provided context doesn't include the April 6 game's result, and the event is in the past, but no sources confirm the outcome, the resolution should be p4. However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But how to determine that? The Mets and Blue Jays are playing, and the previous games were split. The Mets won on April 5, and the series finale is April 6. Without data, it's unclear. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
