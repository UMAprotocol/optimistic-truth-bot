  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743971411 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 20:30:11 UTC",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Kansas City Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles game on April 6, 2025, at 2:10 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if the Royals win, it's p2; if the Orioles win, p1; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-06 20:30:11 UTC, which is 8:30 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 2:10 PM ET, which is 18:10 UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, the event has already occurred. So, I don't need to consider postponement or cancellation unless there's info suggesting that.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources. Result [1] from kmmo.com mentions the Royals lost 8-1 on April 6, dropping their record to 3-5. The Orioles evened the series. Result [6] from YouTube highlights on April 5 shows the Orioles won 8-1, with Bobby Witt Jr. hitting a home run but the Royals losing. Result [2] from CBS Sports also confirms the Orioles' 8-1 victory on April 5, with details about the game. \n\nWait, the game in question is April 6, but some results mention April 5. Need to check the dates carefully. The query is about the April 6 game. Let me check the search results again. Result [3] from ESPN is a live score for the April 6 game, but the data is unavailable. Result [5] from Action Network lists the April 6 game with starting pitchers Kris Bubic and Cade Povich. Result [9] from leans.ai also discusses the April 6 game, predicting Orioles vs. Royals. However, the most recent results [1] and [6] mention the April 5 game where Orioles won 8-1, and the April 6 game is the next day. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game on April 6. The current date is April 6, 2025, 8:30 PM UTC. The game was at 2:10 PM ET, which is 18:10 UTC. So the game would have concluded by 18:10 UTC + a few hours. The search results [1] and [6] mention the April 5 game, but the April 6 game's outcome isn't directly mentioned. However, result [1] says, \"The Royals still have a chance to win their first series of the year when they take on Baltimore again Sunday afternoon. Kris Bubic gets the start for Kansas City, with first pitch at 1:10 p.m.\" Wait, the game time in the query is 2:10 PM ET, but here it's 1:10 PM. Maybe a discrepancy in time zones or reporting. \n\nLooking at result [10] from CapperTek, the game is on April 6 at 2:10 PM ET. Result [11] from RealGM also mentions the April 6 game with a prediction. However, none of the search results explicitly state the outcome of the April 6 game. The most recent result is [1] from April 6, which talks about the April 5 game and mentions the upcoming April 6 game but doesn't provide its result. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is April 6, 8:30 PM UTC. The game would have been played earlier that day. If the search results don't include the outcome, perhaps the game hasn't been reported yet in the provided sources. However, result [1] says the Royals lost on April 5 and the next game is April 6 with Kris Bubic starting. The other results [5], [9], [10], [11] are previews or odds for the April 6 game but don't have the result. \n\nBut the user provided search results up to [11], and none explicitly state the April 6 game's outcome. However, result [6] is a YouTube video titled \"Orioles vs. Royals Game Highlights (4/5/25)\" which might be April 5, and another video [4] from April 4. The lack of April 6 results suggests that the game might have been played but not yet reported in the provided sources. \n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say to use the provided sources. If the sources don't include the April 6 game result, but the event date is in the past, and no info is available, we have to infer. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. \n\nLooking at the starting pitchers for April 6: Kris Bubic for Royals and Cade Povich for Orioles (from result [5]). Bubic's stats aren't detailed here, but Povich is a rookie. The Orioles might have an edge, but without game results, it's uncertain. However, the ancillary data says if no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. But the user's instructions also say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on user prompt conditions. \n\nWait, the user's query's ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. But if it's played and no info, perhaps the Oracle should default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. However, the current sources don't have the game result. \n\nBut wait, result [1] is dated April 6 and mentions the April 5 game, and says the next game is April 6 with Kris Bubic starting. Since the current time is after the game, but the provided search results don't include the outcome, perhaps the Oracle should check if any sources mention the April 6 result. Since none do, and the event is in the past, but no info is available, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the most probable outcome? The ancillary data doesn't specify, but the user prompt's resolution conditions are based on the actual outcome. Since the sources don't report the April 6 game's result, but the event date has passed, the Oracle might have to default to p4. However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But without any data, it's impossible to know. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the dates. The query is about the April 6 game, but the search results include April 5 games. Maybe the April 6 game hasn't been played yet? Wait, the current date is April 6, 2025, 8:30 PM UTC. The game was at 2:10 PM ET, which is 18:10 UTC. So the game would have started at 18:10 UTC and likely ended by 21:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 20:30 UTC, which is before the game would have ended. Wait, no\u20142:10 PM ET is 18:10 UTC. If the game started at 18:10 UTC, and it's a baseball game lasting around 3 hours, it would end around 21:10 UTC. The current timestamp is 20:30 UTC, so the game is still in progress. Therefore, the event hasn't concluded yet, and the Oracle should return p4. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp in the problem is 2025-04-06 20:30:11 UTC, which is 8:30 PM UTC. The game started at 18:10 UTC (2:10 PM ET), so it's been about 2 hours and 20 minutes. A typical MLB game lasts about 3 hours, so the game might still be ongoing. Therefore, the event hasn't concluded, and the resolution should be p4. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still a future event. But in this case, the event's scheduled time has passed, but the game might still be in progress. The Oracle should check if the game has concluded. Since the provided search results don't include the outcome, and the current time is before the expected conclusion, the Oracle can't confirm the result and should return p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user provided it as 2025-04-06 20:30:11 UTC, which is 8:30 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 2:10 PM ET, which is 18:10 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 in April).

So the game should have already taken place.\n\nNow, looking at the search results. There are multiple sources indicating the outcome. Search result [1] from kmmo.com mentions the Orioles won 8-1 on April 5, but that's a previous game. Wait, the user's query is about the April 6 game. Let me check the dates carefully.\n\nLooking at the search results again: [1] is about the April 5 game where Orioles won 8-1. [3] is about the April 6 game's odds. [6] and [10] are YouTube highlights from April 5. [7] is an ESPN score page showing the April 6 game as \"Series tied 1-1\" with the Orioles winning 8-1. [8] from plaintextsports.com shows the final score on April 6 as Orioles 1, Royals 4, but that seems conflicting. Wait, [8] says Baltimore Orioles 4-6 Final 1 - 4 Kansas City Royals 4-5. But that might be a different game or a mistake. However, [11] from Yomiuri Shimbun mentions the April 5 game where Orioles won 8-1. [12] is about Ryan Mountcastle's performance on April 5.\n\nWait, there's confusion here. The user's query is about the April 6 game. The search results include [7] (ESPN) which shows the Orioles vs. Royals game on April 6 with a score of 8-1 Orioles, series tied 1-1. Also, [8] from plaintextsports.com lists the April 6 game as Orioles 1, Royals 4, but that might be a different source or an error. However, the ESPN source is more reliable. Additionally, [3] (Action Network) mentions the April 6 game with Orioles at Royals, and [7] clearly states the Orioles won 8-1 on April 6, tying the series. The YouTube highlights in [6] and [10] are from April 5, but [10] also references the April 5 game. \n\nWait, the key is to check the date of each search result. The user's query is about the April 6 game. The ESPN result [7] is dated April 6 and shows the Orioles won 8-1. The plaintextsports result [8] also dated April 6 but shows a different score. However, considering the ESPN source is more authoritative, and [7] explicitly states the Orioles won 8-1 on April 6, that's likely the correct outcome. The discrepancy in [8] might be a typo or a different game reference. \n\nTherefore, based on the most reliable source (ESPN), the Baltimore Orioles won the April 6 game against the Kansas City Royals with a score of 8-1. Thus, the resolution should be p1 (Baltimore Orioles).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user provided it as 2025-04-06 20:30:11 UTC, which is 8:30 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 2:10 PM ET, which is 18:10 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 in April). Wait, no, 2:10 PM ET would be 18:10 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). But the current time is 20:30 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the game should have already taken place.\n\nNow, looking at the search results. There are multiple sources indicating the outcome. Search result [1] from kmmo.com mentions the Orioles won 8-1 on April 5, but that's a previous game. Wait, the user's query is about the April 6 game. Let me check the dates carefully.\n\nLooking at the search results again: [1] is about the April 5 game where Orioles won 8-1. [3] is about the April 6 game's odds. [6] and [10] are YouTube highlights from April 5. [7] is an ESPN score page showing the April 6 game as \"Series tied 1-1\" with the Orioles winning 8-1. [8] from plaintextsports.com shows the final score on April 6 as Orioles 1, Royals 4, but that seems conflicting. Wait, [8] says Baltimore Orioles 4-6 Final 1 - 4 Kansas City Royals 4-5. But that might be a different game or a mistake. However, [11] from Yomiuri Shimbun mentions the April 5 game where Orioles won 8-1. [12] is about Ryan Mountcastle's performance on April 5.\n\nWait, there's confusion here. The user's query is about the April 6 game. The search results include [7] (ESPN) which shows the Orioles vs. Royals game on April 6 with a score of 8-1 Orioles, series tied 1-1. Also, [8] from plaintextsports.com lists the April 6 game as Orioles 1, Royals 4, but that might be a different source or an error. However, the ESPN source is more reliable. Additionally, [3] (Action Network) mentions the April 6 game with Orioles at Royals, and [7] clearly states the Orioles won 8-1 on April 6, tying the series. The YouTube highlights in [6] and [10] are from April 5, but [10] also references the April 5 game. \n\nWait, the key is to check the date of each search result. The user's query is about the April 6 game. The ESPN result [7] is dated April 6 and shows the Orioles won 8-1. The plaintextsports result [8] also dated April 6 but shows a different score. However, considering the ESPN source is more authoritative, and [7] explicitly states the Orioles won 8-1 on April 6, that's likely the correct outcome. The discrepancy in [8] might be a typo or a different game reference. \n\nTherefore, based on the most reliable source (ESPN), the Baltimore Orioles won the April 6 game against the Kansas City Royals with a score of 8-1. Thus, the resolution should be p1 (Baltimore Orioles).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Source [1] from kmmo.com dated 2025-04-06 reports that the Orioles routed the Royals 8-1. It mentions the Orioles scored early and often, with Bobby Witt Jr. hitting a solo homer for the Royals' only run. The article clearly states the Orioles won, so this is a strong indicator for p1.\n\n2. Source [2] from Fox Sports gives a prediction before the game, but the actual result isn't mentioned here. It's from April 5, so it's a preview. Not useful for the outcome.\n\n3. Source [3] is a YouTube video titled \"Orioles vs. Royals Game Highlights (4/4/25)\" which seems to be from a previous game. The transcript mentions a Royals win, but that's from April 4, not the game in question on April 6. So irrelevant.\n\n4. Source [4] from CBS Sports has a box score and summary for the April 5 game, where the Orioles won 8-1. Wait, the date here is April 5, but the query is about April 6. Hmm, maybe a typo? Wait, checking the URL, it's 20250405, which is April 5. So this is about the game on April 5, not the 6th. The user's query is about the April 6 game. So this might be a different game. Confusion here. Need to check dates carefully.\n\n5. Source [5] from Fox Sports on April 5 has another prediction for the April 6 game, predicting Orioles 4-3. But again, it's a preview, not the result.\n\n6. Source [6] is a YouTube video titled \"Orioles vs. Royals Game Highlights (4/5/25)\" which is April 5. The transcript describes an Orioles 8-1 victory, which matches the April 5 game. So this is not the April 6 game. The user's query is about April 6, so this is a previous game.\n\n7. Source [7] from ESPN shows the live score for the April 6 game, with the Orioles winning 8-1. The series is tied 1-1, indicating the April 6 game was the third in the series. The box score here confirms the Orioles won 8-1 on April 6.\n\n8. Source [8] from Action Network has odds for the April 6 game, but it's a preview. The pitchers listed are Bubic and Povich, but the result isn't here.\n\n9. Source [9] from CapperTek is another preview for the April 6 game, with betting odds but no result.\n\nSo the key sources are [1] and [7], both confirming the Orioles won 8-1 on April 6.

The user wants to consider strong market sentiment favoring the Royals. However, the actual result shows the Orioles won decisively. There might be a discrepancy here.

Need to check the dates carefully. The query is about the April 6 game. Let me check the search results again. Result [3] from ESPN is a live score for the April 6 game, but the data is unavailable. Result [5] from Action Network lists the April 6 game with starting pitchers Kris Bubic and Cade Povich. Result [9] from leans.ai also discusses the April 6 game, predicting Orioles vs. Royals. However, the most recent results [1] and [6] mention the April 5 game where Orioles won 8-1, and the April 6 game is the next day. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game on April 6. The current date is April 6, 2025, 8:30 PM UTC. The game was at 2:10 PM ET, which is 18:10 UTC. So the game would have concluded by 18:10 UTC + a few hours. The search results [1] and [6] mention the April 5 game, but the April 6 game's outcome isn't directly mentioned. However, result [1] says, \"The Royals still have a chance to win their first series of the year when they take on Baltimore again Sunday afternoon. Kris Bubic gets the start for Kansas City, with first pitch at 1:10 p.m.\" Wait, the game time in the query is 2:10 PM ET, but here it's 1:10 PM. Maybe a discrepancy in time zones or reporting. \n\nLooking at result [10] from CapperTek, the game is on April 6 at 2:10 PM ET. Result [11] from RealGM also mentions the April 6 game with a prediction. However, none of the search results explicitly state the outcome of the April 6 game. The most recent result is [1] from April 6, which talks about the April 5 game and mentions the upcoming April 6 game but doesn't provide its result. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is April 6, 8:30 PM UTC. The game would have been played earlier that day. If the search results don't include the outcome, perhaps the game hasn't been reported yet in the provided sources. However, result [1] says the Royals lost on April 5 and the next game is April 6 with Kris Bubic starting. The other results [5], [9], [10], [11] are previews or odds for the April 6 game but don't have the result. \n\nBut the user provided search results up to [11], and none explicitly state the April 6 game's outcome. However, result [6] is a YouTube video titled \"Orioles vs. Royals Game Highlights (4/5/25)\" which might be April 5, and another video [4] from April 4. The lack of April 6 results suggests that the game might have been played but not yet reported in the provided sources. \n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say to use the provided sources. If the sources don't include the April 6 game result, but the event date is in the past, and no info is available, we have to infer. However, the instructions say if no verifiable info is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. \n\nLooking at the starting pitchers for April 6: Kris Bubic for Royals and Cade Povich for Orioles (from result [5]). Bubic's stats aren't detailed here, but Povich is a rookie. The Orioles might have an edge, but without game results, it's uncertain. However, the ancillary data says if no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. But the user's instructions also say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on user prompt conditions. \n\nWait, the user's query's ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3. But if it's played and no info, perhaps the Oracle should default to p4 (cannot resolve). But the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. However, the current sources don't have the game result. \n\nBut wait, result [1] is dated April 6 and mentions the April 5 game, and says the next game is April 6 with Kris Bubic starting. Since the current time is after the game, but the provided search results don't include the outcome, perhaps the Oracle should check if any sources mention the April 6 result. Since none do, and the event is in the past, but no info is available, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). However, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the most probable outcome? The ancillary data doesn't specify, but the user prompt's resolution conditions are based on the actual outcome. Since the sources don't report the April 6 game's result, but the event date has passed, the Oracle might have to default to p4. However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But without any data, it's impossible to know. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the dates. The query is about the April 6 game, but the search results include April 5 games. Maybe the April 6 game hasn't been played yet? Wait, the current date is April 6, 2025, 8:30 PM UTC. The game was at 2:10 PM ET, which is 18:10 UTC. So the game would have started at 18:10 UTC and likely ended by 21:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 20:30 UTC, which is before the game would have ended. Wait, no\u20142:10 PM ET is 18:10 UTC. If the game started at 18:10 UTC, and it's a baseball game lasting around 3 hours, it would end around 21:10 UTC. The current timestamp is 20:30 UTC, so the game is still in progress. Therefore, the event hasn't concluded yet, and the Oracle should return p4. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp in the problem is 2025-04-06 20:30:11 UTC, which is 8:30 PM UTC. The game started at 18:10 UTC (2:10 PM ET), so it's been about 2 hours and 20 minutes. A typical MLB game lasts about 3 hours, so the game might still be ongoing. Therefore, the event hasn't concluded, and the resolution should be p4. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still a future event. But in this case, the event's scheduled time has passed, but the game might still be in progress. The Oracle should check if the game has concluded. Since the provided search results don't include the outcome, and the current time is before the expected conclusion, the Oracle can't confirm the result and should return p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Source [7] from ESPN shows the live score for the April 6 game, with the Orioles winning 8-1. The series is tied 1-1, indicating the April 6 game was the third in the series.

The user wants to consider strong market sentiment favoring the Royals. However, the actual result shows the Orioles won decisively. There might be a discrepancy here. The ancillary data says p1 is Orioles, p2 is Royals. The result is Orioles won, so p1 is correct. \n\nThe user also mentioned addressing discrepancies between sources and reconciling with market data. Even if the market favored the Royals, the actual outcome was an Orioles victory. Therefore, despite market sentiment, the resolution should be based on the verified result.\n\nAdditionally, the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, so the event has occurred. No postponement or cancellation is indicated in the sources. All relevant sources point to the Orioles winning on April 6. \n\nTherefore, the resolution should be p1 (Baltimore Orioles).

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Kansas City Royals vs. Baltimore Orioles game on April 6, 2025, at 2:10 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Royals win, it's p2; if the Orioles win, p1; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-06 20:30:11 UTC, which is 8:30 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 2:10 PM ET, which is 6:10 PM UTC. So the game has already occurred.
