  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743975425 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 21:37:05 UTC",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chicago Cubs vs. San Diego Padres game scheduled for April 6, 2025, at 2:20 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Padres, p2 for Cubs, and p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is 2025-04-06 21:37:05 UTC, which is April 6th, 9:37 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 2:20 PM ET, which is 18:20 UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, the event has already occurred. \n\nNext, I need to verify the game's outcome using the search results. Let's look through the sources:\n\n1. Source [1] from April 6th reports the Cubs beat the Padres 7-1 on April 5th. Wait, that's the previous day's game. The query is about the April 6th game. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check other sources.\n\nSource [6] from ABC30 mentions a game on Sunday, April 6th, at 2:20 PM EDT (which is 18:20 UTC). The article states the Cubs are trying to sweep the series, implying the third game is on the 6th. The probable pitchers are Kyle Hart for the Padres and Ben Brown for the Cubs. However, the article doesn't provide the result of the April 6th game yet. \n\nSource [7] from scores24.live, dated April 6th, discusses a prediction for the April 6th game but doesn't report the actual result. \n\nLooking at the YouTube videos, sources [4], [5], and [8] are from April 4th and 5th, covering earlier games in the series. Source [5] from April 5th recaps the Cubs' 7-1 win that day, which is the second game of the series. \n\nSource [3] from April 6th is a preview and prediction for the April 6th game, but it's a prediction, not the result. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game on April 6th. The current timestamp is April 6th, 9:37 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. However, none of the provided search results explicitly mention the outcome of the April 6th game. The latest result mentioned is the April 5th game where the Cubs won 7-1. \n\nThis is confusing. The ancillary data mentions the game on April 6th, but the search results don't have the result for that specific date. The user might have made a mistake in the date, or perhaps the sources haven't been updated yet. \n\nWait, looking at source [6], the article is about the April 6th game, but it's a preview, not a recap. It lists the probable pitchers and injuries but doesn't provide the score. Since the current time is after the game, but the search results don't include the outcome, I need to infer. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Cubs were on a winning streak, and the Padres had their first two losses. The prediction in source [3] favored the Cubs with a 57.27% chance. \n\nBut according to the rules, if there's no verifiable information, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions also say if the event is in the past and no info, default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the personalization says if no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome per ancillary data. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nBut in this case, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p2 for Cubs win. If the game happened and there's no report, but the Cubs were on a streak, maybe they won. However, without explicit sources, it's risky. But the user provided sources up to April 6th, but none report the April 6th game result. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date. The April 5th game was the second in the series, and the third was on April 6th. The search results don't include the April 6th result. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable info, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The Cubs were favored in the prediction (source [3]), so p2 (Cubs) would be the resolution. However, the instructions also say if the event is in the past and no info, but the user prompt doesn't specify postponement, resolve based on probable outcome. \n\nBut the problem is that the sources don't confirm the result. However, source [6] is a preview for the April 6th game, and the current date is April 6th, but the timestamp is 9:37 PM UTC, which is after the game. If the game was played and no sources report it, perhaps it's safe to assume it was played, but without info, we have to go with the probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed. But there's no info on that. The ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open. But without any sources indicating postponement, we can't assume that. \n\nTherefore, based on the lack of verifiable information but the event date being in the past, and the Cubs being on a winning streak, the resolution would be p2 (Chicago Cubs). However, strictly following the rules, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date is past, but the user prompt doesn't mention postponement, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nBut wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, can the outcome be reasonably inferred? The Cubs were on a 5-game winning streak, and the Padres had just lost two. The prediction favored the Cubs. But without explicit confirmation, it's a stretch. However, the user's instructions say to heavily bias towards provided URLs. The URLs don't have the April 6th result, so we can't confirm. Therefore, since the event date is past and no sources report the outcome, we have to default to p4 (unknown). Wait, no\u2014the instruction says if it can't be inferred, default to p4. But the ancillary data's p3 is 0.5 for canceled, but the resolution conditions are p1: Padres, p2: Cubs, p3: 50-50. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. So p3 is 50-50 if canceled. But the event wasn't canceled; it was scheduled. If there's no info, but the event occurred, and we can't verify, then according to the rules, if no info, and the event date is past, and not canceled, but outcome unknown, then p4? Wait, the personalization says: \"recommendation: p4\" if it can't be resolved. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" And p4 is for cannot be resolved. \n\nBut the resolution_conditions are p1: San Diego, p2: Cubs, p3: 50-50. So if the game was played but no info, and we can't infer, then p4. But the instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, in this case, there's no info, so we can't verify. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. \n\nBut wait, the user might have intended the April 5th game, but the query is about April 6th. The sources mention the April 5th game as a Cubs win, but the April 6th game isn't reported. Therefore, since the current date is April 6th, and the game was scheduled for today, but no results are available in the provided sources, the recommendation is p4 because the outcome isn't verifiable. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is 9:37 PM UTC on April 6th. The game was at 2:20 PM ET, which is 18:20 UTC. So the game should have concluded, but the provided search results don't include it. Therefore, without verifiable sources, the resolution is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chicago Cubs vs. San Diego Padres game on April 6, 2025. The current date is April 6, 2025, at 9:40 PM UTC, which is after the scheduled game time of 2:20 PM ET. Since the game was supposed to have already happened, I need to determine the actual result.\n\nFirst, I check the search results provided. Result [3] and [6] mention the Cubs won the game on April 5th, but that's a different date. Wait, the game in question is April 6th. Let me look for info on the April 6th game. \n\nLooking at [1], it's a prediction article from April 6th, predicting the Cubs to win. But predictions aren't actual results. [2] also from April 5th has a prediction but no result. [4] is a prediction from April 5th. [5] mentions the series schedule, with the final game on April 6th. [7] is a betting odds page from April 6th but doesn't show the result. [8] is a CBS article from April 5th detailing the Cubs' win on that day but mentions the next game on April 6th with starting pitchers Hart and Brown. \n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is April 6th, 9:40 PM UTC, which is 5:40 PM ET. The game was at 2:20 PM ET, so it should have concluded. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the April 6th game. All the results up to [8] are from before the game or predictions. The latest info in [8] is from April 5th, previewing the April 6th game but not reporting the result. \n\nSince there's no verifiable information about the April 6th game's outcome in the provided sources, I need to follow the ancillary data instructions. If the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Cubs were favored in predictions ([1], [2], [4], [7]), and they were on a winning streak. However, without confirmed results, the market should resolve to p4 (cannot be resolved). But wait, the ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Cubs were favored, so maybe p2? But the instructions say if no verifiable info, default to p4. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome... unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But the sources don't confirm the outcome. So, since the game was played but no sources report the result, we have to go with the most probable outcome. The Cubs were favored, so resolve to p2. But wait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. So despite no sources confirming, we go with the probable outcome. Therefore, recommendation: p2 (Cubs win).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check other sources.\n\nSource [6] from ABC30 mentions a game on Sunday, April 6th, at 2:20 PM EDT (which is 18:20 UTC). The article states the Cubs are trying to sweep the series, implying the third game is on the 6th. The probable pitchers are Kyle Hart for the Padres and Ben Brown for the Cubs. However, the article doesn't provide the result of the April 6th game yet. \n\nSource [7] from scores24.live, dated April 6th, discusses a prediction for the April 6th game but doesn't report the actual result. \n\nLooking at the YouTube videos, sources [4], [5], and [8] are from April 4th and 5th, covering earlier games in the series. Source [5] from April 5th recaps the Cubs' 7-1 win that day, which is the second game of the series. \n\nSource [3] from April 6th is a preview and prediction for the April 6th game, but it's a prediction, not the result. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game on April 6th. The current timestamp is April 6th, 9:37 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. However, none of the provided search results explicitly mention the outcome of the April 6th game. The latest result mentioned is the April 5th game where the Cubs won 7-1. \n\nThis is confusing. The ancillary data mentions the game on April 6th, but the search results don't have the result for that specific date. The user might have made a mistake in the date, or perhaps the sources haven't been updated yet. \n\nWait, looking at source [6], the article is about the April 6th game, but it's a preview, not a recap. It lists the probable pitchers and injuries but doesn't provide the score. Since the current time is after the game, but the search results don't include the outcome, I need to infer. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Cubs were on a winning streak, and the Padres had their first two losses. The prediction in source [3] favored the Cubs with a 57.27% chance. \n\nBut according to the rules, if there's no verifiable information, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions also say if the event is in the past and no info, default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the personalization says if no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome per ancillary data. Wait, the exact instruction: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nBut in this case, the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p2 for Cubs win. If the game happened and there's no report, but the Cubs were on a streak, maybe they won. However, without explicit sources, it's risky. But the user provided sources up to April 6th, but none report the April 6th game result. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date. The April 5th game was the second in the series, and the third was on April 6th. The search results don't include the April 6th result. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable info, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The Cubs were favored in the prediction (source [3]), so p2 (Cubs) would be the resolution. However, the instructions also say if the event is in the past and no info, but the user prompt doesn't specify postponement, resolve based on probable outcome. \n\nBut the problem is that the sources don't confirm the result. However, source [6] is a preview for the April 6th game, and the current date is April 6th, but the timestamp is 9:37 PM UTC, which is after the game. If the game was played and no sources report it, perhaps it's safe to assume it was played, but without info, we have to go with the probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was postponed. But there's no info on that. The ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open. But without any sources indicating postponement, we can't assume that. \n\nTherefore, based on the lack of verifiable information but the event date being in the past, and the Cubs being on a winning streak, the resolution would be p2 (Chicago Cubs). However, strictly following the rules, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date is past, but the user prompt doesn't mention postponement, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nBut wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, can the outcome be reasonably inferred? The Cubs were on a 5-game winning streak, and the Padres had just lost two. The prediction favored the Cubs. But without explicit confirmation, it's a stretch. However, the user's instructions say to heavily bias towards provided URLs. The URLs don't have the April 6th result, so we can't confirm. Therefore, since the event date is past and no sources report the outcome, we have to default to p4 (unknown). Wait, no\u2014the instruction says if it can't be inferred, default to p4. But the ancillary data's p3 is 0.5 for canceled, but the resolution conditions are p1: Padres, p2: Cubs, p3: 50-50. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. So p3 is 50-50 if canceled. But the event wasn't canceled; it was scheduled. If there's no info, but the event occurred, and we can't verify, then according to the rules, if no info, and the event date is past, and not canceled, but outcome unknown, then p4? Wait, the personalization says: \"recommendation: p4\" if it can't be resolved. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" And p4 is for cannot be resolved. \n\nBut the resolution_conditions are p1: San Diego, p2: Cubs, p3: 50-50. So if the game was played but no info, and we can't infer, then p4. But the instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, in this case, there's no info, so we can't verify. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. \n\nBut wait, the user might have intended the April 5th game, but the query is about April 6th. The sources mention the April 5th game as a Cubs win, but the April 6th game isn't reported. Therefore, since the current date is April 6th, and the game was scheduled for today, but no results are available in the provided sources, the recommendation is p4 because the outcome isn't verifiable. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is 9:37 PM UTC on April 6th. The game was at 2:20 PM ET, which is 18:20 UTC. So the game should have concluded, but the provided search results don't include it. Therefore, without verifiable sources, the resolution is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chicago Cubs vs. San Diego Padres game scheduled for April 6, 2025, at 2:20 PM ET.

However, the article doesn't provide the result of the April 6th game yet. \n\nSource [7] from scores24.live, dated April 6th, discusses a prediction for the April 6th game but doesn't report the actual result. \n\nLooking at the YouTube videos, sources [4], [5], and [8] are from April 4th and 5th, covering earlier games in the series. Source [5] from April 5th recaps the Cubs' 7-1 win that day, which is the second game of the series. \n\nSource [3] from April 6th is a preview and prediction for the April 6th game, but it's a prediction, not the result. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game on April 6th. The current timestamp is April 6th, 9:37 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. However, none of the provided search results explicitly mention the outcome of the April 6th game.

However, there's no conclusive evidence in the search results about the actual outcome of the April 6 game. The most recent information is from April 5th, where the Cubs won 7-1, but the user is asking about the April 6th game.\n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies the game on April 6 at 2:20 PM ET.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Chicago Cubs vs. San Diego Padres game on April 6, 2025. The key here is to verify the actual result of the game using the provided search results and ancillary data.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is 2025-04-06 21:37:05 UTC, which is after the scheduled game time of 2:20 PM ET (which would be 18:20 UTC). So the game should have already taken place.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([2], [5], [7], [14], [15]) report that the Cubs won the game on April 5th with a score of 7-1. However, the user's query is about the game on April 6th. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The ancillary data mentions the game scheduled for April 6 at 2:20 PM ET, but the search results mostly discuss the April 5th game. Let me check the dates again.\n\nLooking at result [4], it's from April 6 and mentions the Cubs trying to sweep the series against the Padres on Sunday, April 6. Result [9] also refers to the April 6 game, listing the starting pitchers as Kyle Hart for the Padres and Ben Brown for the Cubs. However, the detailed box scores and recaps in results [2], [5], [7], [14], [15] are all from April 5th. \n\nWait, result [11] shows a box score for April 6, but the data seems incomplete or placeholder (many zeros and incomplete stats). Result [12] is a preview for the April 6 game, predicting a Cubs sweep. Result [13] also lists the April 6 game with starting pitchers Hart and Brown. However, there's no conclusive evidence in the search results about the actual outcome of the April 6 game. The most recent information is from April 5th, where the Cubs won 7-1, but the user is asking about the April 6th game.\n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies the game on April 6 at 2:20 PM ET. Since the current timestamp is April 6, 2025, 21:37:05 UTC (which is 5:37 PM ET), the game should have concluded. However, the provided search results don't include a conclusive report on the April 6th game's outcome. The only April 6th content is previews or incomplete data. \n\nGiven that the user's instructions state to resolve based on verified facts and if no information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Cubs were on a winning streak, and the Padres had two losses, but without concrete data on the April 6th game, it's unclear. However, result [4] from April 6 mentions the Cubs trying to sweep, and result [12] is a preview for the April 6 game, but no actual result is provided. \n\nWait, result [11] claims to be the box score for April 6, but the data shown is incomplete and possibly placeholder. Without a reliable source confirming the outcome, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

However, the response fails to adequately consider the strong market sentiment towards the San Diego Padres, as indicated by the token prices on Polymarket. The solver's recommendation of p4 (cannot be resolved) is cautious but does not align with the market data which heavily favors the Padres. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more streamlined analysis focused directly on the event outcome rather than the extensive discussion of potential discrepancies in game dates.",
