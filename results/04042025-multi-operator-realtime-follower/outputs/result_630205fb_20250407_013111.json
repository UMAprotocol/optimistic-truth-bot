  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743989210 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-07 01:26:50 UTC",

The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is April 7, 2025. The game was scheduled for April 6, so it's already in the past. That means I need to find out if the game happened and who won. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [1] from Sportsbook Review gives a prediction that the Knicks would cover the spread and win, with a score prediction of 128-112. Result [4] from SI.com states that the Suns are in a must-win situation but mentions the Knicks are getting Jalen Brunson back. Result [8] from FOX Sports shows the game's box score, indicating the Knicks won. Result [12] on YouTube mentions the Knicks' last 10 games, including a win against the Hawks, and their previous victory over the Suns. \n\nWait, result [8] specifically has the final score. Let me check that again. The FOX Sports link [8] lists the Knicks as 49-28 and the Suns as 35-42. The leading scorers are mentioned, but the actual game result isn't explicitly stated there. Hmm, maybe I missed it. \n\nLooking at result [12], the YouTube video description says the Knicks won their previous matchup against the Suns 138-122 in November and that they were looking for their 50th win. Since the current record after the game would be 49-28, a win would make it 50-28. But the user's query is about the April 6 game. \n\nResult [9] from Stats Insider predicts a Knicks win of 117-110. Result [10] from Action Network also predicts a Knicks victory. Result [13] from OddsShark explicitly states \"New York will Win, Cover the Spread, and the Total will go Over.\" \n\nBut the most concrete evidence comes from result [8], the FOX Sports box score. Although the detailed stats are there, the final score isn't clearly listed. However, multiple sources predict a Knicks win, and given the current date is after the game, it's safe to assume the game was played. Since there's no mention of postponement or cancellation in the search results, the game likely proceeded as scheduled. \n\nTherefore, the Knicks won the game, so the resolution should be p1 (Knicks). The ancillary data maps p1 to Knicks, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Result [12] from The Score also lists the game with the Suns at 35-42 and Knicks at 49-28, but no final score. \n\nResult [5] from Wikihoops has a box score with the Knicks at 47-27 and Suns at 35-40, but the date is April 6, 2025. The comments section is empty, so no help there. \n\nResult [9] from Stats Insider predicts a Knicks win 117-110, but that's a prediction, not the actual result. Similarly, result [11] from Sportsbook Review also predicts a Knicks win but is dated before the game. \n\nResult [14] from USA Today's betting trends mentions the game as upcoming on April 6, 2025, with the Knicks as 8.5-point favorites. But again, this is pre-game analysis. \n\nWait, result [8] has a live score with the game in the first quarter, but the current date is April 7, so the game should be over. However, none of the search results provide a conclusive final score. The user instructed to use direct sources like the official NBA website or ESPN, but the provided ESPN links don't show the final score. \n\nGiven that the user's current timestamp is after the game date, and no sources in the search results confirm the outcome, I need to check if there's any mention of the result. Result [12] from The Score lists the Knicks as 49-28 and Suns as 35-42, which might indicate the Knicks won, increasing their record to 49-28, but without explicit confirmation. \n\nSince the user's instructions say if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Knicks were favored, had a better record, and the Suns were on a losing streak with Durant out. The most probable outcome is a Knicks win.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743989210 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-07 01:26:50 UTC",
