  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743973510 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 21:05:10 UTC",

The current date is April 6, 2025, and the timestamp is 9:08 PM UTC, which is 5:08 PM ET. Wait, the game was supposed to be at 7:00 PM ET. Wait, the current time is 21:05 UTC on April 6, which converts to 5:05 PM ET. So the game is scheduled for 7:00 PM ET, which is 23:00 UTC.

The game is scheduled for 7:10 PM ET (as per search result 4), which is 23:10 UTC. So the game is in the future relative to the current time. Therefore, according to the personalization instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the user's query says the market resolves based on the game's outcome, and if postponed, it remains open. But the current time is before the game's scheduled time. However, looking at the search results, there's a lot about the Saturday game being postponed to Sunday as part of a doubleheader. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the user's query is about the game on April 6 at 7:00 PM ET. The search results mention that the Saturday game (April 5) was postponed and rescheduled as part of a split doubleheader on Sunday, April 6.

Therefore, the event hasn't happened yet, so the market can't be resolved yet. Hence, the recommendation should be p4.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Boston Red Sox vs. St. Louis Cardinals game scheduled for April 6, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Cardinals, p2 for Red Sox, p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is April 6, 2025, and the timestamp is 9:08 PM UTC, which is 5:08 PM ET. Wait, the game was supposed to be at 7:00 PM ET. Wait, the current time is 21:05 UTC on April 6, which converts to 5:05 PM ET. So the game is scheduled for 7:00 PM ET, which is 23:00 UTC. But the current timestamp is 21:05 UTC, so the game hasn't started yet. Wait, no, the user's current timestamp is 2025-04-06 21:05:10 UTC, which is 5:05 PM ET. The game is scheduled for 7:10 PM ET (as per search result 4), which is 23:10 UTC. So the game is in the future relative to the current time. Therefore, according to the personalization instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the user's query says the market resolves based on the game's outcome, and if postponed, it remains open. But the current time is before the game's scheduled time. However, looking at the search results, there's a lot about the Saturday game being postponed to Sunday as part of a doubleheader. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the user's query is about the game on April 6 at 7:00 PM ET. The search results mention that the Saturday game (April 5) was postponed and rescheduled as part of a split doubleheader on Sunday, April 6. The first game is at 1:35 PM ET, and the second game (originally scheduled for Sunday night) remains at 7:10 PM ET. So the user is asking about the Sunday night game, which is Game 2. However, the current timestamp is April 6, 2025, 21:05:10 UTC, which is 5:05 PM ET. The second game is at 7:10 PM ET, so it's in the future. Therefore, the event hasn't occurred yet. According to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, the recommendation is p4. But wait, the user's ancillary data says if the game is postponed, the market remains open. However, the game in question (April 6, 7:10 PM ET) hasn't been postponed; it's still scheduled. The Saturday game was postponed to Sunday afternoon. So the Sunday night game is still on. But the current time is before the game's start time. Therefore, the event hasn't happened yet, so the market can't be resolved yet. Hence, the recommendation should be p4. But I need to confirm if there's any information about the Sunday night game being postponed. Checking the search results, result 15 says the Saturday game was postponed to Sunday as a split doubleheader, with the first game at 1:35 PM and the second at 7:10 PM. Result 18 also confirms the doubleheader on Sunday. Result 19 mentions the second game is still scheduled for 7:10 PM. So the Sunday night game is still on. Since the current time is before the game's start, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the rules, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
