  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743979883 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 22:51:23 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the San Francisco Giants vs. Seattle Mariners game scheduled for April 6, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Giants win, it's p2; if the Mariners win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The timestamp given is 2025-04-06 22:51:23 UTC, which is 10:51 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, which is 8:05 PM UTC. So the game should have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources. Results [1], [4], [9], and [10] discuss the game on April 5th where the Giants won 4-1. However, the query is about the April 6th game. \n\nSearch result [11] from Oddsshark lists the April 6th game with starting pitchers Bryan Woo for the Mariners and Jordan Hicks for the Giants. The game time is 4:05 PM EDT. There's no direct mention of the outcome here. \n\nOther search results like [3], [6], [7], [8] discuss previous games or other postponed games (like Marlins-Braves in [5]), but not the specific April 6th game. \n\nSince the current timestamp is after the scheduled game time, I need to check if there's any report of the game's outcome. The provided search results don't include any articles or videos about the April 6th game's result. The latest mentions are from April 5th. \n\nGiven that there's no information about a postponement or cancellation (the Marlins-Braves game in [5] was postponed, but that's a different game), and the game date is in the past, but no sources report the outcome, I have to follow the ancillary data. If the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, but the user prompt doesn't mention postponement or cancellation, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the resolution conditions state that if the game is canceled, it's p3. Since there's no info on cancellation, but the game was scheduled and no result is found, perhaps it's a case where the game was played but not reported in the provided sources. Alternatively, maybe it was postponed but not mentioned. \n\nWait, the user provided search results up to [11], and none mention the April 6th game's result. However, the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open. Since the current time is after the game, but no result is found, and there's no report of postponement, perhaps the game was played. But without sources confirming the outcome, how to proceed? \n\nThe personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome per the user prompt's conditions. The user prompt's ancillary data doesn't specify a default, but the resolution_conditions have p3 as 50-50 only if canceled. Since there's no info on cancellation, and the game was scheduled, but no result is found, perhaps the market can't be resolved and should remain open (but the instructions say if postponed, market remains open; if canceled, p3). However, the timestamp is after the game, so if it was played and no result is available, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no info. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the lack of reports is an oversight. But according to the provided sources, the latest Giants-Mariners game covered is April 5th. The April 6th game isn't mentioned in any of the search results. Therefore, it's possible the game was postponed. However, the Marlins-Braves game was postponed, but that's a different series. There's no mention of Giants-Mariners being postponed. \n\nWait, search result [5] mentions the Marlins-Braves game on April 6th was postponed, but nothing about Giants-Mariners. The user's query is about Giants-Mariners. Since there's no info on postponement or cancellation for that specific game, and the current time is past the scheduled time, but no results, perhaps the game was played but not covered in the provided sources. However, the instructions say to use only the provided search results. Since the search results don't include the outcome, but the event date is in the past, and the user prompt says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p1 for Mariners, p2 for Giants. Without any info, maybe the default is p4 (cannot resolve), but the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, the conditions don't specify a default. Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nSo, in this case, the ancillary data's conditions don't have a default except for cancellation. Since the game wasn't canceled (no sources say so), and assuming it was played, but no result is available, perhaps the resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut without any sources, how to determine the probable outcome? The starting pitchers were Bryan Woo (1-0, 1.50 ERA) vs. Jordan Hicks (1-0, 5.06 ERA) according to [1]. Maybe the Mariners had a better chance, but that's speculative. However, the instructions say to base it on the conditions in the user prompt. The user prompt's ancillary data doesn't provide a default beyond the win/loss/postponement/cancellation. \n\nGiven the lack of information, and the requirement to resolve, perhaps the correct answer is p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). But wait, the event date is in the past, so according to the instructions, if it's in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the Giants won, continuing their streak, but that's an assumption. However, the provided sources don't mention the April 6th game's result. \n\nTherefore, since there's no verifiable information in the provided search results about the April 6th game's outcome, and the event date is in the past, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a default for this scenario (only for cancellation), the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve now). However, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since there are no sources contradicting, but also none confirming, perhaps the resolution is p4. \n\nWait, the personalization also states: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past, but there's no verifiable info. The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't specify a default for an unverified outcome, only for cancellation. Therefore, since the game wasn't canceled (no sources say so), and assuming it was played but no result is available, the resolution should be p4. However, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible to determine. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports indicates it wasn't postponed. But without knowing the result, the market can't be resolved. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the San Francisco Giants vs. Seattle Mariners game scheduled for April 6, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Giants win, it's p2; if the Mariners win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The timestamp given is 2025-04-06 22:51:23 UTC, which is 10:51 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, which is 8:05 PM UTC. So the game should have already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources. Results [1], [4], [9], and [10] discuss the game on April 5th where the Giants won 4-1. However, the query is about the April 6th game. \n\nSearch result [11] from Oddsshark lists the April 6th game with starting pitchers Bryan Woo for the Mariners and Jordan Hicks for the Giants. The game time is 4:05 PM EDT. There's no direct mention of the outcome here. \n\nOther search results like [3], [6], [7], [8] discuss previous games or other postponed games (like Marlins-Braves in [5]), but not the specific April 6th game. \n\nSince the current timestamp is after the scheduled game time, I need to check if there's any report of the game's outcome. The provided search results don't include any articles or videos about the April 6th game's result. The latest mentions are from April 5th. \n\nGiven that there's no information about a postponement or cancellation (the Marlins-Braves game in [5] was postponed, but that's a different game), and the game date is in the past, but no sources report the outcome, I have to follow the ancillary data. If the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, but the user prompt doesn't mention postponement or cancellation, we assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the resolution conditions state that if the game is canceled, it's p3. Since there's no info on cancellation, but the game was scheduled and no result is found, perhaps it's a case where the game was played but not reported in the provided sources. Alternatively, maybe it was postponed but not mentioned. \n\nWait, the user provided search results up to [11], and none mention the April 6th game's result. However, the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open. Since the current time is after the game, but no result is found, and there's no report of postponement, perhaps the game was played. But without sources confirming the outcome, how to proceed? \n\nThe personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome per the user prompt's conditions. The user prompt's ancillary data doesn't specify a default, but the resolution_conditions have p3 as 50-50 only if canceled. Since there's no info on cancellation, and the game was scheduled, but no result is found, perhaps the market can't be resolved and should remain open (but the instructions say if postponed, market remains open; if canceled, p3). However, the timestamp is after the game, so if it was played and no result is available, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no info. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the game was played, and the lack of reports is an oversight. But according to the provided sources, the latest Giants-Mariners game covered is April 5th. The April 6th game isn't mentioned in any of the search results. Therefore, it's possible the game was postponed. However, the Marlins-Braves game was postponed, but that's a different series. There's no mention of Giants-Mariners being postponed. \n\nWait, search result [5] mentions the Marlins-Braves game on April 6th was postponed, but nothing about Giants-Mariners. The user's query is about Giants-Mariners. Since there's no info on postponement or cancellation for that specific game, and the current time is past the scheduled time, but no results, perhaps the game was played but not covered in the provided sources. However, the instructions say to use only the provided search results. Since the search results don't include the outcome, but the event date is in the past, and the user prompt says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p1 for Mariners, p2 for Giants. Without any info, maybe the default is p4 (cannot resolve), but the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, the conditions don't specify a default. Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nSo, in this case, the ancillary data's conditions don't have a default except for cancellation. Since the game wasn't canceled (no sources say so), and assuming it was played, but no result is available, perhaps the resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut without any sources, how to determine the probable outcome? The starting pitchers were Bryan Woo (1-0, 1.50 ERA) vs. Jordan Hicks (1-0, 5.06 ERA) according to [1]. Maybe the Mariners had a better chance, but that's speculative. However, the instructions say to base it on the conditions in the user prompt. The user prompt's ancillary data doesn't provide a default beyond the win/loss/postponement/cancellation. \n\nGiven the lack of information, and the requirement to resolve, perhaps the correct answer is p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). But wait, the event date is in the past, so according to the instructions, if it's in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Alternatively, maybe the game was played, and the Giants won, continuing their streak, but that's an assumption. However, the provided sources don't mention the April 6th game's result. \n\nTherefore, since there's no verifiable information in the provided search results about the April 6th game's outcome, and the event date is in the past, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a default for this scenario (only for cancellation), the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve now). However, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since there are no sources contradicting, but also none confirming, perhaps the resolution is p4. \n\nWait, the personalization also states: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nIn this case, the event date is in the past, but there's no verifiable info. The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't specify a default for an unverified outcome, only for cancellation. Therefore, since the game wasn't canceled (no sources say so), and assuming it was played but no result is available, the resolution should be p4. However, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible to determine. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the lack of reports indicates it wasn't postponed. But without knowing the result, the market can't be resolved. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
