  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743994521 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-07 02:55:21 UTC",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the NBA game between the Houston Rockets and the Golden State Warriors scheduled for April 6 at 8:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on the game's outcome, with specific conditions for wins, postponement, or cancellation.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The timestamp given is 2025-04-07 02:55:21 UTC, which is April 7th, 2025, at 2:55 AM UTC. The game was supposed to happen on April 6th at 8:30 PM ET. Converting that to UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 8:30 PM ET would be 00:30 AM UTC on April 7th. The current time is 02:55 AM UTC on April 7th, so the game should have already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome of the game. The user provided search results, but looking at them, there's no specific information about the game's result. The sources mention general NBA news, player injuries, and team strategies, but nothing about the actual result of the April 6th game. Without verified sources confirming the winner, I can't definitively say if the Rockets or Warriors won.\n\nSince the event date is in the past and there's no information on postponement or cancellation, the ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Rockets have a better record (45-30) compared to the Warriors (40-35), and they're playing at home. However, the Warriors have key players like Curry and Thompson. But without concrete evidence, it's risky to assume. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the game is canceled, it resolves 50-50 (p3). If postponed, the market stays open. Since there's no info on postponement or cancellation, and the game date has passed, but no result is available, the safest recommendation is p4, indicating insufficient information. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any sources, even that's a guess. Wait, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions here are the teams' records and home advantage. So maybe p2 (Rockets) is the recommendation. But I'm conflicted because there's no actual source confirming the result. The user's personalization says if no info, assume the most probable. So Rockets winning is more probable, hence p2. But I need to check if the user provided any URLs. The user didn't include any specific URLs, so I can't rely on external sources. Therefore, based on the ancillary data and the conditions, the recommendation would be p2. But wait, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. So even without sources, we have to pick based on the given conditions. Therefore, the recommendation is p2: Rockets.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",
