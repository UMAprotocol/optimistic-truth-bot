  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743985344 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-07 00:22:24 UTC",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the NHL game between the Florida Panthers and Detroit Red Wings on April 6, 2025, at 5:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Red Wings, p2 for Panthers, and p3 if canceled. The current date is April 7, 2025, so the game should have already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game was set for April 6 at Little Caesars Arena. Results [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7] all reference the game date as April 6, 2025. Since the current date is April 7, the game is in the past. No sources mention postponement or cancellation, so it's safe to assume the game was played.\n\nNext, determine the outcome. The search results provide predictions and some post-game info. Result [7] from the Panthers' official site states they lost 3-0 to the Senators on April 5 and were looking to pick up points in Detroit on April 6. However, the preview doesn't give the final score. Other sources like [1], [2], [5], [6] are predictions made before the game. For example, [5] predicts a Red Wings win 4-2, while [1] gives Panthers a 53% chance. But these are pre-game analyses.\n\nWait, result [7] mentions the Panthers' loss on April 5 and their upcoming game against Detroit. It also notes that in their previous meeting on Jan 16, Detroit won 5-2. However, the key info is missing here. Since all the search results are pre-game, I might need to infer based on the most recent data. But the user provided search results up to [14], which include some post-game info in [7] but not the final score. \n\nWait, looking again at [7], it's a preview article from the Panthers' site dated April 6, 2025. It says, \"Owning a 44-28-4 record, the injury-plagued Panthers were held without a goal in the first half of their back-to-back, suffering a 3-0 loss...\" That refers to their game on April 5. The article is a preview for the April 6 game, so it doesn't include the result. The other sources are all predictions, not actual results. \n\nSince the user's provided search results don't include post-game reports, I have to rely on the ancillary data. The resolution conditions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions in the sources are mixed: some favor Panthers (53% in [1]), others Red Wings ([2], [5], [6]). However, the Panthers were injury-plagued, missing key players like Barkov and Tkachuk, and on a back-to-back. The Red Wings had rest and home advantage. \n\nGiven the absence of confirmed results, but considering the conditions, the most probable outcome based on the pre-game analysis leaning towards Red Wings (as per [5] and [2]) would be a Red Wings win. Therefore, the resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
