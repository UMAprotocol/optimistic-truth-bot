  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743959760 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 17:16:00 UTC",

The current date is April 6, 2025, so the game should have already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results include articles from April 3 and 4 predicting the game, but no post-game reports. That's odd. Maybe the game was postponed or canceled? Let me check the sources again. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no direct mention of the game's outcome. The latest info is from April 4, which is the day of the game. The user provided ancillary data stating that if the game is postponed, the market remains open, and if canceled, resolves to p3. Since the current date is April 6, two days after the scheduled game, but there's no info on the outcome, I need to consider possible reasons. \n\nSearch result [9] discusses MLB rain delay rules. If the game was postponed, it might have been rescheduled. But without any sources confirming the outcome, I can't assume it was played. The user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions in the sources (like [1], [2], [5], [6]) mostly favor the Athletics, but some suggest Rockies might win. However, without verification, relying on predictions isn't enough. \n\nSince the game was supposed to happen on April 4 and there's no confirmation of it being played, postponed, or canceled, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data if canceled. But the user's instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any sources confirming the actual result, it's unclear. The market should resolve based on verifiable facts. Since there's no verifiable outcome, and the game date has passed, but no cancellation info, maybe it's considered canceled? But the user's rules say if canceled, resolve to p3. However, without explicit confirmation of cancellation, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was played but not reported in the sources, maybe the Athletics won as the favorite. But without evidence, that's speculation. The user's instructions require relying on provided sources. Since none of the sources confirm the outcome, and the game date is past, the correct resolution is p3 (canceled) as per the ancillary data. But wait, the ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3. If the game was postponed, the market stays open. But since it's two days later, and no info, maybe it's considered canceled. However, MLB games are usually rescheduled. Without confirmation, it's ambiguous. \n\nGiven the strict rules, if there's no verifiable info, and the event date is past, the resolution should be p3. But the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions suggest Athletics were favorites, so p1. But this is conflicting. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So, since the game date is past, and no sources contradict, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions in the sources indicate Athletics were favorites, so p1. But some sources also mention Rockies might win. However, the majority lean towards Athletics. Therefore, the resolution should be p1. But I need to check if any sources confirm the actual result. Since none do, but the date is past, per instructions, assume the most probable outcome.

However, without verification, relying on predictions isn't enough. \n\nSince the game was supposed to happen on April 4 and there's no confirmation of it being played, postponed, or canceled, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data if canceled. But the user's instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any sources confirming the actual result, it's unclear.

But the user's rules say if canceled, resolve to p3. However, without explicit confirmation of cancellation, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was played but not reported in the sources, maybe the Athletics won as the favorite.

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Colorado Rockies vs. Athletics game scheduled for April 4, 2025, at 4:10 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the Rockies won, the Athletics won, if the game was postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to determine the actual outcome of the game. Let's look through the sources. \n\nLooking at result [1], it mentions the Athletics beat the Rockies 7-4 on April 6. Wait, that's the date of the current query, but the game in question was on April 4. Hmm, maybe there were multiple games in the series. Let me check other sources.\n\nResult [2] is a box score for the April 4 game. It shows the Athletics won 6-3 in 11 innings. The box score details indicate the Athletics scored 3 runs in the 11th inning. That seems conclusive. \n\nResult [4] also refers to the April 4 game, confirming the Athletics won 6-3 in 11 innings. The highlights in [6] and the box score in [5] support this outcome. \n\nAdditionally, result [3] discusses the Athletics' offense in Colorado, mentioning their win on April 5 (7-4), but the April 4 game is clearly covered in other sources. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the search results. The Rockies' record is mentioned as 1-7 after the April 6 game, which aligns with them losing the series. \n\nSince all evidence points to the Athletics winning the April 4 game, the market should resolve to p1 (Athletics). The user's ancillary data specifies p1 for Athletics, p2 for Rockies, and p3 for canceled. Since the game was played and completed, with a clear winner, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Colorado Rockies vs. Athletics game scheduled for April 4, 2025, at 4:10 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the Rockies won, the Athletics won, if the game was postponed, or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to determine the actual outcome of the game. Let's look through the sources. \n\nLooking at result [1], it mentions the Athletics beat the Rockies 7-4 on April 6. Wait, that's the date of the current query, but the game in question was on April 4. Hmm, maybe there were multiple games in the series. Let me check other sources.\n\nResult [2] is a box score for the April 4 game. It shows the Athletics won 6-3 in 11 innings. The box score details indicate the Athletics scored 3 runs in the 11th inning. That seems conclusive. \n\nResult [4] also refers to the April 4 game, confirming the Athletics won 6-3 in 11 innings. The highlights in [6] and the box score in [5] support this outcome. \n\nAdditionally, result [3] discusses the Athletics' offense in Colorado, mentioning their win on April 5 (7-4), but the April 4 game is clearly covered in other sources. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the search results. The Rockies' record is mentioned as 1-7 after the April 6 game, which aligns with them losing the series. \n\nSince all evidence points to the Athletics winning the April 4 game, the market should resolve to p1 (Athletics). The user's ancillary data specifies p1 for Athletics, p2 for Rockies, and p3 for canceled. Since the game was played and completed, with a clear winner, the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743959760 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 17:16:00 UTC"
