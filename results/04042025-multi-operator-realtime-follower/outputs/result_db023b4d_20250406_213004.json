  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743974776 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 21:26:16 UTC",

However, none of the provided search results include the outcome of the April 6 game. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the April 6 game.

The ancillary data says if postponed, wait; if canceled, 50-50. Since the game wasn't postponed or canceled, but there's no result in the sources, I need to infer. \n\nThe Rangers were on a 4-game win streak, and the Rays had lost 3 in a row. The starting pitchers for April 6 were Drew Rasmussen for the Rays and Kumar Rocker for the Rangers. Rasmussen had a strong previous start, while Rocker struggled. However, the Rangers' bullpen was performing well. \n\nBut without explicit confirmation from the sources, I can't definitively state the outcome. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Rangers win.

The ancillary data specifies that if the Rangers win, it's p2; if the Rays win, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is April 6, 2025, 9:29 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. The search results provided are from April 6, 2025, and mention the game on April 5 (Saturday) and the upcoming game on April 6 (Sunday). Wait, the user's query is about the April 6 game, but the search results [1][2][3][5] discuss the April 5 game where the Rangers won 6-4. The April 6 game is the series finale, with probable starters Drew Rasmussen for the Rays and Kumar Rocker for the Rangers. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no direct mention of the April 6 game's outcome. The latest info in the results is from before the game. However, the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. Since the user provided search results up to April 6 but no actual result for that day's game, I need to check if there's any info in the provided context. \n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say to use the provided URLs heavily if specified. The user included URLs, so I must rely on them. The search results [4][6][8] mention the April 6 game but don't report the result. Since the current date is April 6, 2025, 9:29 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (2:35 PM ET, which is 18:35 UTC), the game should have concluded. However, none of the provided search results include the outcome of the April 6 game. \n\nThe user's additional instruction says to verify the outcome using reliable sources and default to p4 if no info. But according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Rays win, p2 as Rangers. If no info, but the event date has passed, and no sources report the outcome, perhaps it's unresolved. However, the market resolution conditions don't have a p4; the user's personalization mentions p4, but the ancillary data only has p1, p2, p3. Wait, the user's personalization says to end with recommendation p1-p4, but the ancillary data's resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. This might be a conflict. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" But the ancillary data's resolution_conditions are p1: Rays, p2: Rangers, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization also mentions p4 for unresolved future events. Since the game was scheduled for April 6, which is today, but the current time is after the game's scheduled time, and the provided search results don't include the outcome, perhaps the event is considered past but with no data. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nIn this case, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't have a p4. The user's personalization mentions p4 for future events. Since the game date is in the past (April 6, 2025), but no outcome is found in the provided sources, we have to infer. However, the provided search results don't include the April 6 game's result. The latest info is from April 5. Therefore, there's no verifiable data. According to the instructions, if no info, default to p4. But the ancillary data doesn't have p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut without any sources, how to determine the most probable outcome? The ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't provide probabilities, just mappings. The user's query might have a mistake in the ancillary data's p1 and p2 labels. Wait, the ancillary_data says: \"res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Tampa Bay Rays, p2 to Texas Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\" So p1 is Rays win, p2 is Rangers win. \n\nSince the event date is in the past, and no sources report the outcome, but the user's instruction says to default to p4 if no data. However, the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut without any data, how to infer? The user might have intended to ask about the April 5 game, but the query is about April 6. Alternatively, maybe there's confusion in dates. The search results [1][2][3][5] discuss the April 5 game (Saturday), which the Rangers won. The April 6 game (Sunday) is the one in question. Since the provided search results don't include the outcome of the April 6 game, and the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, but no data is available, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve to p4. However, the ancillary data doesn't have p4. The user's personalization says to end with p1-p4, but the resolution_conditions only have p1-p3. \n\nThis is conflicting. The user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the event is in the past. Since the event is in the past and no info is available, but the user's instruction says to default to p4 due to lack of data, but the resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the query date. The search results mention the April 5 game, which the Rangers won, but the query is about April 6. If the user intended to ask about the April 5 game, the answer would be p2. But the query is about April 6. Since no data is available for April 6, and the event date is in the past, but no sources report it, the resolution would be p3 (canceled) or p4 (unresolved). However, the ancillary data's p3 is for canceled games. Since there's no info on cancellation, but the game was scheduled, and no result is found, perhaps it's considered unresolved, but the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the April 6 game was played, but the provided search results don't include it. Since the user provided search results up to [8], which mentions the April 6 game as upcoming, but no result, and the current date is after the game, but no sources are provided that report the outcome, the resolution would be p4. However, the ancillary data doesn't have p4. This is a conflict. \n\nGiven the confusion, but following the user's personalization which says to end with p4 if no data, even though the ancillary data doesn't include it, I think the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut without any sources, how to determine the probable outcome? The ancillary data doesn't provide probabilities. The market resolution is binary: Rangers or Rays. If no info, perhaps it's p3 (50-50), but the user's personalization says to default to p4. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. The correct approach is to check if the game was played. Since the current date is after the scheduled time, and the game wasn't reported as postponed or canceled, it's likely the game was played. However, without any sources, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, according to the user's instruction, if no verifiable data, default to p4. But the ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't have p4. The user's personalization says to return p4 regardless. \n\nTherefore, despite the conflict, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

According to the instructions, if no info, default to p4. But the ancillary data doesn't have p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut without any sources, how to determine the most probable outcome? The ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't provide probabilities, just mappings. The user's query might have a mistake in the ancillary data's p1 and p2 labels. Wait, the ancillary_data says: \"res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Tampa Bay Rays, p2 to Texas Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\" So p1 is Rays win, p2 is Rangers win. \n\nSince the event date is in the past, and no sources report the outcome, but the user's instruction says to default to p4 if no data. However, the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut without any data, how to infer? The user might have intended to ask about the April 5 game, but the query is about April 6. Alternatively, maybe there's confusion in dates. The search results [1][2][3][5] discuss the April 5 game (Saturday), which the Rangers won. The April 6 game (Sunday) is the one in question. Since the provided search results don't include the outcome of the April 6 game, and the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, but no data is available, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve to p4. However, the ancillary data doesn't have p4. The user's personalization says to end with p1-p4, but the resolution_conditions only have p1-p3. \n\nThis is conflicting. The user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the event is in the past. Since the event is in the past and no info is available, but the user's instruction says to default to p4 due to lack of data, but the resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the query date. The search results mention the April 5 game, which the Rangers won, but the query is about April 6. If the user intended to ask about the April 5 game, the answer would be p2. But the query is about April 6. Since no data is available for April 6, and the event date is in the past, but no sources report it, the resolution would be p3 (canceled) or p4 (unresolved). However, the ancillary data's p3 is for canceled games. Since there's no info on cancellation, but the game was scheduled, and no result is found, perhaps it's considered unresolved, but the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the April 6 game was played, but the provided search results don't include it. Since the user provided search results up to [8], which mentions the April 6 game as upcoming, but no result, and the current date is after the game, but no sources are provided that report the outcome, the resolution would be p4. However, the ancillary data doesn't have p4. This is a conflict. \n\nGiven the confusion, but following the user's personalization which says to end with p4 if no data, even though the ancillary data doesn't include it, I think the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut without any sources, how to determine the probable outcome? The ancillary data doesn't provide probabilities. The market resolution is binary: Rangers or Rays. If no info, perhaps it's p3 (50-50), but the user's personalization says to default to p4. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. The correct approach is to check if the game was played. Since the current date is after the scheduled time, and the game wasn't reported as postponed or canceled, it's likely the game was played. However, without any sources, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, according to the user's instruction, if no verifiable data, default to p4. But the ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't have p4. The user's personalization says to return p4 regardless. \n\nTherefore, despite the conflict, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Since the game wasn't postponed or canceled, but there's no result in the sources, I need to infer. \n\nThe Rangers were on a 4-game win streak, and the Rays had lost 3 in a row. The starting pitchers for April 6 were Drew Rasmussen for the Rays and Kumar Rocker for the Rangers. Rasmussen had a strong previous start, while Rocker struggled.

The April 6 game is the series finale, with probable starters Drew Rasmussen for the Rays and Kumar Rocker for the Rangers. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no direct mention of the April 6 game's outcome. The latest info in the results is from before the game. However, the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time. Since the user provided search results up to April 6 but no actual result for that day's game, I need to check if there's any info in the provided context. \n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions say to use the provided URLs heavily if specified. The user included URLs, so I must rely on them. The search results [4][6][8] mention the April 6 game but don't report the result. Since the current date is April 6, 2025, 9:29 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (2:35 PM ET, which is 18:35 UTC), the game should have concluded. However, none of the provided search results include the outcome of the April 6 game. \n\nThe user's additional instruction says to verify the outcome using reliable sources and default to p4 if no info. But according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Rays win, p2 as Rangers. If no info, but the event date has passed, and no sources report the outcome, perhaps it's unresolved. However, the market resolution conditions don't have a p4; the user's personalization mentions p4, but the ancillary data only has p1, p2, p3. Wait, the user's personalization says to end with recommendation p1-p4, but the ancillary data's resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. This might be a conflict. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" But the ancillary data's resolution_conditions are p1: Rays, p2: Rangers, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization also mentions p4 for unresolved future events. Since the game was scheduled for April 6, which is today, but the current time is after the game's scheduled time, and the provided search results don't include the outcome, perhaps the event is considered past but with no data. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nIn this case, the ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't have a p4. The user's personalization mentions p4 for future events. Since the game date is in the past (April 6, 2025), but no outcome is found in the provided sources, we have to infer. However, the provided search results don't include the April 6 game's result. The latest info is from April 5. Therefore, there's no verifiable data. According to the instructions, if no info, default to p4. But the ancillary data doesn't have p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut without any sources, how to determine the most probable outcome? The ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't provide probabilities, just mappings. The user's query might have a mistake in the ancillary data's p1 and p2 labels. Wait, the ancillary_data says: \"res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Tampa Bay Rays, p2 to Texas Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\" So p1 is Rays win, p2 is Rangers win. \n\nSince the event date is in the past, and no sources report the outcome, but the user's instruction says to default to p4 if no data. However, the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut without any data, how to infer? The user might have intended to ask about the April 5 game, but the query is about April 6. Alternatively, maybe there's confusion in dates. The search results [1][2][3][5] discuss the April 5 game (Saturday), which the Rangers won. The April 6 game (Sunday) is the one in question. Since the provided search results don't include the outcome of the April 6 game, and the current timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, but no data is available, according to the instructions, if no verifiable info, resolve to p4. However, the ancillary data doesn't have p4. The user's personalization says to end with p1-p4, but the resolution_conditions only have p1-p3. \n\nThis is conflicting. The user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the event is in the past. Since the event is in the past and no info is available, but the user's instruction says to default to p4 due to lack of data, but the resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the query date. The search results mention the April 5 game, which the Rangers won, but the query is about April 6. If the user intended to ask about the April 5 game, the answer would be p2. But the query is about April 6. Since no data is available for April 6, and the event date is in the past, but no sources report it, the resolution would be p3 (canceled) or p4 (unresolved). However, the ancillary data's p3 is for canceled games. Since there's no info on cancellation, but the game was scheduled, and no result is found, perhaps it's considered unresolved, but the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the April 6 game was played, but the provided search results don't include it. Since the user provided search results up to [8], which mentions the April 6 game as upcoming, but no result, and the current date is after the game, but no sources are provided that report the outcome, the resolution would be p4. However, the ancillary data doesn't have p4. This is a conflict. \n\nGiven the confusion, but following the user's personalization which says to end with p4 if no data, even though the ancillary data doesn't include it, I think the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut without any sources, how to determine the probable outcome? The ancillary data doesn't provide probabilities. The market resolution is binary: Rangers or Rays. If no info, perhaps it's p3 (50-50), but the user's personalization says to default to p4. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. The correct approach is to check if the game was played. Since the current date is after the scheduled time, and the game wasn't reported as postponed or canceled, it's likely the game was played. However, without any sources, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, according to the user's instruction, if no verifiable data, default to p4. But the ancillary data's resolution_conditions don't have p4. The user's personalization says to return p4 regardless. \n\nTherefore, despite the conflict, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",
