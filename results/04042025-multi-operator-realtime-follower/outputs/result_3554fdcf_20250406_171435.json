  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743959520 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 17:12:00 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Pipeline\" between March 28, 5:00 PM ET and April 4, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements don't count.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any mentions of Trump saying \"Pipeline\" during that timeframe. Let's go through each source one by one.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Source [1]**: From January 22, 2025. Trump discusses oil and gas production, mentions pipelines. But this is way before the March 28-April 4 window. So no.\n\n2. **Source [2]**: February 25, 2025. Trump talks about the Keystone XL pipeline. Again, outside the timeframe.\n\n3. **Source [3]**: February 18, 2025. Mentions the Constitution Pipeline. Still before March 28.\n\n4. **Source [4]**: A PDF from March 2024. Not relevant here.\n\n5. **Source [5]**: March 13, 2025. Video about a meeting with Gov. Hochul discussing a natural gas pipeline. The transcript snippet doesn't include the word \"pipeline\" in the quoted part. Wait, the user's query is about the exact term \"Pipeline\". The transcript shows Trump says \"natural gas pipeline\". But the exact date is March 13, which is before March 28. So outside the window.\n\n6. **Source [6]**: From 2022. Not relevant.\n\n7. **Source [7]**: March 26, 2025. Executive order on mineral production. No mention of pipelines.\n\n8. **Source [8]**: February 25, 2025. Again, Keystone XL, but outside the timeframe.\n\n9. **Source [9]**: March 5, 2025. Trump's speech mentions a natural pipeline in Alaska. The exact quote is \"large natural pipeline\". The date is March 4, 2025, according to the source. Wait, the user's timeframe starts March 28. So this is too early.\n\n10. **Source [10]**: March 4, 2025. Congress speech. The transcript mentions \"mineral resources deal\" but no \"pipeline\".\n\n11. **Source [11]**: March 4, 2025. Trump's address where he says \"Drill, baby, drill\" but no mention of \"pipeline\".\n\n12. **Source [12]**: January 24, 2025. About Keystone XL, outside the window.\n\n13. **Source [13]**: April 2, 2025. \"Liberation Day\" speech. The transcript provided doesn't include the word \"pipeline\". He talks about tariffs and industry, but no direct mention.\n\n14. **Source [14]**: April 2, 2025. Tariffs on vehicles. No mention of pipeline.\n\n15. **Source [15]**: April 2, 2025. Tariffs again, no pipeline.\n\n16. **Source [16]**: April 6, 2025. Analysis of tariffs, no mention of Trump saying \"pipeline\".\n\n17. **Source [17]**: April 2, 2025. Pharma tariffs, no pipeline.\n\nSo, all the sources that mention pipelines are outside the March 28-April 4 window. The closest is the March 13 meeting (source [5]), but that's still before March 28. The user's timeframe starts on March 28, so any mentions before that don't count. \n\nI need to check if there are any other events between March 28 and April 4 where Trump might have mentioned \"pipeline\". The provided search results don't include any events in that specific window. The latest relevant sources are from April 2 and 6, but those don't mention \"pipeline\" verbally. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, there's no evidence that Trump verbally mentioned \"pipeline\" between March 28 and April 4, 2025. The answer should be \"No\", which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
