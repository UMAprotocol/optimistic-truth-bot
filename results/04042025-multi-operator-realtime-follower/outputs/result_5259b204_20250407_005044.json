  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743986786 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-07 00:46:26 UTC",

The resolution depends on who wins the game. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p2; if the Cavaliers win, p1; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current timestamp is April 7, 2025, 00:46:26 UTC, which is April 6 in Eastern Time. The game was scheduled for 6:00 PM ET on April 6, so it should have concluded by now. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game's outcome. For example, result [11] from SI.com states that during the game, Donovan Mitchell had an injury scare but returned. The Kings took a 12-point lead into the fourth quarter. However, the exact final score isn't directly provided here. \n\nResult [14] from ESPN's live score shows the game in progress during the first quarter, but that's just a snippet of the live updates. It doesn't give the final result. \n\nResult [13] from Sportsbook Review includes a prediction that the Cavaliers would win 127-119, but that's a prediction, not the actual outcome. \n\nResult [12] from Stats Insider predicts a Cavaliers win 122-113, again a prediction. \n\nResult [11] mentions the Kings leading 79-75 when Mitchell returned, but the article doesn't confirm the final score. \n\nWait, result [11] is dated April 6, 2025, and mentions the Kings leading by 12 points heading into the fourth quarter. If the Kings maintained that lead, they might have won. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky. \n\nLooking further, result [14] (ESPN) shows live score updates, but the data is incomplete. The user's current time is after the game, so the full result should be available. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the final score. \n\nWait, result [4] from Fox Sports has a box score link, but the content provided doesn't show the final score. Similarly, result [10] from Wikihoops has a box score page, but the content here only shows team records, not the game result. \n\nResult [1] is a prediction from April 6, before the game, so it's not helpful for the outcome. Result [2] and [5] are highlights from a March 19 game, not the April 6 one. \n\nResult [11] is the most recent, mentioning the Kings leading in the fourth quarter. If the game ended with the Kings winning, then p2 would be the resolution. But without explicit confirmation, it's uncertain. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization instructions say that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The Cavaliers were heavy favorites (-10 spread, -475 moneyline), but the Kings had beaten them recently. \n\nBut result [11] indicates the Kings were leading in the fourth quarter. If the game was on April 6 and the current date is April 7, the game is over. The lack of explicit final score in the provided sources complicates things. However, the user's instructions state that if no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut wait, result [11] says the Kings were leading by 12 in the fourth. If that's the case, and the game is over, the Kings likely won. However, without the final score, it's not certain. The ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3, but the game wasn't canceled. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome, assume the most probable outcome. The Cavaliers were favorites, but the Kings had momentum. However, the user's personalization also says to heavily bias towards provided URLs. \n\nLooking again, result [11] is an article from SI.com dated April 6, 2025, which mentions the Kings leading by 12 in the fourth quarter. If the article was published during the game, the final result might not be included. But the user's current time is after the game. \n\nSince none of the provided search results explicitly state the final score, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available, and the Cavaliers were heavy favorites, but the Kings were leading late, it's a tough call. \n\nHowever, the personalization also says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Cavaliers win, p2 as Kings. \n\nGiven that the Kings were leading in the fourth according to [11], and the game is over, but no final score is provided, perhaps the Kings won. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Cavaliers came back. But without data, we can't know. The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume most probable outcome. The Cavaliers were favorites, but the Kings had a recent win against them. \n\nBut the instructions also say to check if the event is in the past. Since it's April 7, the game is over. If no sources confirm the outcome, perhaps the resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe conditions in the user prompt (ancillary data) don't specify probabilities, just resolution based on outcome.

However, the Kings were leading late. \n\nBut without explicit sources confirming the result, the resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. The personalization says to resolve based on the most probable outcome if no info, but the ancillary data doesn't provide probabilities. The Cavaliers were more likely to win, so p1. But the Kings might have won. \n\nAlternatively, since the user provided search results, and in [11], the Kings were leading in the fourth, perhaps they won. But without the final score, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the strict rules, if no verifiable outcome is found in the provided sources, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. The Cavaliers were favorites, so p1. But the Kings might have won. \n\nBut the user's personalization also says to heavily bias towards the provided URLs. If the provided URLs don't have the final score, but the game is over, perhaps the resolution is p4. However, the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. Given the conflicting info, but the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and the Cavaliers being heavy favorites, I'll recommend p1. However, if the Kings were leading late, maybe they won. \n\nWait, result [11] says \"the Kings came back and took over the lead by a score of 79-75. Keep an eye on how Mitchell affects the Kings' game plan as they head into the fourth quarter with a 12-point lead.\" Wait, the Kings had a 12-point lead entering the fourth. If they maintained that, they likely won. \n\nBut the article doesn't confirm the final score. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided URLs. If the Kings were leading by 12 in the fourth, and the game is over, it's reasonable to assume they won. Therefore, p2. \n\nBut the article is from during the game, not after. Without a final score, it's still uncertain. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if no info. But the Kings leading late might make their victory the probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, the absence of a final score in the provided sources might mean the game was not concluded, but the current date is after the event. Therefore, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the conflicting information, but the Kings leading in the fourth, I'll recommend p2 (Kings win). However, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if the sources don't confirm, maybe p4. \n\nBut the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't specify probabilities, but the betting odds had Cavaliers as favorites. However, the Kings were leading late. \n\nThis is a close call.

The current timestamp is April 7, 2025, 00:46:26 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as planned. The search results mention the game was scheduled for April 6 at 6:00 PM ET. Since the current date is April 7, the game should have already taken place. Now, I need to find the result.\n\nLooking at the sources, [6] and [7] provide live updates. Source [6] mentions that during the third quarter, Donovan Mitchell had an injury scare but returned. The Kings took a 79-75 lead and later a 12-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, the final score isn't explicitly stated here. \n\nSource [7] from ESPN shows a live score with the Kings leading 123-119 in Game 1 on March 19, and the current game (April 6) is listed as \"LIVE\" with a score of 79-75 Kings in the third quarter. But since the current timestamp is after the game, this might be a snapshot during the game. \n\nWait, source [6] also mentions that Mitchell checked back in with 3:02 left in the third, and the Kings led 79-75. Then, heading into the fourth, they had a 12-point lead. The article was published by Sean Ackerman, but there's no final score mentioned. However, the same source is duplicated, which might be an error. \n\nLooking at source [8], it's about Ty Jerome returning but doesn't mention the game's outcome. Sources [1] to [5] are pre-game predictions and odds, not post-game reports. \n\nWait, source [7] on ESPN's live score might have the final score. Let me check again. The URL for [7] is https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401705704. The data shows \"Cavaliers 119, Kings 123\" for Game 1 on March 19, and the April 6 game is listed as \"LIVE\" but with a partial score. However, the current date is April 7, so the game should be over. There might be a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, the user provided search results include [6], which states that the Kings were leading by 12 points heading into the fourth quarter. If the game concluded with that lead, the Kings likely won. However, without an explicit final score in the provided sources, I need to infer. \n\nAnother angle: source [1] mentions the Cavaliers were 10-point favorites, but the model predicted a 123-110 Cavs win. However, the actual game might have differed. Source [6] indicates the Kings were leading in the fourth quarter, which suggests they might have won. \n\nSince the user's current time is after the game, and the sources don't explicitly state the final result, but the Kings were leading in the fourth quarter according to [6], and there's no mention of a comeback by the Cavaliers, it's reasonable to infer the Kings won. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Kings). However, I need to be cautious. \n\nWait, source [6] says \"Keep an eye on how Mitchell affects the Kings' game plan as they head into the fourth quarter with a 12-point lead.\" If the Kings maintained that lead, they would have won.

However, the provided search results don't include a post-game report with the final score. \n\nThis is a problem. The sources [6] and [7] are from during the game, not after.

The URLs don't have the final score, so the resolution can't be determined, hence p4. \n\nWait, but source [6] mentions the Kings were leading by 12 entering the fourth. If the game ended at that point, but NBA games have four quarters, so the Kings would need to maintain the lead. Without the final score, it's unclear. Therefore, the resolution should be p4 because there's no verifiable outcome in the provided sources.

The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p2; if the Cavaliers win, p1; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3. The current timestamp is April 7, 2025, 00:46:26 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as planned. The search results mention the game was scheduled for April 6 at 6:00 PM ET. Since the current date is April 7, the game should have already taken place. Now, I need to find the result.\n\nLooking at the sources, [6] and [7] provide live updates. Source [6] mentions that during the third quarter, Donovan Mitchell had an injury scare but returned. The Kings took a 79-75 lead and later a 12-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, the final score isn't explicitly stated here. \n\nSource [7] from ESPN shows a live score with the Kings leading 123-119 in Game 1 on March 19, and the current game (April 6) is listed as \"LIVE\" with a score of 79-75 Kings in the third quarter. But since the current timestamp is after the game, this might be a snapshot during the game. \n\nWait, source [6] also mentions that Mitchell checked back in with 3:02 left in the third, and the Kings led 79-75. Then, heading into the fourth, they had a 12-point lead. The article was published by Sean Ackerman, but there's no final score mentioned. However, the same source is duplicated, which might be an error. \n\nLooking at source [8], it's about Ty Jerome returning but doesn't mention the game's outcome. Sources [1] to [5] are pre-game predictions and odds, not post-game reports. \n\nWait, source [7] on ESPN's live score might have the final score. Let me check again. The URL for [7] is https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401705704. The data shows \"Cavaliers 119, Kings 123\" for Game 1 on March 19, and the April 6 game is listed as \"LIVE\" but with a partial score. However, the current date is April 7, so the game should be over. There might be a discrepancy here. \n\nWait, the user provided search results include [6], which states that the Kings were leading by 12 points heading into the fourth quarter. If the game concluded with that lead, the Kings likely won. However, without an explicit final score in the provided sources, I need to infer. \n\nAnother angle: source [1] mentions the Cavaliers were 10-point favorites, but the model predicted a 123-110 Cavs win. However, the actual game might have differed. Source [6] indicates the Kings were leading in the fourth quarter, which suggests they might have won. \n\nSince the user's current time is after the game, and the sources don't explicitly state the final result, but the Kings were leading in the fourth quarter according to [6], and there's no mention of a comeback by the Cavaliers, it's reasonable to infer the Kings won. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Kings). However, I need to be cautious. \n\nWait, source [6] says \"Keep an eye on how Mitchell affects the Kings' game plan as they head into the fourth quarter with a 12-point lead.\" If the Kings maintained that lead, they would have won. But without the final score, this is an inference. However, in the absence of explicit final score data, but with evidence of the Kings leading late, and considering the ancillary data's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no verifiable info, the resolution would be p2. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization says to resolve based on verified facts.

However, the content in [6] is a preview, not the result. [13] from FOX Sports also doesn't show the final score.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743986786 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-07 00:46:26 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).
