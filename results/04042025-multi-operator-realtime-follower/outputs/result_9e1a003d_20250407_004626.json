  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743986460 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-07 00:41:00 UTC",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the NBA game between the San Antonio Spurs and Portland Trail Blazers on April 6, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Trail Blazers win, p2 for Spurs win, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current timestamp is April 7, 2025, so the game happened on April 6, which is in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome using reliable sources. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [1] from CBS Sports provides a detailed recap. It mentions that the Spurs lost to the Cavaliers on April 4 and the Trail Blazers lost to the Bulls on April 4. However, the actual game in question is on April 6. Wait, the user's query is about the April 6 game. Let me check the search results again.\n\nSearch result [12] from thescore.com lists the game as occurring on April 6, 2025, with the Spurs at 32-44 and the Trail Blazers at 33-43. But this seems to be a preview, not the result. \n\nWait, search result [1] is titled \"San Antonio Spurs vs. Portland Trail Blazers Live Score and Stats\" from April 6, 2025. The URL suggests it's a gametracker, which should have the final score. The snippet mentions both teams' recent losses but doesn't explicitly state the result of their April 6 matchup. Hmm, maybe the full article has the score. The snippet says \"Blazers, Spurs square off with fleeting postseason hopes on the line\" but doesn't give the result. \n\nLooking at search result [13] from pickdawgz.com, the article is a preview dated April 6, 2025, and doesn't include the result. Similarly, result [14] from sportsgambler.com also previews the game, mentioning previous encounters but not the April 6 result. \n\nWait, search result [11] is a YouTube video titled \"SPURS at TRAIL BLAZERS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS - YouTube\" dated December 13, 2024. The description says the Spurs won 118-116, but that's from 2024, not the 2025 game in question. So that's a different game.\n\nSearch result [6] from dimers.com, updated on April 6, 2025, predicts the Trail Blazers to win 116-112. But predictions aren't results. \n\nSearch result [9] from statsinsider.com.au, dated April 6, 2025, predicts the Trail Blazers to win 115-112 on April 7, which is the day after the game in question. That might be a different matchup or a typo. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game on April 6, 2025. The current date is April 7, so the game should have happened. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of that specific game. The sources either preview the game or discuss past matchups. \n\nSince the event date is in the past and no sources confirm the outcome, according to the personalization instructions, if no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Trail Blazers win and p2 as Spurs win. \n\nLooking at the predictions, result [6] gives the Trail Blazers a 64% chance, and result [9] also predicts a Trail Blazers win. However, predictions aren't actual results. Without confirmed data, the resolution should default to p4, but the instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nBut how to determine the most probable outcome? The ancillary data doesn't provide probabilities, just resolution mappings. The user's query's ancillary data has p1 for Trail Blazers, p2 for Spurs. If the game wasn't played or no info, it's p3. But the instructions say if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, without any sources confirming the result, it's unclear. \n\nWait, perhaps the game was played, but the provided search results don't include the final score. In that case, according to the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. The predictions from sources [6] and [9] suggest Trail Blazers were favored. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1 (Trail Blazers). However, the user's instructions require strict verification. If there's no confirmed result, it should be p4. But the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. The key is whether the game was played. Since the current date is April 7, and the game was scheduled for April 6, it should have occurred. If there's no report of postponement or cancellation, and no result available, perhaps the market resolves to the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also mention that if the event has occurred but no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven that, and considering the predictions lean towards Trail Blazers, the recommendation would be p1. However, without explicit confirmation, this is uncertain. But according to the user's personalization instructions, in the absence of verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",
