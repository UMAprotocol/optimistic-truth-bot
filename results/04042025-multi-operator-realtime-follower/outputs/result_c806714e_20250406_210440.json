  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743973177 Current Date and Time: 2025-04-06 20:59:37 UTC",

If the Yankees win, it's p1; Pirates win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current timestamp is April 6, 2025, 9:01 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the game should have already taken place. Now, I need to find out the result.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources. The YouTube videos from April 4th and 5th show previous games, but the key is the April 6th game. However, the search results provided don't include a direct link to the April 6th game's outcome. Wait, the user provided some search results with dates up to April 6th. Let me check again.\n\nSearch result [2] is from April 6th and mentions the Yankees going for their third straight win, but it's a prediction article. Similarly, [4] and [5] are also predictions. The actual game highlights for April 6th might be in [3], [6], or [7]. Let me look at those.\n\nLooking at [3], the title says \"Yankees vs. Pirates Game Highlights (4/5/25)\" which is April 5th, not the 6th. Similarly, [6] and [7] are also from April 5th. Wait, the user's query is about the game on April 6th. The current date in the system is April 6th, 9 PM UTC, so the game should have happened. But the search results don't include a direct report of the April 6th game's outcome. The latest mentions are predictions, not results.\n\nWait, the user might have provided the search results before the game was played, but the current timestamp is after the game. However, the search results don't include the actual outcome. All the sources are either previews or highlights from previous days. There's no source confirming the result of the April 6th game. \n\nIn this case, according to the personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Yankees were heavily favored in the predictions ([2], [4], [5], [8]) with a high win probability. However, without concrete evidence, the resolution should default to p4 if the outcome isn't verified. But wait, the instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3, but if it's played and no info, assume the probable outcome.\n\nBut since there's no source confirming the actual result, even though predictions favor the Yankees, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve at this time). However, the current timestamp is after the game, so if the game was played, but no sources are available, perhaps due to a delay in reporting, the system might still not have info. But according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Yankees were predicted to win, so p1. But I need to check if the game was indeed played. Since the current date is April 6th, 9 PM, and the game was at 1:35 PM ET (which is 17:35 UTC), the game should have concluded. The lack of sources might be an oversight. However, the user provided search results up to April 6th, but none report the actual result.

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Pittsburgh Pirates vs. New York Yankees game on April 6, 2025, at 1:35 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins the game. If the Yankees win, it's p1; Pirates win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current timestamp is April 6, 2025, 9:01 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. So the game should have already taken place. Now, I need to find out the result.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources. The YouTube videos from April 4th and 5th show previous games, but the key is the April 6th game. However, the search results provided don't include a direct link to the April 6th game's outcome. Wait, the user provided some search results with dates up to April 6th. Let me check again.\n\nSearch result [2] is from April 6th and mentions the Yankees going for their third straight win, but it's a prediction article. Similarly, [4] and [5] are also predictions. The actual game highlights for April 6th might be in [3], [6], or [7]. Let me look at those.\n\nLooking at [3], the title says \"Yankees vs. Pirates Game Highlights (4/5/25)\" which is April 5th, not the 6th. Similarly, [6] and [7] are also from April 5th. Wait, the user's query is about the game on April 6th. The current date in the system is April 6th, 9 PM UTC, so the game should have happened. But the search results don't include a direct report of the April 6th game's outcome. The latest mentions are predictions, not results.\n\nWait, the user might have provided the search results before the game was played, but the current timestamp is after the game. However, the search results don't include the actual outcome. All the sources are either previews or highlights from previous days. There's no source confirming the result of the April 6th game. \n\nIn this case, according to the personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Yankees were heavily favored in the predictions ([2], [4], [5], [8]) with a high win probability. However, without concrete evidence, the resolution should default to p4 if the outcome isn't verified. But wait, the instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says if the game is canceled, resolve to p3, but if it's played and no info, assume the probable outcome.\n\nBut since there's no source confirming the actual result, even though predictions favor the Yankees, we can't confirm the outcome. Therefore, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve at this time). However, the current timestamp is after the game, so if the game was played, but no sources are available, perhaps due to a delay in reporting, the system might still not have info. But according to the rules, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The Yankees were predicted to win, so p1. But I need to check if the game was indeed played. Since the current date is April 6th, 9 PM, and the game was at 1:35 PM ET (which is 17:35 UTC), the game should have concluded. The lack of sources might be an oversight. However, the user provided search results up to April 6th, but none report the actual result.
