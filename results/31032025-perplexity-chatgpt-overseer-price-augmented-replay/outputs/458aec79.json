The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Utah vs. Chicago Blackhawks NHL game scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are: p1 for Blackhawks win, p2 for Utah win, p3 if the game is canceled, and it stays open if postponed. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is the day after the game. The search results mention the game took place on March 30, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple reports confirm the game occurred. For example, source [2] from CBS Sports details the game's box score, stating Utah won 5-2. Similarly, sources [5], [7], [8], and [11] all report Utah's victory with the same score. The AP article in [8] and the NHL.com recap in [7] are reliable sources. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that a Utah win should resolve to p2. All the evidence points to Utah winning decisively. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Utah Hockey Club and the Chicago Blackhawks scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET concluded with a **5-2 victory for Utah**[2][7][8]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Alexander Kerfoot** led Utah with 1 goal and 2 assists, while **Mikhail Sergachev** added 1 goal and 1 assist[2][7].\n- Utah overcame a 2-1 deficit in the second period with two goals in 31 seconds from Sergachev and Kerfoot, securing a 3-2 lead[5][8].\n- Goaltender **Karel Vejmelka** made 27 saves for Utah, and **Arvid S\u00f6derblom** stopped 26 shots for Chicago[2][7].\n\nThe game was played as scheduled, with no postponement or cancellation[1][2]. Based on the resolution conditions provided (p2 for a Utah win), the market should resolve to **\"Utah\"**.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.
