        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the New York Rangers and San Jose Sharks scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Rangers win, it's p2; Sharks win is p1; postponed keeps the market open, and canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is two days after the scheduled game date. The search results include sources from March 29 and 30, 2025, discussing the game. For example, source [1] is a prediction article from March 29, and source [7] from the same date mentions the Sharks' recent form. Source [3] is an event page confirming the game was set for March 29, 2025, at 7:30 PM local time in San Jose, which translates to 10:30 PM ET. \n\nNext, I need to determine the outcome. The search results don't explicitly state the result of the game. However, source [7] gives a prediction model favoring the Sharks with a 52.67% chance, while source [4] predicts the Rangers have a 61.54% chance. But predictions aren't results. Without any sources reporting the actual game result, I can't confirm who won. \n\nLooking for any mentions of postponement or cancellation. None of the provided sources indicate the game was postponed or canceled. Source [3] lists the event as happening, and there's no follow-up about a cancellation. The ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3, but there's no evidence of cancellation. \n\nSince the game date has passed and there's no report of cancellation, but also no report of the actual result, the next step is to check if the event occurred. If the game was played but the result isn't in the sources, maybe due to the sources being pre-game predictions, I might need to infer. However, the user's instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. \n\nThe ancillary data's resolution conditions don't mention using predictions, so relying on actual results is necessary. Since there's no verifiable outcome, and the game date has passed without reports of cancellation, the market can't be resolved as p1 or p2. However, the user's personalization rules say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's p3 is for cancellation, not lack of info. Wait, the ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3. If the game was played but the result isn't reported here, that's a different scenario. \n\nWait, the user's personalization instructions state: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So in this case, since the game date is past, and there's no info on outcome, but the ancillary data doesn't specify handling for unreported results, only for postponement or cancellation. The market should remain open if postponed, but if the game was played and the result isn't known, but the event occurred, how to resolve? \n\nBut according to the house rules in source [11] and [14], if the event isn't completed, bets are void. However, the user's ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3. Since there's no info on cancellation or postponement, but the game date has passed, perhaps the market should resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions say to use the most probable outcome if no info is available. The ancillary data's p3 is only for cancellation. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So in this case, since the game was scheduled for March 29, which is in the past, and there's no info on outcome, but the user's ancillary data doesn't have a condition for \"no result reported,\" but the resolution conditions only cover win, loss, postponement, or cancellation. Since the game wasn't canceled or postponed (as per available info), but the result isn't known, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nLooking at the predictions, source [4] gives Rangers a 61.54% chance, source [7] gives Sharks 52.67%. However, the user's instructions say to use the most probable outcome based on the conditions in the user prompt. The ancillary data doesn't provide probabilities, just mappings of outcomes to p1, p2, p3. Since the game wasn't canceled or postponed, but the result isn't available in the sources, the resolution should default to the most probable outcome. But without explicit results, this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, if the game was played but the result isn't in the sources, perhaps the market can't be resolved, leading to p4. Wait, the resolution conditions don't have a p4. Wait, the user's resolution_conditions are p1: Sharks, p2: Rangers, p3: 50-50. The personalization instructions say to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. p4 is when the event is in the future or can't be resolved. But the event is in the past. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So even if the result isn't reported, we have to assume the most probable outcome. The conditions in the user prompt (ancillary data) don't specify probabilities, just mappings. The most probable outcome would be based on the predictions in the sources. \n\nBut the sources have conflicting predictions. Source [4] says Rangers have 61.54%, source [7] says Sharks 52.67%. However, the user's instructions say to use the most probable outcome as per the conditions in the user prompt. The conditions don't provide probabilities, so perhaps the market can't be resolved, leading to p3 (50-50) only if canceled. But the game wasn't canceled. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the ancillary data's p3 is only for cancellation. Since the game wasn't canceled, and there's no result, but the event date has passed, perhaps the resolution is p3 isn't applicable. However, the user's instructions might require a p4 if unresolved, but the personalization says to use p4 only if the event is in the future. Since the event is in the past, and no info, but the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, which would be based on the predictions. \n\nBut the problem is that the sources don't agree on the probable outcome. However, the majority of sources (like [1], [4], [7]) have varying predictions, but none report the actual result. Without the actual result, but the event date passed, the market can't be resolved with certainty. However, according to the user's personalization rules, we have to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nLooking at the sources, [4] gives Rangers a higher chance (61.54%), while [7] gives Sharks 52.67%. But these are just predictions. The actual result isn't available. In such a case, the market might resolve to p3 (50-50) if the outcome is unknown, but the ancillary data specifies p3 only for cancellation. \n\nAlternatively, since the game was played (as per the date) but the result isn't reported in the sources, perhaps the resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's personalization says p4 is for future events. Since the event is in the past, and no info, but the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, which would be Rangers (p2) based on [4] and [1] favoring Rangers. \n\nBut this is speculative. The correct approach is to check if the game was played. Since the sources don't mention cancellation or postponement, and the event date has passed, it's safe to assume the game was played. However, without the result, the resolution can't be determined from the provided sources. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable outcome exists, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's p3 is for cancellation, which didn't happen. Therefore, the most probable outcome based on the conditions would be the team with higher predicted chances. \n\nBut the sources conflict. However, source [1] mentions the Rangers are favorites (-200 moneyline), which implies a higher probability. Source [4] also gives Rangers a 61.54% chance. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Rangers (p2). Hence, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the New York Rangers and San Jose Sharks was scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. Based on the provided sources, there is no verifiable information confirming the game's outcome, postponement, or cancellation. The ancillary data specifies that if the game is canceled, the market resolves to 50-50 (p3), but no sources indicate cancellation or postponement.  \n\nPrediction models from the search results gave the Rangers a 61.54% win probability[4] and the Sharks 52.67%[7], but these are pre-game estimates, not confirmed results. Since the event date has passed and no outcome is reported, the resolution defaults to the most probable outcome per the user's instructions. The Rangers were favored in betting odds (-200 moneyline)[1], aligning with their higher predicted win probability.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies the event (NHL game between the Rangers and Sharks) and the scheduled date.\n   - It acknowledges the lack of direct information on the game's outcome, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n   - The response correctly interprets the ancillary data conditions (p1 for Sharks win, p2 for Rangers win, p3 for cancellation).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The response explores the possibility of the game's occurrence and checks for postponement or cancellation, finding no evidence for either. This is a thorough approach.\n   - It struggles with the lack of direct results and attempts to infer the most probable outcome based on pre-game predictions, which is not entirely aligned with the system prompt's requirement for verified facts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response fails to find verified results of the game, which is crucial for a definitive resolution.\n   - It defaults to using pre-game predictions to infer the most probable outcome, which contradicts the instruction to rely solely on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The response does not provide a verifiable outcome of the game, which is a significant omission given the task requirements.\n   - It relies on predictive data rather than actual results, which introduces a speculative element not supported by the system prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals:**\n   - The market strongly favors the Rangers, with a price indicating 100% confidence in their win. This should heavily influence the evaluation since it contradicts the AI's initial recommendation of p1 (Sharks win).\n   - The final recommendation of p2 (Rangers win) aligns with the market signals, but the process to reach this conclusion was flawed and speculative.\n\nGiven these points, the response has significant issues in its approach, primarily its reliance on predictive rather than factual data for the resolution. The market data suggests a strong belief in a Rangers win, which the AI eventually aligns with, but not through verified factual information as required.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response relies on speculative predictions rather than verified outcomes, which does not adhere to the requirement for factual accuracy.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the New York Rangers and San Jose Sharks on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Rangers win, it's p2; if the Sharks win, p1; and if canceled, p3. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the game's outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. Source [1] is a CBS Sports recap titled \"Panarin, Fox each score 2 goals as Rangers top Sharks 6-1\" from March 30, 2025. It clearly states the Rangers won 6-1.\n2. Source [2] from ABC News also reports the same score and outcome.\n3. Source [3] from Fear the Fin details the Sharks' 6-1 loss, emphasizing the Rangers' dominance.\n4. Source [4] is a YouTube video titled \"Rangers Win 5-0 vs Sharks,\" but the description mentions a 6-1 score, which might be a typo. The detailed goals listed align with other sources.\n5. Source [5] discusses the Rangers' dominant 6-1 victory and their playoff positioning.\n6. Source [6] is another YouTube video confirming the 6-1 score.\n7. Source [7] is a breakdown from the Sharks' official site acknowledging their loss.\n8. Source [8] provides the box score again confirming the Rangers' 6-1 win.\n\nAll credible sources consistently report the Rangers won 6-1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event date is in the past and multiple reliable sources confirm the outcome, the resolution should be p2 (Rangers win). No conflicting information or uncertainties are present, so p4 isn't necessary. The answer is straightforward based on verified results.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Rangers defeated the San Jose Sharks 6-1 in their NHL game on March 29, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources. The Rangers' victory was highlighted by Artemi Panarin and Adam Fox each scoring two goals, with Jonathan Quick making 21 saves[1][2][3][8]. The Sharks' lone goal came from Cam Lund during a power play[1][3]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions specifying that a Rangers win corresponds to **p2**. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][2][3][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743432031 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:40:31 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease ensure that the resolution is based on verified outcomes of the event. If no direct information is available, consider using reliable post-event sources or official NHL updates to confirm the game's result.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response should focus on finding verified sources that confirm the game's outcome rather than relying on pre-game predictions. The logical reasoning should strictly adhere to the system prompt's instructions for factual verification.\n\n1. Dig deeper into available sources and data\n2. Be more critical of potentially unreliable sources\n3. Consider all interpretations of the query\n4. Provide more specific evidence for your recommendation\n5. Make sure your recommendation is fully justified by your analysis\n\nTry your best to find information that would lead to a definitive answer (p1/p2/p3) if possible, before defaulting to p4."
