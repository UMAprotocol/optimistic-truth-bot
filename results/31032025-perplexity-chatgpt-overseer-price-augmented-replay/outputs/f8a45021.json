The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Rays, p2 is Rockies, and p3 is 50-50 if the game is postponed, canceled, or not completed. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game on March 30. \n\nSearch result [5] from MLB.com talks about the Rays' 6-4 win over the Rockies on March 30, clinching the series. Similarly, [9] and [15] also confirm the Rays' victory with the same score. The box score in [14] lists the final score as 6-4 in favor of the Rays. Additionally, [13] mentions Pete Fairbanks recording a save in the Rays' 6-4 win. \n\nThe YouTube highlights in [8] and [16] describe the game's key moments, including the Rays' three-run inning and defensive plays leading to their win. The FOX Sports box score in [7] and [14] also shows the Rays as the winning team. \n\nSince the game was completed and the official outcome recorded by MLB is a Rays victory, the resolution should be p1. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources align on the Rays winning, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Colorado Rockies and Tampa Bay Rays played their scheduled MLB game on March 30, 2025, at George M. Steinbrenner Field. According to multiple verified sources, the **Tampa Bay Rays won 6-4**[5][9][13][14][15]. Key moments included Brandon Lowe's two-run homer, Jos\u00e9 Caballero's game-changing bunt and stolen base, and Pete Fairbanks' save[5][8][13]. The game was completed without suspension or postponement, and MLB officially recorded the outcome.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the outcome of the MLB game between the Colorado Rockies and Tampa Bay Rays on March 30, 2025, as a win for the Tampa Bay Rays with a score of 6-4. This outcome is verified through multiple sources, including MLB.com and FOX Sports, which are reliable and relevant to the event in question. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event outlined in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions outlined in the user prompt regarding the game's resolution. It checks for any indications of postponement, cancellation, or incomplete status of the game, which could affect the resolution. Finding none, it concludes with the correct resolution based on the Rays' victory. The reasoning is thorough and considers all necessary aspects to ensure the correct resolution is recommended.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is not based on a single source and thus reducing the risk of inaccuracies. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified facts and the conditions provided in the ancillary data (p1 for a Rays win).\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, biases, or errors in the response. The response is focused and directly addresses the query without unnecessary digressions.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Rays outcome, which aligns with the Perplexity recommendation (p1). This alignment further validates the accuracy of the response, as it corresponds with the collective market belief.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and does not require a rerun. It meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation is based on concrete evidence and established facts, and it aligns with the market signals, providing additional confidence in its correctness.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the specified event, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns with market price signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses multiple verified sources, and logically processes the conditions for resolution as per the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431386 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:29:46 UTC",
