The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p2 (Maple Leafs), Ducks win p1 (Ducks), postponed stays open, canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the date. The current date given is March 31, 2025, which is after the game date of March 30. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to determine who won. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] mentions the Maple Leafs won 3-2. Source [4] and [5] both detail the game, with the Leafs coming out on top. The YouTube video [3] title also indicates the game happened on March 30, and while the transcript is a bit messy, the result aligns with the other sources. The box score in [5] and [7] clearly state the final score as 3-2 in favor of Toronto. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game taking place as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. The Ducks tried a comeback but couldn't complete it, as per [4]. \n\nSince the Maple Leafs won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. All sources are consistent, so there's no ambiguity here. No conflicting information in the search results. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 in their NHL game on March 30, 2025[1][4][5][7]. Key details from the matchup:\n\n**Game Summary**  \n- Toronto built a 2-0 lead with goals from Max Domi (1st period) and Mitch Marner (2nd period)[1][5]  \n- Anaheim responded with Leo Carlsson's 20th goal of the season (2nd period) and Sam Colangelo's power play equalizer (3rd period)[4][5]  \n- Steven Lorentz scored the game-winning goal at 11:35 of the 3rd period on a deflection[1][5]  \n\n**Key Statistics**  \n- Shots: Anaheim 30, Toronto 23[4][5]  \n- Goaltending: Joseph Woll (28 saves) outdueled Lukas Dostal (20 saves)[1][5]  \n- Division impact: Toronto extended their Atlantic Division lead to 3 points[1][5]  \n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][4][5][7].

It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which consistently report a Maple Leafs win with a score of 3-2. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a Maple Leafs win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response thoroughly checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled and confirms that it occurred as scheduled. The detailed game summary and key statistics provided further support the factual accuracy of the game's outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple reliable sources. The recommendation of p2 is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The information is presented clearly and is strictly based on the event in question as outlined in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Maple Leafs, which is consistent with the verified outcome of the game. This alignment between the AI's recommendation and market sentiment further supports the accuracy of the response.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI meets the required standards of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
