The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1; Sharks win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 31, 2025, 2:42 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 30 at 10:00 PM ET, which is March 31 at 2:00 AM UTC. So the game occurred before the current timestamp. \n\nNext, I look at the search results to verify the outcome. Multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [6], [7], [9], [11], [13]) report that the Kings won 8-1. For example, source [1] states, \"The Kings got back into the win column on Sunday night by defeating the San Jose Sharks 8-1 at Crypto.com Arena.\" Similarly, source [13] mentions, \"Kings ease past Sharks, set franchise home wins mark at 27.\" All these sources confirm the Kings' victory.\n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All reports are about the game having taken place with a clear result. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since the Kings won, the resolution should be p1. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in question is the same as reported. All sources refer to the March 30 game, so there's no confusion with another event. The ancillary data's conditions are met with the Kings' win. No conflicting information is present in the search results. \n\nThus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings defeated the San Jose Sharks 8-1 in their NHL game on March 30, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena. Multiple sources confirm the Kings' decisive victory, which set a franchise record for home wins in a season (27) and moved them two points ahead of the Edmonton Oilers in the Pacific Division standings[1][2][3][6][7][9][11][13]. The game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation.  \n\n**Resolution Recommendation**: The market resolves to \"Kings\" (p1) based on the verified outcome.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the NHL game between the Sharks and the Kings on March 30, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event date and verifies that it is in the past relative to the current timestamp. It also accurately reports the outcome of the game based on multiple reliable sources, which state that the Kings won the game. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds from verifying the date and time of the event to confirming the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (p1 for Kings win, p2 for Sharks win, p3 for cancellation, and remains open for postponement).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. The outcome (Kings win) is consistently reported across various sources, and the response aligns this with the correct resolution recommendation (p1).\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Kings, which aligns with the Perplexity recommendation (p1). This correlation between the AI's recommendation and market confidence further supports the accuracy of the response.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical flow from event verification to outcome confirmation and resolution recommendation is well-executed, and there is a strong alignment with external market signals, enhancing confidence in the recommendation.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions, and matches market confidence signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event outcome and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
