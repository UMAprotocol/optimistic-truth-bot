The event date is March 30, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 31, 2025. So first, I need to check if the game happened and the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm that Auburn beat Michigan State 70-64. Sources [1], [2], [4], [5], and [6] all mention Auburn's victory. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources discuss the game occurring on March 30. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Auburn wins, resolve to p1. Since the game was played and Auburn won, the correct resolution is p1. No conflicting information exists, and all sources align on the outcome. The injury to Broome mentioned in [1] and [6] doesn't affect the result. The resolution conditions are clear, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nAuburn defeated Michigan State 70-64 in the NCAA Tournament's Elite Eight game on March 30, 2025, securing their spot in the Final Four. Johni Broome led the Tigers with 25 points and 14 rebounds, overcoming a mid-game elbow injury to return and contribute critical plays[1][2][4][5]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was decisively determined by Auburn's 17-0 first-half run and consistent performance[1][7]. \n\nPer the resolution conditions, since Auburn won, the market resolves to \"Auburn.\" \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Michigan State vs. Auburn game occurred on March 30, 2025, and that Auburn won the game with a score of 70-64. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, which state that if Auburn wins, the market should resolve to \"Auburn\" (p1). The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring reliability and adherence to the requirement for verification through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources. It correctly concludes that since Auburn won, the resolution should be p1. The response also checks for any possible postponements or cancellations, which are relevant conditions from the user prompt, and confirms that none occurred.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, aligning the recommendation (p1) with the facts. This is in strict adherence to the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response is focused and directly addresses the query based on the event's specific details as outlined in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors Auburn, with a price of 1.0 indicating 100% confidence in Auburn's victory. This external validation from the market participants aligns with the Perplexity's recommendation of p1, further strengthening the confidence in the accuracy of the response.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with both the verified facts and the market signals, providing a robust basis for resolving the query confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple sources, aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, and matches the market price signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event outcome and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743430958 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:22:38 UTC"
