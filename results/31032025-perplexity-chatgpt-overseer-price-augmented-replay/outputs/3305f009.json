The ancillary data specifies that p1 is White Sox, p2 is Angels, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and whether it was played as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 30, 2025. Sources [1], [6], [11], and [14] all report the game occurred with a final score of Angels 3, White Sox 2. So the game wasn't postponed or canceled.\n\nNext, check if the game was completed. The sources mention a rain delay in the seventh inning, but the game resumed after a 2-hour and 48-minute delay. The Angels' Kyren Paris hit a go-ahead homer in the eighth, and the game concluded with the Angels winning 3-2. MLB rules consider a game official after 5 innings, so even if it had been called earlier, it was completed properly here.\n\nThe official outcome from MLB would list the Angels as the winner. According to the resolution conditions, Angels correspond to p2. No indications of a tie or suspension without completion. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels defeated the Chicago White Sox 3-2 in their MLB game on March 30, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][6][11][14]. The game began as scheduled and was completed despite a 2-hour, 48-minute rain delay in the seventh inning[6][14]. Kyren Paris hit a go-ahead solo home run in the eighth inning, which proved decisive[1][14]. The outcome was officially recorded by MLB with no indications of postponement, cancellation, or suspension requiring resolution under special conditions[1][6][14].\n\n**Key resolution factors:**  \n- Game occurred on scheduled date (March 30) with no pre-game postponement[1][6]  \n- Completed through all 9 innings despite weather interruption[6][14]  \n- Official MLB result: Angels 3, White Sox 2[1][6][14]  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (MLB game between LAA Angels and CWS White Sox on March 30, 2025) and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. It verifies the occurrence of the game, checks for any postponements or cancellations, and confirms the game's completion and official outcome as per MLB rules. The response uses multiple sources to confirm these details, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the sources to determine that the game was not postponed or canceled, was completed on the scheduled date despite a rain delay, and ended with the Angels winning. This matches the conditions set out for resolving the market to p2 (Angels win). The reasoning is thorough and considers all necessary aspects of the game's progression and official ruling.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The alignment with the ancillary data (p1 for White Sox, p2 for Angels, p3 for unknown/50-50) is correctly applied, with the outcome leading to a recommendation of p2.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI has correctly interpreted and applied the user prompt's conditions and has provided a well-supported resolution recommendation.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Angels outcome, which aligns with the AI's recommendation of p2. This consistency between the AI's recommendation and market sentiment further supports the accuracy of the response.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its alignment with both the user prompt conditions and market signals, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, adheres to the resolution conditions, and aligns with market price signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-reasoned, uses multiple sources for verification, and correctly applies the resolution conditions without any apparent errors or biases.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743430841 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:20:41 UTC",
