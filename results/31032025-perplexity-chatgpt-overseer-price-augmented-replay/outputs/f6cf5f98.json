The ancillary data specifies that if the Knicks win, it's p1; if the Trail Blazers win, p2; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 31, 2025, so the game on March 30 is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game's result. Source [1] states the Knicks won 110-93, with Anunoby and Bridges each scoring 28 points. Source [3] and [10] are YouTube videos titled with the Knicks' victory. Source [8] also lists the final score as 110-93 in favor of the Knicks. Additionally, source [6] from FOX Sports shows the final score, and source [11] mentions the Knicks' win again. \n\nAll these sources consistently report the Knicks as the winner. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event date has passed and multiple reliable sources confirm the Knicks' victory, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Knicks defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 110-93 in their March 30, 2025 NBA game at Madison Square Garden[1][3][6][8][10]. Key factors in the outcome included:\n\n**Second-half dominance**  \nThe Knicks outscored Portland 60-35 after halftime, shooting 64% from the field in the final two quarters[1][3]. Mikal Bridges scored 21 of his 28 points in the second half, while OG Anunoby added 28 points with crucial defensive contributions (3 steals, 2 blocks)[1][8][10].\n\n**Defensive adjustments**  \nNew York forced 14 total turnovers, converting them into 18 points[3][10]. The Blazers were limited to just 35 second-half points and 15 in the fourth quarter[3][8].\n\n**Notable performances**  \n- Deni Avdija: 33 points for Portland[1][6]  \n- Josh Hart: Near triple-double (14 pts/9 ast/8 reb) with 3 steals[8]  \n- Knicks bench: Combined 31 points from Precious Achiuwa and Landry Shamet[8]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled on March 30 with no postponement or cancellation[1][6][8]. Based on the verified outcome and resolution conditions, the market should resolve to \"Knicks.\"\n\nrecommendation: p1",

It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, all of which consistently report a Knicks victory. The response adheres to the instructions by basing the resolution on concrete evidence from reliable sources and aligning the recommendation with the ancillary data provided (p1 for a Knicks win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed account of the game, including key performances and statistics that influenced the outcome, which supports the credibility of the sources cited. The logical flow from the event's occurrence to the resolution recommendation is clear and well-structured.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the game was not postponed or canceled and occurred as scheduled. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Knicks\" (p1) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt and does not introduce irrelevant information.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Knicks outcome, which aligns with the Perplexity recommendation. This correlation between the AI's recommendation and market sentiment further supports the accuracy of the response.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the system prompt instructions, and alignment with market signals, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and reliable for resolving the oracle request.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple reliable sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns with the ancillary data and market price signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is detailed, logically structured, and provides a clear and accurate resolution based on the event's verified outcome.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
