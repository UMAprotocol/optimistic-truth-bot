        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if MicroStrategy will buy 200 or more Bitcoin in their next purchase between March 25 and April 30, 2025. The resolution depends on official announcements from MicroStrategy or Michael Saylor. \n\nFirst, I need to check the latest search results provided. The most recent information is from March 31, 2025, in source [3], where Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) bought 22,048 BTC. That's well over 200, so if this purchase is their next one after March 25, then the answer is \"Yes\". \n\nLooking at the dates: the purchase in [3] happened on March 31, which is within the specified timeframe (March 25 to April 30). The next step is to confirm if this is indeed the next purchase after March 25. Since there's no mention of any purchases between March 25 and March 31 in the other sources, and [3] is the first one after March 25, this should be the relevant purchase. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if they don't announce a purchase in that period, it's \"No\". But here, they did announce a purchase of over 200 BTC within the timeframe. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nMicroStrategy's next Bitcoin purchase announcement occurred on March 31, 2025, when the company acquired 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion[3]. This purchase falls within the specified resolution window of March 25, 2025, to April 30, 2025, and significantly exceeds the 200 BTC threshold required for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe transaction was officially disclosed through Michael Saylor's X account[3], meeting the requirement for resolution source verification. With this confirmed purchase of 22,048 BTC (over 200 BTC) occurring within the designated timeframe, the market conditions are fully satisfied for a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively analyzed the factual information provided, confirming that MicroStrategy's next Bitcoin purchase announcement occurred on March 31, 2025, with the company acquiring 22,048 BTC. This purchase falls within the specified resolution window and exceeds the 200 BTC threshold required for a \"Yes\" resolution. The source of the information, Michael Saylor's X account, aligns with the resolution source requirements specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it correctly identifies the relevant purchase and confirms that it meets the conditions outlined in the user prompt. The response also correctly disregards any purchases that might have occurred outside the specified timeframe or that do not meet the resolution source criteria.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response ensures that the specific event in question (MicroStrategy's next Bitcoin purchase) and its verifiable outcomes are accurately reported based on the conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\nThere is no missing information, bias, or errors detected in the response. The response strictly adheres to the instructions to analyze events based on verified facts and to ignore any predictive or speculative information.\n\nThe alignment with market price signals is also considered. The market price from Polymarket strongly favors a \"Yes\" outcome, which is consistent with Perplexity's recommendation of p2. This alignment further strengthens confidence in the accuracy of the recommendation.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, along with its adherence to the system prompt instructions and alignment with market signals, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, adheres to the system instructions, and aligns with market price signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively verified the event using the correct sources and provided a clear and accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431618 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:33:38 UTC",
