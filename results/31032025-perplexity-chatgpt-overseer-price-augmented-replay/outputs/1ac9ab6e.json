The ancillary data specifies that if the Raptors win, it's p2; if the 76ers win, p1; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [6] all mention the game on March 30, with the Raptors winning 127-109. The YouTube videos [2], [5], [7] also back this up with highlights and scores. \n\nThe key points are the final score and the outcome. All sources agree the Raptors won, which means according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Raptors\"). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. The 76ers lost, so p1 isn't correct either. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources consistently report the Raptors' victory. Even the ESPN recaps and CBS Sports articles confirm the same score and outcome. No sources indicate a different result or any cancellation. Therefore, the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and Philadelphia 76ers scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET concluded with the Raptors winning 127-109[1][2][3][4][6]. Multiple sources confirm the outcome, including detailed game recaps and box scores showing Toronto's consistent lead throughout the game, with R.J. Barrett scoring 31 points[3][4][6]. The 76ers extended their losing streak to eight games[1][6].  \n\nSince the game occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled, the market resolves based on the Raptors' victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively verifies the occurrence of the NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and the Philadelphia 76ers, scheduled for March 30, 2025, and confirms that the Raptors won the game with a score of 127-109. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Raptors win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\nThe response demonstrates a thorough verification process by citing multiple sources that confirm the game took place and the Raptors' victory. It also correctly identifies that there was no postponement or cancellation of the game, which rules out the resolution of p3. The response does not mention any conflicting information or discrepancies from the sources, ensuring a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the reported outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the response aligns with the market price signals from Polymarket, which strongly favor the Raptors' outcome, further validating the correctness of the recommendation. The market confidence in the Raptors' victory supports the resolution recommendation of p2.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The logical reasoning is sound, and the response adheres strictly to the conditions outlined in the user prompt. The response also correctly uses the current date and time to establish that the event is in the past and therefore eligible for resolution based on the outcome.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and does not require a rerun. It meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event, aligns with the ancillary data, and is supported by strong market signals.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743430977 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:22:57 UTC"
