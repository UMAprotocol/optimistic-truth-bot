If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the MLB game between the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Yankees on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is for a Yankees win, p2 for Brewers, and p3 if it's a tie or unresolved. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the date of the game. The query mentions March 30, and the current date provided is March 31, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Checking the search results, multiple sources [1][2][5][6][7][8] report that the Yankees won the game. Specifically, source [1] states the Yankees won 12-3, and source [6] mentions a series sweep, which implies the third game was also a Yankees victory. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or suspended. All sources reference the game taking place on March 30 with a clear result, so it was completed as scheduled. The official MLB outcome would have been recorded, and there's no mention of the game being called early or resulting in a tie. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that the market resolves based on the official MLB outcome. Since the Yankees won decisively according to multiple verified sources, the correct resolution is p1. There's no conflicting information, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Yankees defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 12-3 on March 30, 2025, completing a three-game series sweep[1][6]. The game was played as scheduled with no postponements or suspensions, and it reached official completion under MLB rules[8]. Aaron Judge led the Yankees with a two-run homer, while Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Ben Rice also contributed home runs[1][5]. The Brewers' only runs came from Jake Bauers' two-run homer in the 4th inning[1][8]. \n\nKey game details:\n- **Final score**: NYY 12 - MIL 3[1][8]\n- **Winning pitcher**: Marcus Stroman (Yankees)[5]\n- **Losing pitcher**: Aaron Civale (Brewers)[5]\n- **Definitive moment**: Ryan Yarbrough secured the final out via groundout in the 9th inning to complete the sweep[6]\n\nThe game's official outcome recorded by MLB shows a clear Yankees victory, meeting all resolution criteria without any suspensions, ties, or incomplete statuses[1][6][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, detailing the process of verifying the game's occurrence, outcome, and compliance with the specified resolution conditions. It provides a comprehensive summary of the game, including key details and players involved, which supports the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks for any conditions that might alter the resolution (e.g., postponements, suspensions). It confirms that the game was completed as scheduled and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the factual outcome of the Yankees winning.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response remains objective and focused on the event specified in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Yankees outcome, which aligns with Perplexity's recommendation of p1.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743430955 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:22:35 UTC",
