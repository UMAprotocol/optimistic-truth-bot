If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

The current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the Elite Eight games. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm that Auburn defeated Michigan State on March 30, 2025, to advance to the Final Four. For example, source [4] states, \"Auburn (32-5) earned its second Final Four trip,\" and source [7] mentions they became the last No. 1 seed to advance. All the sources from 1 to 8 consistently report Auburn's victory and their qualification. Since the Final Four is determined by the time of the query, and the resolution conditions state that if the team advances, it's \"Yes\" (p2). There's no indication of any cancellations or changes post-March 30. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nAuburn has successfully advanced to the 2025 NCAA March Madness Final Four, as confirmed by multiple official reports. The Tigers secured their spot by defeating Michigan State 70-64 in the Elite Eight on March 30, 2025[4][5][6][7][8]. This marks their second Final Four appearance in program history, with their first occurring in 2019 under coach Bruce Pearl[2][4][6]. As the top overall seed in the tournament, Auburn joins fellow No. 1 seeds Florida, Duke, and Houston in the national semifinals[3][4][7], marking the first time all four top seeds have reached the Final Four since 2008[3][4][7]. The resolution conditions specify that markets should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) if the team advances, and with Auburn's qualification definitively confirmed through NCAA tournament results[1][4][7], the outcome is clear.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that Auburn has advanced to the 2025 NCAA March Madness Final Four based on their victory over Michigan State on March 30, 2025. The response uses multiple sources to confirm this event, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts. The response also correctly applies the resolution condition from the user prompt, which states that the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) if Auburn advances to the Final Four.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a logical explanation of why the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2), citing Auburn's victory and their advancement to the Final Four. It also mentions the historical context of Auburn's previous Final Four appearance and the significance of all top seeds reaching the Final Four, which, while not necessary for the resolution, adds depth to the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event of Auburn advancing to the Final Four through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) with these verified facts. There is no indication of any event cancellations or changes that would affect this outcome.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question as outlined in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the \"Yes\" outcome, with a price of 1.0 indicating 100% confidence. This external market confidence supports the AI's recommendation of p2, enhancing the reliability of the response.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It accurately resolves the query based on verified facts, adheres strictly to the user prompt instructions, and aligns with external market signals. Therefore, no rerun is required, and the response can be confidently used.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the query based on verified facts, adheres to the user prompt instructions, and aligns with strong market confidence signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event, applies the resolution conditions correctly, and provides additional context that enriches the factual reporting without introducing bias or errors.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431244 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:27:24 UTC",
