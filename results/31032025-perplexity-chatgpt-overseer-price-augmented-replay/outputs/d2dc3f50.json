        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Calgary Flames vs. Edmonton Oilers game on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Oilers win, it's p1; Flames win, p2; postponed or canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, so the game has already occurred. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. \n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find out who won. The first result [1] is a bit confusing because the title mentions March 29, but the detailed info shows a game on March 30. However, result [3] from ESPN clearly states the final score as Oilers 3-2 Flames in overtime on March 29, 2025. Result [4] also mentions the Oilers' 3-2 OT win, and [7] has a video titled \"Draisaitl gets the OT winner\" confirming the Oilers' victory. \n\nLooking at other sources, [10] is a game recap from the Oilers' official site, which details the overtime win led by Leon Draisaitl's two goals. The YouTube video in [11] also shows highlights of the Oilers winning in overtime. \n\nAll credible sources agree that the Oilers won the game in overtime. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Oilers). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Some sources like [2] and [5] are predictions before the game, but the post-game results are consistent. The correct outcome is an Oilers win, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers on March 29, 2025, concluded with the **Edmonton Oilers winning 3-2 in overtime**[3][4][7][10][11]. Leon Draisaitl scored the decisive goal 2:25 into overtime, marking his 51st goal of the season and securing the victory for Edmonton[7][10]. This result aligns with the resolution conditions provided, where an Oilers win corresponds to **p1**. \n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is verified through multiple sources, including official NHL highlights[7], ESPN\u2019s final score report[3], and the Oilers\u2019 post-game recap[10]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game has already occurred, based on the current timestamp provided. It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple credible sources, including ESPN and the official Oilers website, which confirm the Oilers' victory in overtime. This aligns perfectly with the user prompt's resolution conditions where an Oilers win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the event date, searches for the outcome, and confirms the result using several sources. It also ensures that there is no conflicting information about the game being postponed or canceled. The logical flow from verifying the event date to confirming the game outcome and cross-referencing multiple sources is clear and thorough.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through reliable sources. The recommendation of p1 (Oilers win) is directly based on these verifications, which is in full compliance with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI has focused solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Oilers outcome, with a confidence level of 1.0 (100%). This external validation further supports the accuracy of the Perplexity AI's recommendation.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is both accurate and complete, adhering strictly to the instructions and verified facts. There is no contradictory information or deviation from the expected logical process in handling the oracle request.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the NHL game using multiple credible sources, aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions, and is supported by strong market confidence signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and methodically verifies the event outcome without any apparent errors or biases.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
