        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Twins vs. Cardinals game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies how different scenarios should be handled. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if the game was played and completed. The search results mention a game on March 30 with highlights, so the game did start. The video transcript from [1] describes the game progressing through several innings, with the Cardinals leading 8-2. However, there's mention of a thunderstorm approaching, leading to the tarp being put on the field and fans being asked to seek shelter. This suggests the game was suspended due to weather.\n\nNext, I need to check MLB rules regarding suspended games. According to [2], if a game is called after five innings, it's a regulation game and can be suspended to be finished later. The rules in [4] state that a game is official after five innings, and if suspended, it's resumed later. The game in question was in the third inning when the storm hit, as per [1], which is before the fifth inning. Since it didn't reach the fifth inning, the game isn't official yet. \n\nThe ancillary data says if the game is suspended and not completed by April 1, it resolves to 50-50. The current date is March 31, and there's no info in the search results about the game being resumed by April 1. Therefore, the market should resolve to p3 (50-50). \n\nI also check if there's any mention of the game being resumed. The sources don't indicate that, so the suspension stands. The final answer is p3.\n</think>\n\nThe Minnesota Twins vs. St. Louis Cardinals game on March 30, 2025, began but was suspended in the third inning due to a thunderstorm[1]. At the time of suspension, the Cardinals led 8-2[1]. However, MLB rules require at least five completed innings (or 4.5 if the home team is ahead) for a game to be declared official[2][4]. Since the game was halted before reaching this threshold, it remains suspended and must be resumed later[7]. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the game isn\u2019t completed by April 1, 11:59 PM, the market resolves to 50-50. As of March 31 (current date), no evidence indicates the game was resumed or completed by the deadline[1][6]. The official MLB records for March 30 list the game as suspended[6], and no subsequent completion is documented in the provided sources. \n\nrecommendation: p3",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths and weaknesses that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (MLB game between the Twins and the Cardinals on March 30, 2025) and adheres to the user prompt's conditions for resolution. It correctly notes that the game was suspended due to weather before the completion of five innings, which aligns with the MLB rules cited.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows the conditions set in the user prompt for different scenarios (game suspension, completion rules, etc.). It concludes that since the game was not resumed by April 1, the market should resolve to 50-50 (p3). This reasoning is complete and follows the prompt's instructions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its suspension due to weather, using the provided sources. The recommendation to resolve the market as 50-50 (p3) is based on the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt and is aligned with the facts presented.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information and sticks to the facts needed to resolve the query.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information indicates a strong belief in a Cardinals win (price of 1.0 for Cardinals, 0 for Twins). However, since the game was suspended and not completed, the market's confidence in a Cardinals win does not impact the resolution based on the rules set in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It adheres to the user prompt's instructions, uses logical reasoning, and aligns the recommendation with the verified facts of the event. The response also correctly ignores the market price signals since they do not apply to the resolution conditions specified for a suspended game.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately follows the user prompt's conditions, logically processes the event's details, and aligns the recommendation with the verified facts.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431148 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:25:48 UTC",
