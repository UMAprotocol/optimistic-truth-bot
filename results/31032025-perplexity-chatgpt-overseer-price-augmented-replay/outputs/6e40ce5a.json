The ancillary data specifies that if the Hawks win, it's p2; if the Bucks win, p1; postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, check the current date: March 31, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 30, which is in the past. So the event has already occurred. Need to confirm the result.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12) report that the Hawks won 145-124. For example, source 1 states the Hawks beat the Bucks 145-124. Source 2 from the AP confirms the same score. All the recent articles from March 30 or 31 mention the Hawks' victory. \n\nNo sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. The game was played as scheduled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since the Hawks won, the market should resolve to p2. \n\nNeed to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources agree on the outcome. No mention of the game being rescheduled or canceled. So the answer is clear: recommend p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 145-124 in their March 30, 2025 matchup[1][2][3][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. Multiple sources confirm the Hawks secured a decisive victory, with rookie Zaccharie Risacher scoring a season-high 36 points and Dyson Daniels setting Atlanta's single-season steals record[2][3][10]. The game occurred as scheduled without postponement or cancellation[1][2][3][6][12].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Hawks 145, Bucks 124[1][2][3][6][12]\n- The Hawks overcame Milwaukee's strong first-quarter performance (44-37 Bucks lead) with a 45-point second quarter[1][6][12]\n- Atlanta dominated the third quarter 36-17 to build an insurmountable 26-point lead[2][3][6][12]\n\nPer the resolution conditions, since the Hawks won decisively and the game was completed as scheduled, this market resolves to **\"Hawks\"**.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively verifies the outcome of the NBA game between the Hawks and the Bucks, which took place on March 30, 2025, and confirms that the Atlanta Hawks won the game with a score of 145-124. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Hawks win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\nThe response is logically sound and thorough in its verification process. It cites multiple sources confirming the game's outcome, ensuring that the information is reliable and not based on a single source. The response also checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and finds none, further supporting the resolution based on the game being played as scheduled.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the event specified and its verifiable outcomes. The response does not include unnecessary information or assumptions beyond what is required for resolution.\n\nThe alignment with market price signals from Polymarket, which strongly favor the Hawks outcome, adds an additional layer of confidence to the recommendation. The market's strong confidence in the Hawks winning is consistent with the factual outcome verified by the response.\n\nGiven the detailed verification, adherence to the prompt instructions, and alignment with market signals, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Hawks vs. Bucks game, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns with strong market signals confirming the Hawks' victory.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring reliability and accuracy.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
