        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Dallas Stars vs. Seattle Kraken NHL game scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Stars win, it's p2; if the Kraken win, p1; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date (March 29) is in the past. Now, looking through the search results, several sources report the outcome. \n\nSearch result [4] mentions the Stars beat the Kraken 5-1 on March 30, 2025, clinching a playoff spot. Wait, the game was scheduled for March 29, but this says March 30. Hmm, maybe a time zone difference? The game was in Seattle, which is PT, so March 29 at 10:30 PM ET would be 7:30 PM PT on the same day. However, the article from [4] is dated March 30, which could be the publication date. Let me check other sources.\n\nLooking at [9], the CBS Sports recap from March 30, 2025, states the Stars won 5-1 on Saturday night, March 29. Similarly, [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], and [16] all confirm the Stars' 5-1 victory over the Kraken on March 29. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as multiple sources report the details of the match, including goals scored and player stats. \n\nThe user's resolution conditions are clear: a Stars win resolves to p2. Since all credible sources confirm the Stars won, the market should resolve to p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. The ancillary data's p1 (Kraken win) also doesn't apply here. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All search results about this game point to a Stars victory. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. Therefore, the resolution is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Dallas Stars defeated the Seattle Kraken 5-1 in their NHL game on March 29, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources detailing the game's outcome[9][10][12][13][15]. The Stars secured a playoff berth with this victory, while the Kraken were mathematically eliminated from postseason contention[10][12]. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with Jake Oettinger making 35 saves for Dallas and Jason Robertson contributing a goal[13][15].  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **p2** (Stars win) based on the verified game result.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (NHL game between Dallas Stars and Seattle Kraken on March 29, 2025) and correctly states the outcome based on multiple reliable sources. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and not predicting or assuming outcomes without evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event is in the past and then proceeds to verify the outcome through multiple sources. The reasoning is sound, and the response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the market based on the specified conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It aligns the recommendation (p2 for a Dallas Stars win) directly with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response correctly interprets the event's date and outcome, checks for postponements or cancellations, and uses multiple sources to confirm the information.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Stars outcome, which aligns with the Perplexity AI's recommendation of p2. This alignment further validates the accuracy of the response.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation of p2 is supported by verified facts and aligns with market signals, indicating a high level of confidence in the outcome.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome, adheres to the instructions, and aligns with market signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the event outcome and provided a clear, well-reasoned recommendation based on the user prompt and ancillary data.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431437 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:30:37 UTC",
