        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if MicroStrategy purchased Bitcoin between March 25 and March 31, 2025, based on official announcements. The resolution depends on whether they made an acquisition in that timeframe.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any announcements during that period. Let's look through the sources provided.\n\nLooking at result [3], it's from March 31, 2025. It states that Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) acquired 22,048 Bitcoin for $1.92 billion at an average price of $86,969 each. The purchase was announced on March 31 via a post by Michael Saylor. That falls within the March 25-31 window.\n\nResult [8] also mentions the same purchase on March 25, 2025, noting that the acquisition was made and funded through stock sales. The filing date is March 25, which is within the specified period.\n\nAdditionally, result [13] from March 30, 2025, talks about Michael Saylor increasing Bitcoin holdings, but the details here might refer to the same purchase mentioned in [3] and [8]. However, the exact date of the announcement in [13] is March 30, which is within the timeframe.\n\nThe key point is that the official announcements from MicroStrategy or Michael Saylor during March 25-31 confirm the purchase. Since both [3] and [8] are from within the date range and cite official filings or Saylor's posts, this meets the resolution conditions for \"Yes\" (p2). There's no conflicting information in other sources that suggests no purchase was made in this period. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nMicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, **did purchase Bitcoin between March 25 and March 31, 2025**. On **March 31**, the company announced the acquisition of **22,048 BTC** for **$1.92 billion** at an average price of **$86,969 per Bitcoin**[3][8]. This purchase was disclosed in a regulatory filing and confirmed by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor via social media[3][8]. The transaction was funded through proceeds from stock sales, including common shares and preferred stock offerings[3][8].  \n\nThis acquisition increased Strategy\u2019s total Bitcoin holdings to **528,185 BTC**, with an average purchase price of **$67,458 per Bitcoin**[3][8]. The announcement falls within the specified resolution window (March 25\u201331, 2025) and meets the criteria of official communication from the company or its leadership.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431169 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:26:09 UTC",
