The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Rockets vs. Suns game scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Rockets win, it's p2; if the Suns win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game was supposed to take place yesterday. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources confirming the game's outcome. Sources [1], [9], and [10] all mention that the Rockets defeated the Suns 148-109 on March 30. Specifically, source [1] states, \"The Rockets defeated the Suns, 148-109 tonight in Phoenix,\" and source [10] provides a detailed recap of the game, including player stats and the final score. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The search results include pre-game predictions (sources [4], [8], [12], [16]) and post-game summaries (sources [1], [9], [10], [14]), all of which treat the game as having occurred. There's no indication in any of the results that the game was delayed or canceled. \n\nAdditionally, source [14] discusses an injury to Kevin Durant during the game, which further confirms that the game took place as scheduled. The article mentions Durant's injury occurring in the third quarter, aligning with the game's timeline. \n\nSince the game was played on the scheduled date and the Rockets won decisively, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no ambiguity here; all sources agree on the outcome, and there's no conflicting information about postponement or cancellation.\n</think>\n\nThe Houston Rockets defeated the Phoenix Suns 148-109 in their March 30, 2025, NBA game[1][9][10]. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][9][10][14]. The Rockets dominated, with Jalen Green scoring 33 points and eight Houston players reaching double-digit scoring[1][10]. Phoenix's Kevin Durant left with an ankle injury in the third quarter[10][14], but the game concluded normally.\n\n**Key details:**  \n- Final score: Rockets 148, Suns 109[1][9]  \n- Game occurred March 30 at 9:00 PM ET as planned[1][9]  \n- No evidence of postponement/cancellation in any sources[1][3][9][13]  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **p2 (Rockets)**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Rockets win corresponds to a resolution of p2. The response correctly ignores any potential for the game being postponed or canceled, as there is no evidence to suggest either occurred.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for the occurrence of the game, confirms the outcome, and verifies that there were no postponements or cancellations. It uses multiple sources to confirm the details of the game, which strengthens the reliability of the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) directly with the verified facts. This is in strict adherence to the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response thoroughly covers the necessary aspects to resolve the market based on the user prompt's conditions.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Rockets, which aligns with the Perplexity recommendation of p2. This correlation between the AI's recommendation and market sentiment further validates the accuracy of the response.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It adheres closely to the instructions, is factually accurate, logically sound, and aligns with external market signals. There is no need for a rerun as the response meets all the required criteria for a confident and accurate resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the Rockets vs. Suns game, adheres to the user prompt instructions, and aligns with strong market signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively utilized multiple sources to confirm the event details and outcome, ensuring a reliable and accurate resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431248 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:27:28 UTC",
