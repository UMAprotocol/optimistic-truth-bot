        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Delhi Capitals (DC) vs Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) IPL match scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 6:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if DC wins, the resolution is \"Delhi\" (p2), if SRH wins, it's \"Hyderabad\" (p1), and if the game isn't completed by April 5, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the actual result of the match. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, which is after the match date. The search results are from March 30 and 31, 2025, so they should cover the event. \n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. Result 1 (NDTV Sports) states DC beat SRH by 7 wickets with four overs to spare. Key players mentioned are Mitchell Starc and Faf du Plessis. The scorecard shows DC 166/3 (16 overs) vs SRH 163/10 (18.4 overs). This clearly indicates a DC win.\n\n2. Result 2 (IPLT20.com) confirms DC's 7-wicket victory, moving them to second in the points table. Starc's 5/35 and Kuldeep's 3/22 are highlighted, along with Faf's 50 off 27 balls.\n\n3. Result 3 (Cricket.one) reiterates DC's comprehensive win, noting Starc's five-wicket haul and Faf's half-century. The target was chased in 16 overs.\n\n4. Result 5 (Times of India) and Result 6 (Chron.com) both report DC's dominant performance, with Starc's 5-35 and Faf's 50 off 27. The match ended with DC winning by 7 wickets.\n\n5. Other sources (4,7,8) also consistently report DC's victory, with no conflicting information. All sources agree on the outcome, the margin of victory, and key performers.\n\nSince the match was completed on March 30, well before the April 5 deadline, the 50-50 condition doesn't apply. All evidence points to DC winning, so the resolution should be p2 (Delhi). There's no ambiguity here; the sources are unanimous. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nDelhi Capitals defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in their IPL 2025 match on March 30, 2025, at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam. After SRH posted 163/10 in 18.4 overs, DC chased down the target in just 16 overs, reaching 166/3 with four overs to spare[1][2][5][6]. Mitchell Starc's 5/35 (his first T20 five-wicket haul) and Faf du Plessis' 50 off 27 balls were pivotal in DC's dominant performance[2][5][6]. The match concluded decisively before the April 5 deadline, with no unresolved contingencies affecting the outcome.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the outcome of the Delhi Capitals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad IPL match held on March 30, 2025, confirming that Delhi Capitals won the match. This outcome aligns perfectly with the user prompt's conditions for resolution, which state that if Delhi Capitals win, the market should resolve to \"Delhi\" (p2).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a thorough analysis of the match outcome, citing multiple reliable sources that confirm Delhi Capitals' victory. The reasoning is logically structured, starting from verifying the match date and outcome, to confirming the details of the match performance, and finally aligning these facts with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event by checking multiple sources and confirms that the event occurred as described in the user prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Delhi) is directly based on the verified outcome of the match.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and uses verified sources to confirm the match outcome.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Delhi outcome, with a price of 1.0 indicating 100% confidence in this outcome. This external validation from the market participants aligns perfectly with the Perplexity AI's recommendation of p2 (Delhi), further strengthening the confidence in the recommendation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, adheres strictly to the instructions, and aligns with external market signals.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743430942 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:22:22 UTC",
