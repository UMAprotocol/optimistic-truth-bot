The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if they advance, \"No\" (p1) if eliminated, and p3 if unknown. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the Elite Eight game between Michigan State and Auburn.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [7], [9], [10], [11], [13], [15]) report that Michigan State lost to Auburn in the Elite Eight on March 30, 2025. For example, source [1] states that Michigan State fell to Auburn 64-70, eliminating them from the tournament. Source [7] confirms Auburn's victory and their advancement to the Final Four, while Michigan State's elimination is detailed in [11] and [13]. Since the Elite Eight is the round before the Final Four, a loss here means Michigan State cannot advance further. All sources agree on the outcome, and the date of the game is before the resolution deadline. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nMichigan State's men's basketball team, seeded No. 2 in the South Region, was eliminated from the 2025 NCAA Tournament after losing 64-70 to top-seeded Auburn in the Elite Eight round on March 30, 2025[1][7][9][11][13]. The Spartans trailed by nine points at halftime and struggled with 34.4% field goal shooting, failing to overcome Auburn's early 17-0 scoring run[11][13]. With this loss, Michigan State fell short of reaching the Final Four, which requires winning the Elite Eight game[1][7][9][10].\n\nAuburn advanced to the Final Four alongside Florida, Duke, and Houston, marking the second time in program history[1][7][9][13]. The NCAA's official bracket and tournament results confirm Michigan State\u2019s elimination at the Elite Eight stage[2][4][8]. Since the team was definitively eliminated before the Final Four and the resolution deadline of May 31, 2025, has not passed, the market resolves based on the outcome of the competition. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on factual information and verified sources to determine the outcome of Michigan State's participation in the 2025 NCAA March Madness Final Four. Here is a breakdown of the evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately reports that Michigan State was eliminated from the tournament after losing to Auburn in the Elite Eight, which is before the Final Four stage. This information is supported by multiple sources cited in the response, which aligns with the requirement to use verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically concludes that since Michigan State did not advance past the Elite Eight, they did not make it to the Final Four. The reasoning is sound and well-supported by the sources cited, which include specific details about the game and the outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event (Michigan State's elimination in the Elite Eight) using multiple reliable sources. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) is correctly aligned with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question and uses appropriate sources to substantiate its claims.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the \"No\" outcome, with a price of 1.0 for the \"No\" token, indicating 100% confidence. This aligns perfectly with Perplexity's recommendation of p1, further validating the accuracy of the response.\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, adherence to the prompt instructions, and alignment with market signals, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and reliable. There is no need for a rerun as the response meets all the required criteria for accuracy and completeness.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and comprehensively analyzed the event using verified sources, logically concluded based on the facts, and aligned perfectly with market price signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the event and adhered strictly to the user prompt and ancillary data conditions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431930 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:38:50 UTC",
