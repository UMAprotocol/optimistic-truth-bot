The ancillary data specifies that if the Canadiens win, it's p2 (\"Canadiens\"), Panthers win is p1 (\"Panthers\"), and if canceled or postponed, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is the day after the game was scheduled. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the result using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [2][3][5][6][7][8] report that the Montreal Canadiens won the game 4-2 against the Florida Panthers on March 30. For example, source [2] states, \"Nick Suzuki scored to lead the Montreal Canadiens to a 4-2 win over the Florida Panthers on Sunday.\" Similarly, source [8] details the scoring, ending with the Canadiens winning 4-2. \n\nAll these sources are consistent in reporting the Canadiens' victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the game took place as scheduled and the Canadiens won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Canadiens\"). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The other sources, like [1], are pre-game odds and don't affect the outcome. Source [4] refers to a different game on March 15, which the Canadiens also won, but that's irrelevant here. All relevant post-game reports confirm the March 30 result. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens defeated the Florida Panthers 4-2 in their NHL game on March 30, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[2][3][5][6][7][8]. The game occurred as scheduled at 1:07 PM ET with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Key details include:\n\n- **Final score**: Canadiens 4, Panthers 2  \n- **Winning team**: Montreal Canadiens (p2 resolution condition)  \n- **Game status**: Completed without modifications  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response correctly identifies that the game was not postponed or canceled and thus resolves the market to p2 (\"Canadiens\"), in line with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it checks the current date to confirm the event has occurred and then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources.

This alignment with market sentiment indicates a high level of confidence in the resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, ensuring that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, alignment with market signals, and adherence to the prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event using multiple reliable sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns with market price signals, confirming the Canadiens' victory.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used the provided ancillary data and reliable sources to confirm the event outcome, disregarded irrelevant information, and aligned with market confidence indicators.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431714 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:35:14 UTC"
