        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Boston Red Sox vs. Texas Rangers game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Rangers, p2 is Red Sox, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on March 30. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Source [4] from CBS Sports has a detailed report stating the Rangers won 3-2. It mentions Wyatt Langford and Adolis Garc\u00eda hitting home runs in the sixth inning. The final score is confirmed there. \n\nSource [6] and [14] from Fox Sports also show the box score with the Rangers winning 3-2. The box score lists the runs, hits, and errors, which align with the AP report. Additionally, source [5] and [13] are condensed game videos from MLB.com, corroborating the Rangers' victory. \n\nThe user's query mentions that the resolution depends on the official MLB outcome. All the provided sources, especially the AP news article and official MLB box scores, confirm the Rangers as the winner. There's no indication of the game being postponed, suspended, or tied. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Rangers). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other sources like [10] and [12] discuss predictions before the game, but the actual result is clearly reported post-game. No sources suggest a different outcome. The final score is consistent across multiple reputable sources, so the resolution is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Texas Rangers defeated the Boston Red Sox 3-2 on March 30, 2025, in a game that featured late-inning home runs from Wyatt Langford and Adolis Garc\u00eda[4][6][14]. The Rangers held Boston to 0-12 with runners in scoring position and stranded 10 baserunners[4]. Jacob deGrom pitched 5 scoreless innings for Texas in his first start of the season, allowing just two hits[4][7].\n\n**Key game details:**\n- Rangers scored first on Ezequiel Dur\u00e1n's sacrifice fly in the 2nd inning[4]\n- Red Sox took a 2-1 lead in the 6th on Wilyer Abreu's RBI double and a defensive error[4]\n- Langford and Garc\u00eda hit back-to-back solo HRs in the bottom of the 6th for the decisive runs[4][6]\n- Luke Jackson earned the save with a scoreless 9th inning[4]\n\nThe game was completed on schedule with no postponements or suspensions[4][6]. As the official MLB outcome shows a Rangers victory, this market resolves to **p1** (Texas Rangers).\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively analyzed the outcome of the MLB game between the Boston Red Sox and the Texas Rangers on March 30, 2025, and provided a clear resolution based on the official results as recorded by Major League Baseball.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the winner of the game as the Texas Rangers with a score of 3-2. It cites multiple sources, including CBS Sports and Fox Sports, which confirm the game's outcome. The response adheres to the user prompt's instructions by resolving the market based on the official MLB outcome and not on predictions or unverified sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the event date and then confirming the game's outcome through reliable sources. It includes detailed information about the game's key moments, which supports the final resolution recommendation. The response also checks for any indications of postponement, suspension, or a tie, which could affect the market resolution, and finds none.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple reputable sources. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for Rangers' win) directly with the facts as verified.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response focuses solely on verified facts and the specific event in question, as required by the system prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Rangers' outcome, which aligns with Perplexity's recommendation.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431608 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:33:28 UTC",
