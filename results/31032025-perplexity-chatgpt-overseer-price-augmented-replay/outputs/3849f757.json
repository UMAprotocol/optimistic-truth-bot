The ancillary data specifies that if the Sabres win, it's p2; if the Capitals win, p1. The game was scheduled for March 30 at 3:00 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, which is the day after the game. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to confirm the result using the search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]) report that the Buffalo Sabres defeated the Washington Capitals with a score of 8-5. For example, source [1] states, \"The Buffalo Sabres beat the Washington Capitals 8-5 on March 30, 2025.\" Similarly, source [2] mentions the Sabres' victory. All other sources corroborate this result, including ESPN and NHL.com. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All reports indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since the Sabres won, the market should resolve to p2. \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The ancillary data doesn't mention any other conditions affecting the resolution, like specific events during the game. The score and result are clear. \n\nThus, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres defeated the Washington Capitals 8-5 in their NHL game on March 30, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][3][4][6][7][8]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Key highlights include:\n\n- **Sabres' offensive dominance**: Alex Tuch (2 goals, 1 assist) and Tage Thompson (2 power-play goals) led Buffalo\u2019s scoring, supported by goals from Jack Quinn, Ryan McLeod, Sam Lafferty, and Peyton Krebs[2][3][6][7].\n- **Capitals' efforts**: Washington\u2019s Jakob Chychrun scored twice, while Alex Ovechkin netted his 890th career goal[4][8]. Despite narrowing Buffalo\u2019s lead to 6-5 in the third period, the Capitals couldn\u2019t complete the comeback[2][6].\n\nThe game concluded with a Sabres victory, meeting the ancillary data\u2019s resolution condition for a **Sabres win**. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The game result, with the Sabres winning 8-5, aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies that a Sabres win should resolve the market to \"p2.\"\n\nThe response is logically sound and thorough in its verification process. It confirms that the game was not postponed or canceled and took place as scheduled. The details provided about the game, including key players and scores, add to the credibility and depth of the response. The response also correctly ignores any irrelevant information and focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt.\n\nThere is no missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The alignment with the market price signals from Polymarket, which strongly favor the Sabres outcome, further supports the accuracy of the recommendation. The market confidence in the Sabres' victory matches the factual outcome verified by the oracle.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431306 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:28:26 UTC"
