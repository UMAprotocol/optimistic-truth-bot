The ancillary data specifies that if the Pistons win, it's p2; if the Timberwolves win, p1; postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query says March 30 at 7:00 PM ET. The current date provided is March 31, 2025, so the game has already occurred. That means I don't have to worry about future dates or postponement. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources report the outcome. Source [2] from CBS Sports mentions the Timberwolves won 123-104. Source [4] from ESPN also confirms the same score. Source [6] and [10] from SI.com detail the game, including the fight and the Timberwolves' comeback. Source [9] and [13] discuss the brawl but also note the Timberwolves' victory. \n\nAll these sources consistently state that Minnesota won. The final score is 123-104 in favor of the Timberwolves. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable. Since the Timberwolves won, the resolution should be p1.\n\nI need to make sure there's no conflicting information. All the relevant sources agree on the outcome. Even though some articles are previews (like [1], [3], [5], [7]), the post-game reports ([2], [4], [6], [9], [10], [13]) all confirm the Timberwolves' win. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Pistons and Minnesota Timberwolves played their scheduled NBA game on March 30, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. According to multiple verified reports, the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Detroit Pistons with a final score of **123-104**[2][4][6][9][10][13]. The game included a second-quarter brawl that resulted in seven ejections (five players and two coaches), but it was completed without postponement or cancellation[2][6][9][13]. \n\nAnthony Edwards (25 points) and Julius Randle (26 points) led the Timberwolves' comeback after trailing early, while Rudy Gobert contributed 19 points and 25 rebounds[2][4][6]. The Pistons lost key rotation players to ejections, impacting their depth[2][6]. \n\nSince the game concluded with a Timberwolves victory and no cancellation occurred, the market resolves to **p1** (Timberwolves win). \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the occurrence and outcome of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game has already occurred, based on the current timestamp provided. It uses multiple reliable sources to confirm that the Minnesota Timberwolves won the game, which aligns with the resolution condition p1 for a Timberwolves win. The response does not predict future outcomes or speculate but relies on verified facts from credible sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date and occurrence of the event, followed by a detailed examination of the game's outcome from various sources. It correctly concludes that the market should resolve to p1 based on the Timberwolves' victory. The response also checks for any conflicting information and finds none, reinforcing the reliability of the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is directly aligned with the facts verified.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's conditions and uses the specified sources to form its recommendation.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Timberwolves outcome, which is consistent with Perplexity's recommendation of p1.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431311 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:28:31 UTC",
