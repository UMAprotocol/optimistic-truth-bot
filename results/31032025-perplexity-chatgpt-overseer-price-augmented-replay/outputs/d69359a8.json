        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Oakland Athletics vs. Seattle Mariners game on March 29, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Mariners, p2 is Athletics, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on March 29. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game is in the past. The search results mention multiple games in the series. Let me look through the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a March 29 game mentioned in several sources. For example, source [4] from CBS News on March 30, 2025, reports that the Athletics defeated the Mariners 4-2 on Saturday night. Saturday, March 29 would be the day before, so that lines up. Similarly, sources [5], [6], [9], [12], and [13] all confirm the Athletics won 4-2 on March 29. \n\nThe box score in [9] explicitly states the Athletics won 4-2 on March 29. The starting pitchers were Bryce Miller for the Mariners and Osvaldo Bido for the Athletics, which matches the game details in the query. The game was completed, as there's no mention of suspension or postponement. The official outcome from MLB would be an Athletics win. \n\nSince the game was played and completed, and the Athletics won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no indication of a tie or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the result, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Oakland Athletics defeated the Seattle Mariners 4-2 in the MLB game played on March 29, 2025, at T-Mobile Park. Shea Langeliers' two-run homer in the fourth inning proved decisive, while Osvaldo Bido earned the win with five solid innings pitched[4][5][6][9][12]. The Athletics' bullpen held Seattle to 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position, stranding nine baserunners[4][5]. This outcome was officially recorded by Major League Baseball with no indications of postponement, suspension, or incomplete status[4][9].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the outcome of the Oakland Athletics vs. Seattle Mariners game on March 29, 2025, as a win for the Athletics. The response adheres to the instructions by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the date of the event, confirming the game was played and completed, and verifying the winner based on multiple sources. The response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the market: it confirms the game was not postponed, suspended, or ended in a tie, and it identifies the winning team.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p2 for Athletics win) with the verified facts. The details about the game, such as the score and key players, are consistent across sources, providing a strong basis for the recommendation.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response uses a balanced approach by sourcing information from multiple reports and aligns strictly with the facts.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Athletics outcome, which aligns with the Perplexity recommendation (p2). This alignment further validates the accuracy of the response.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and does not require a rerun. It is accurate, logically sound, and aligns with both the user prompt conditions and market signals.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the specified event, adheres to the user prompt instructions, and aligns with market price signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and provides a clear, well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431807 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:36:47 UTC",
