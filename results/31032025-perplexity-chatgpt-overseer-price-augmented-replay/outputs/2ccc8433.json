The ancillary data specifies that if the Jets win, it's p1; if the Canucks win, p2; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 30, so it's already in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles confirm the result. Source [2] mentions the Canucks lost 3-1 to the Jets. Source [3] and [4] both state the Jets won 3-1, with Cole Perfetti scoring a key goal. Source [5] and [6] also report the Jets' 3-1 victory. Additionally, source [7] and [8] corroborate the same scoreline. \n\nAll sources consistently report the Jets as the winners. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Jets). I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align. The final score was 3-1 in favor of Winnipeg, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Vancouver Canucks and Winnipeg Jets on March 30, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET resulted in a **3-1 victory for the Winnipeg Jets**[2][3][4][5][6][8]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Jets' scorers**: Kyle Connor (38th goal of the season), Mason Appleton, and Cole Perfetti (highlight-reel goal)[3][4][8].  \n- **Canucks' lone goal**: Pius Suter opened the scoring in the first period[2][4][7].  \n- **Goaltending**: Connor Hellebuyck made 23 saves for Winnipeg, while Thatcher Demko stopped 24 shots for Vancouver[4][5][6].  \n\nThe Jets maintained their top position in the NHL standings with this win[6], while the Canucks fell six points behind a wild-card spot[7].

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Jets win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response is well-structured and provides a detailed account of the game, including scores by individual players and the performance of the goaltenders, which supports the final outcome. The sources cited in the response are consistent in reporting the Jets as the winners, and there is no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions set out for resolution.\n\nThe response also aligns with the market price signals from Polymarket, where the Jets token is priced at 1, indicating a 100% confidence in the Jets' victory. This further corroborates the accuracy of the Perplexity AI's recommendation.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The logical reasoning is sound, and the verification of the event is thorough, ensuring that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431449 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:30:49 UTC"
