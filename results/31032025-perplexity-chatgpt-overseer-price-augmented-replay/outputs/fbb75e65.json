The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Baltimore Orioles vs. Toronto Blue Jays game scheduled for March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Blue Jays, p2 is Orioles, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's status and result. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game in question has already occurred. Checking the search results, source [3] mentions a Blue Jays win on March 30 with a score of 3-1. Source [6] also states the Orioles lost 3-1 to the Blue Jays that day, and the series was split. Additionally, source [4] and [7] provide the box score and play-by-play, confirming the Blue Jays' victory. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or suspended. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. The official MLB outcome, as per the resolution conditions, is the Blue Jays winning 3-1. There's no mention of the game being incomplete or tied. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Blue Jays). No conflicting information found, so recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays played their scheduled MLB game on March 30, 2025, with the Blue Jays winning 3-1[3][6]. George Springer's two RBIs and Tyler Heineman's solo home run provided the decisive runs for Toronto[3][6], while Chris Bassitt earned the win with 6 innings pitched[6]. The game was completed without suspension or postponement, and the official MLB outcome recorded Toronto as the winner[6][7].\n\nBased on the resolution conditions where p1 corresponds to a Blue Jays victory, this market resolves to **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the outcome of the Baltimore Orioles vs. Toronto Blue Jays game on March 30, 2025, as a win for the Blue Jays with a score of 3-1. The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the game was not postponed, suspended, or incomplete and that it ended in a definitive result within the stipulated time frame.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions set forth in the user prompt, checking for postponement, suspension, and official results. It uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring the recommendation is well-supported.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, aligning perfectly with the ancillary data provided (p1 corresponds to a Blue Jays win).\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has covered all necessary aspects to resolve the market based on the conditions provided.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors the Blue Jays, which aligns with the AI's recommendation of p1. This correlation between the AI's recommendation and market sentiment further validates the accuracy of the response.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its alignment with both the user prompt conditions and market sentiment, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the event's outcome, adheres to the resolution conditions, and aligns with market price signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and adhered strictly to the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743430841 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:20:41 UTC",
