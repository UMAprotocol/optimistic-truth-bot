The ancillary data says p2 is \"Yes\" if they advanced, p1 is \"No\" if they didn't. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for confirmation. Looking through the sources, multiple articles mention Houston's victory over Tennessee in the Elite Eight to reach the Final Four. For example, source [1] states that Houston beat Tennessee 69-50 and is headed to the Final Four. Source [6] and [11] also confirm the win and their advancement. Additionally, source [15] lists all four No. 1 seeds in the Final Four, including Houston. The current date is March 31, 2025, which is after the game dates mentioned (March 30), so the event has occurred. Since the NCAA's official information in the sources confirms Houston's advancement, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). There's no indication of any cancellations or changes, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe University of Houston men's basketball team advanced to the 2025 NCAA March Madness Final Four by defeating the Tennessee Volunteers 69-50 in the Elite Eight on March 30, 2025[1][6][11]. This marks their seventh Final Four appearance in program history and their second under head coach Kelvin Sampson since 2021[1][6]. The Cougars, as the Midwest Region's No. 1 seed, will face No. 1 seed Duke in the national semifinals on April 5, 2025, at the Alamodome in San Antonio[6][11][15]. The game result and Final Four qualification have been widely reported across official NCAA channels and major sports media outlets[1][4][6][11][15].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively analyzes the factual information regarding the University of Houston's advancement to the 2025 NCAA March Madness Final Four, confirming the event occurred as described in the user prompt. The response uses multiple sources to verify the outcome, which aligns with the requirement to base conclusions on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it directly connects the verified event (Houston's victory and advancement to the Final Four) with the resolution condition specified in the ancillary data (p2 for \"Yes\"). The response also correctly identifies that the event has already occurred, given the current date is March 31, 2025, and the event in question took place on March 30, 2025. This is crucial as it adheres to the instruction to check if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp.\n\nThere is no missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's conditions and uses the NCAA's official information as the resolution source, which is specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe alignment with market price signals is also considered, where the market strongly favors a \"Yes\" outcome, which supports the recommendation provided by Perplexity. This alignment adds an additional layer of confidence in the recommendation.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and does not require a rerun. It meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, adherence to instructions, and logical reasoning. The recommendation aligns with the verified facts and the market signals, providing a strong basis for resolving the market with confidence.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event of Houston's advancement to the 2025 Final Four based on reliable sources and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431538 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:32:18 UTC",
