        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Congress will grant Trump more funds for deportations by June 30, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 31, 2025. The deadline is June 30, so there's still time until then. But based on the search results provided, I need to see if any bills have already been passed. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several mentions of Congress passing budget resolutions and continuing resolutions. For example, result [7] mentions a continuing resolution passed on December 20, 2024, funding the government until March 14, 2025. However, result [11] from March 14, 2025, states that Congress passed a full-year CR funding until September 30, 2025, which includes increased funds for ICE detention and deportation. That's after the previous CR expired. \n\nResult [1] and [21] from February 21, 2025, discuss the Senate passing a budget resolution allocating up to $350 billion for deportation efforts. The House was expected to vote on a similar proposal. Then, result [19] from March 15, 2025, says the Senate followed the House in passing a Continuing Resolution that funnels funds towards Trump's $350 billion request. \n\nAdditionally, result [11] explicitly states that the CR passed in March includes at least $430 million more for ICE and $136 million for DOJ related to deportations. This indicates that Congress has already approved increased funding as part of the CR. \n\nSince the deadline is June 30, and the CR passed in March includes new funding, this would meet the resolution condition for \"Yes\" (p2). Even though the CR is a continuing resolution, it's a bill passed by both chambers that includes increased funds for deportations. Therefore, the answer should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe U.S. Congress has already passed legislation allocating significant new funding for deportations as part of fiscal year 2025 budget measures. The Senate approved a budget resolution in February 2025 that includes **$350 billion over 10 years** for immigration enforcement, explicitly funding expanded detention capacity, ICE operations, and deportation infrastructure[1][5][9]. This was followed by a **bipartisan Continuing Resolution (CR)** passed on March 14, 2025, which provides:\n\n- **$430 million in additional FY 2025 funding** for ICE detention beds and deportation logistics[11]\n- **$136 million to the DOJ** to handle increased immigration prosecutions[11]\n- A framework to sustain Trump\u2019s deportation agenda through September 2025[7][19]\n\nThese allocations meet the resolution criteria of \"new or increased funding for deportations\" before the June 30, 2025 deadline. While the Senate\u2019s $350 billion proposal is a multiyear blueprint, the March 2025 CR represents enacted legislation with immediate funding increases. Both chambers passed these measures, with the House approving related bills like the **Laken Riley Act** (requiring detention of migrants accused of crimes) in January 2025[10][14]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Additionally, alignment with market price signals was considered.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event in question (passing of a bill that includes new or increased funding for deportations) has occurred before the specified deadline of June 30, 2025. The response correctly cites the passing of a Continuing Resolution (CR) that includes increased funding for deportations, which aligns with the user prompt's requirement for the market to resolve to \"Yes.\"\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed explanation of the legislative actions taken by Congress, including specific amounts and the purposes for which the funds were allocated. It logically connects these actions to the resolution criteria specified in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event through multiple sources and dates, ensuring that the information is current and relevant to the resolution date. The recommendation to resolve as \"Yes\" (p2) is well-supported by the detailed description of the legislative actions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or significant biases in the response. The information provided is relevant and directly addresses the query without unnecessary deviation.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information from Polymarket strongly favors a \"Yes\" outcome, which aligns with the Perplexity AI's recommendation of p2. This consistency between the AI's analysis and market sentiment further supports the accuracy of the response.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns with both the facts presented and the market signals.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately addresses the user prompt with detailed and relevant information, correctly verifies the occurrence of the event, and aligns with market signals.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-structured, providing a clear and factual basis for the recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431913 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:38:33 UTC",
