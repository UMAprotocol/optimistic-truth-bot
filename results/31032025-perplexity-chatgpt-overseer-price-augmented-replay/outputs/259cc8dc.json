The resolution conditions are clear: \"Yes\" (p2) if an executive order was published on the White House site or through the press pool by the deadline, otherwise \"No\" (p1). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of an executive order signed on March 29. Let's go through each source. \n\nLooking at the dates in the search results: most are from January, February, or March 2025, but none specifically mention March 29. For example, sources [1] and [11] discuss an executive order from March 30 about elections. Source [9] mentions an executive order signed on March 27 related to American history. Source [10] also refers to an order on March 27 about Washington, D.C. \n\nThe latest dates in the search results are March 30 and 31, but March 29 isn't directly referenced. The Littler Mendelson tracker (source [8] and [16]) includes entries up to March 24 and 28, but nothing on March 29. Similarly, the Columbia University source (12) talks about a March 20 order on minerals. \n\nSince there's no mention of an executive order on March 29 in any of the provided sources, and the user specified that the market resolves to \"No\" if nothing is published by 12 PM ET the next day, the answer should be \"No\". The absence of any relevant information in the search results about a March 29 order supports this conclusion.\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results provided, there is no mention of Donald Trump signing an executive order on March 29, 2025. The most recent executive orders referenced in the sources include:\n\n- March 30, 2025: An election-related executive order requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration[1][11]\n- March 27, 2025: Executive orders on American history preservation[9] and Washington D.C. safety[10]\n- March 24, 2025: An order addressing Venezuela sanctions[8][16]\n\nThe search results contain detailed information about executive orders signed in January and February 2025, including immigration reforms[2][15], government efficiency measures[3][6], and trade tariffs[6][14]. However, none of the 19 sources reference any executive action occurring on March 29, 2025.\n\nGiven the resolution criteria requiring publication by 12:00 PM ET on March 30 and the absence of any relevant documentation in the provided materials, this market should resolve to \"No.\"\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The AI checked the specified sources and found no evidence of an executive order being signed on that date. It correctly concluded that the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1) based on the absence of any relevant documentation by the specified deadline.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI systematically checked the relevant dates and sources, confirming that no executive order was signed on March 29, 2025. It adhered to the user prompt's requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence from specified URLs and to resolve the market based on the absence of an executive order by the deadline.\n\nThe verification of the event was aligned with the facts as the AI used the provided URLs and found no mention of an executive order on the specified date. The response did not include any missing information, bias, or errors. It strictly adhered to the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nThe alignment with market price signals is also consistent. The market strongly favors a \"No\" outcome, which matches the AI's recommendation of p1. This alignment further supports the accuracy of the response.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and does not require a rerun. It meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, verification of the event, and alignment with market signals.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzed the event based on the specified sources and correctly concluded that the market should resolve to 'No'.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743431016 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 14:23:36 UTC",
