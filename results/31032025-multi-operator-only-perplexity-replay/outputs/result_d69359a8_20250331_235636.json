The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Mariners, p2 is Athletics, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 29. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nResult [3] is titled \"Seattle Mariners Squander Opportunities in 4-2 Loss Against Athletics\" and dated March 29, 2025. It clearly states the Mariners lost 4-2. Result [5] from baseball-almanac.com also confirms the Athletics won 4-2 on March 29. Other sources like [1], [2], [4], [6], [7], and [8] mention the game's prediction and odds but the actual result is in [3] and [5]. \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or suspended, as per the details. The official MLB outcome would be Athletics winning. Therefore, the resolution should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Oakland Athletics defeated the Seattle Mariners 4-2 in their March 29, 2025 MLB game at T-Mobile Park. Key moments included Shea Langeliers' two-run homer in the fourth inning and Miguel And\u00fajar's RBI single in the sixth, while Seattle stranded multiple runners early. The game was completed without postponement or suspension, with MLB officially recording the Athletics as winners[3][5].\n\nrecommendation: p2"

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle system regarding the MLB game between the Oakland Athletics and the Seattle Mariners on March 29, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the occurrence and outcome of the event through reliable sources, as specified in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the winner of the game as the Oakland Athletics, based on reliable sources cited in the response. The game's outcome aligns with the conditions specified in the user prompt for resolution (p2 for Athletics win). The response does not predict or assume but relies on concrete evidence from the sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions under which different resolutions would apply (e.g., game postponement, suspension, or official outcome) and confirms that none of these conditions except for the official outcome occurred. The game was completed on the scheduled date, and the Athletics were declared the winners, which directly leads to the recommendation of p2.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the recommendation aligns with the verified facts. The use of specific details from the game, such as key moments and scores, further supports the accuracy of the information.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: Although the market price information from Polymarket is listed as unknown, the response does not rely on speculative or unverified information. The recommendation is based solely on the factual outcome of the game.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the system prompt. It provides a clear, accurate, and fact-based resolution to the query without any need for additional attempts or corrections.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the event based on reliable sources and adheres to the conditions specified in the user prompt.

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle system regarding the MLB game between the Oakland Athletics and the Seattle Mariners on March 29, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the occurrence and outcome of the event through reliable sources, as specified in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the winner of the game as the Oakland Athletics, based on reliable sources cited in the response. The game's outcome aligns with the conditions specified in the user prompt for resolution (p2 for Athletics win). The response does not predict or assume but relies on concrete evidence from the sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions under which different resolutions would apply (e.g., game postponement, suspension, or official outcome) and confirms that none of these conditions except for the official outcome occurred. The game was completed on the scheduled date, and the Athletics were declared the winners, which directly leads to the recommendation of p2.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the recommendation aligns with the verified facts. The use of specific details from the game, such as key moments and scores, further supports the accuracy of the information.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: Although the market price information from Polymarket is listed as unknown, the response does not rely on speculative or unverified information. The recommendation is based solely on the factual outcome of the game.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the system prompt. It provides a clear, accurate, and fact-based resolution to the query without any need for additional attempts or corrections.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the event based on reliable sources and adheres to the conditions specified in the user prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743458134 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:55:34 UTC",
