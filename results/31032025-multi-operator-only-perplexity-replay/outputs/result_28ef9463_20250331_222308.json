        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chicago Cubs vs. Arizona Diamondbacks game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Diamondbacks, p2 is Cubs, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and whether it was played as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game in question happened yesterday. Checking the search results, multiple sources like ESPN [9][12], CBS Sports [13], and MLB.com [5][8][16] mention the game took place on March 30. No indications of postponement or cancellation, so the game was played.\n\nNext, determine the official winner. The search results consistently report that the Diamondbacks won. For example, ESPN's recap [9] states the Diamondbacks rallied with an eight-run eighth inning to win 10-6. Similarly, Burn City Sports [11] and CBS Sports [13] confirm the final score as 10-6 in favor of Arizona. The MLB.com video [5] also highlights the Diamondbacks' comeback.\n\nI should check if the game was completed. The detailed play-by-play in the CBS Sports box score [13] and the eighth-inning rally described in multiple sources [5][9][11][14] indicate the game went to completion without suspension. The Diamondbacks' eight-run eighth inning suggests the game was played in full, and the final score is official.\n\nSince the game was completed and the Diamondbacks won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being tied or suspended, so p3 isn't applicable here. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks played their scheduled MLB game on March 30, 2025, at Chase Field in Phoenix. The game was completed without postponement or suspension, with the Diamondbacks winning 10-6 after an eight-run eighth-inning rally[9][11][13]. Key details:\n\n- The Cubs led 6-2 entering the bottom of the 8th inning before Arizona's offensive explosion[9][14]\n- Diamondbacks pitcher Ryne Nelson recorded his first career RBI with a go-ahead single during the rally[9][11]\n- MLB's official box score and multiple verified sources confirm Arizona as the winner[5][9][13]\n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **p1** (Diamondbacks win) as the game was completed on March 30 with an official MLB-recorded outcome favoring Arizona. \n\nrecommendation: p1"

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743452475 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:21:15 UTC",

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743452475 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:21:15 UTC",

The response effectively verifies the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (MLB game between the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks on March 30, 2025) and verifies that it occurred as scheduled without any postponements or cancellations. The outcome of the game is confirmed with multiple reliable sources, and the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt are adhered to, with the market resolving to p1 (Diamondbacks win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a thorough analysis, checking for any possible conditions that could alter the resolution (e.g., game suspension, official completion, tie). It confirms the game was completed and officially recorded, with the Diamondbacks declared the winners. The reasoning is logically structured and leads to a clear, justified conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively uses multiple sources to verify the event's occurrence and outcome. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified facts and the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The information provided is relevant and directly pertains to the resolution of the query.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, hence there is no conflict or alignment issue with market signals. The response remains based solely on the factual outcome of the event.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the query. There is no need for a rerun as the response is complete, accurate, and adheres to all specified instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome based on reliable sources, adheres to the resolution conditions, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses multiple sources for verification, and correctly applies the resolution conditions without any apparent errors or biases.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
