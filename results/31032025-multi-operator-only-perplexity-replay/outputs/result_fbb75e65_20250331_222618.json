The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Blue Jays, p2 is Orioles, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and whether it was played as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game in question happened yesterday. Checking the search results, multiple sources like [1], [4], [8], [9], [11], [12], and [13] mention the March 30 game. \n\nLooking at the box scores and recaps, the final score is consistently reported as Blue Jays 3, Orioles 1. For example, result [4] from ESPN clearly states the Blue Jays won 3-1. Similarly, the YouTube highlights in [8] and [9] confirm the Blue Jays' victory with Taylor Heineman's home run contributing to the win. \n\nI also need to check if the game was completed. The detailed play-by-play in [13] and [14] shows the game went through all nine innings without suspension. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the sources. Since the game was played to completion and the official result is a Blue Jays win, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data.\n\nNo conflicting information exists in the search results. All sources align on the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Baltimore Orioles 3-1 in their March 30, 2025 MLB game at Rogers Centre[1][4][8][9][11][12]. The game was completed as scheduled with no postponements or suspensions, and the outcome was officially recorded by MLB.  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- Toronto's Chris Bassitt recorded 7 strikeouts[8][9]  \n- Taylor Heineman hit a go-ahead home run in the 7th inning[8][9]  \n- Baltimore's Ryan O'Hearn went 2-for-3 with a double and run scored[5]  \n- Final box score showed Toronto with 3 runs on 7 hits vs Baltimore's 1 run on 6 hits[1][10]  \n\nThe market resolves to **p1** (Blue Jays win) as the game concluded normally with Toronto as the official winner.  \n\nrecommendation: p1"

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event in question and confirms that it occurred on the specified date. The outcome of the game is verified through multiple sources, and the response adheres strictly to the user prompt's resolution conditions. The game's outcome (Blue Jays win) aligns with the ancillary data provided (p1 corresponds to a Blue Jays win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for any conditions that might affect the resolution, such as game suspension, postponement, or cancellation. It confirms that the game was completed as scheduled and that the official MLB records declare the Blue Jays as the winners. The reasoning is logical, following the sequence of checks required by the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through credible sources, including ESPN and YouTube highlights, ensuring that the information is reliable and relevant. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is directly based on these verifications.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the prompt without deviating into unrelated details.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, thus it does not offer a conflicting or supporting signal to the recommendation. The response remains unbiased by market speculation, focusing solely on factual outcomes.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the UMA optimistic oracle request. The response is complete, adheres to the instructions, and is based on verified facts without any evident errors or biases.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome based on reliable sources and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743452589 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:23:09 UTC",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743452589 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:23:09 UTC",

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle system regarding the MLB game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Toronto Blue Jays on March 30, 2025, appears to be thorough and well-aligned with the requirements set forth in the system prompt. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event in question and confirms that it occurred on the specified date. The outcome of the game is verified through multiple sources, and the response adheres strictly to the user prompt's resolution conditions. The game's outcome (Blue Jays win) aligns with the ancillary data provided (p1 corresponds to a Blue Jays win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for any conditions that might affect the resolution, such as game suspension, postponement, or cancellation. It confirms that the game was completed as scheduled and that the official MLB records declare the Blue Jays as the winners. The reasoning is logical, following the sequence of checks required by the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through credible sources, including ESPN and YouTube highlights, ensuring that the information is reliable and relevant. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is directly based on these verifications.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the prompt without deviating into unrelated details.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, thus it does not offer a conflicting or supporting signal to the recommendation. The response remains unbiased by market speculation, focusing solely on factual outcomes.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the UMA optimistic oracle request. The response is complete, adheres to the instructions, and is based on verified facts without any evident errors or biases.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome based on reliable sources and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.
