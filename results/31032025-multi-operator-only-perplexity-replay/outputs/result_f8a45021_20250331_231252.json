        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Colorado Rockies vs. Tampa Bay Rays game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to p1 for Rays winning, p2 for Rockies, and p3 (50-50) if the game is postponed, canceled, or not completed by April 1. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game was played and completed on March 30. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the game took place. The box score from FOX Sports [1] and the ESPN recap [10][12] both confirm the Rays won 6-4. The Bleacher Report [7] also mentions the Rays' victory with a final score of 6-4. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't suspended or postponed. The search results don't mention any suspension; instead, they provide detailed stats and highlights, indicating the game was completed. The MLB.com article [15] describes the Rays' offensive plays and their series-clinching win, further confirming the game's completion.\n\nSince the game was played to completion on March 30 and the Rays won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no indication of a tie, postponement, or suspension that would trigger a 50-50 resolution. All sources consistently report the Rays as the winners, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Colorado Rockies 6-4 on March 30, 2025, in a game that concluded without suspension or postponement[1][7][10][12][15]. The Rays' victory was secured through key offensive plays, including Brandon Lowe's two-run homer in the first inning and a four-run sixth inning fueled by infield hits and defensive miscues by the Rockies[15]. The game was declared official under MLB rules, with Taj Bradley earning the win and Pete Fairbanks recording the save[7][10].  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1** (Rays win).  \n\nrecommendation: p1"

The response also correctly aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, recommending a resolution of p1 (Rays win) based on the factual outcome of the game.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking for any possible suspensions, postponements, or cancellations, and confirms that none of these conditions applied. It also correctly identifies that the game was completed on the specified date and was declared official under MLB rules, which is crucial for accurate resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The sources cited (FOX Sports, ESPN, Bleacher Report, MLB.com) are appropriate and reliable for verifying the outcome of a Major League Baseball game. The response also correctly ignores market price information from Polymarket, as it is irrelevant to the factual resolution of the event based on the game's outcome.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the resolution conditions, and logical consistency in the response, there is no need for a rerun or additional verification.

The response effectively verifies the occurrence of the Colorado Rockies vs. Tampa Bay Rays game on March 30, 2025, and confirms the outcome based on multiple reliable sources. The response also correctly aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, recommending a resolution of p1 (Rays win) based on the factual outcome of the game.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking for any possible suspensions, postponements, or cancellations, and confirms that none of these conditions applied. It also correctly identifies that the game was completed on the specified date and was declared official under MLB rules, which is crucial for accurate resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The sources cited (FOX Sports, ESPN, Bleacher Report, MLB.com) are appropriate and reliable for verifying the outcome of a Major League Baseball game. The response also correctly ignores market price information from Polymarket, as it is irrelevant to the factual resolution of the event based on the game's outcome.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the resolution conditions, and logical consistency in the response, there is no need for a rerun or additional verification. The response satisfactorily meets the requirements of the system prompt and provides a clear and accurate resolution recommendation.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using reliable sources, adheres to the resolution conditions, and logically addresses all required aspects of the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event outcome, ensuring a high level of accuracy and reliability in the resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743455490 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:11:30 UTC",
