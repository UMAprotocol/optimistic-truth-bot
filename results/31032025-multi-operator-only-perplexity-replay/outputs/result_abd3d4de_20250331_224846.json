For example, result [3] states, \"Houston is moving on to the Final Four... after a dominant win against Tennessee on Sunday.\" Result [7] mentions the score as 69-50 in favor of Houston, eliminating Tennessee. \n\nSince Tennessee lost in the Elite Eight, they cannot advance to the Final Four.

This aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, which state that the market should resolve to \"No\" if Tennessee is eliminated. The response logically concludes with a recommendation of p1, which corresponds to the market resolving to \"No.\"\n\nThe response is logically sound, as it bases its conclusion on the outcome of a specific event (the Elite Eight game) that directly affects the resolution of the market in question. It correctly ignores any predictions or future events that have not yet occurred, focusing solely on the established facts.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not rely on implied or indirect references and sticks strictly to the event specified in the user prompt. It also correctly uses the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data to guide its recommendation.\n\nThe market price information provided does not influence the resolution since the outcome has already been determined by the event's occurrence, and the market prices are unknown, indicating no strong market sentiment that could contradict the factual outcome.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and does not require a rerun.

It correctly ignores any predictions or future events that have not yet occurred, focusing solely on the established facts.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not rely on implied or indirect references and sticks strictly to the event specified in the user prompt. It also correctly uses the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data to guide its recommendation.\n\nThe market price information provided does not influence the resolution since the outcome has already been determined by the event's occurrence, and the market prices are unknown, indicating no strong market sentiment that could contradict the factual outcome.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and does not require a rerun. It is accurate, adheres to the instructions, and logically concludes based on the verified facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the relevant event, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and logically uses the ancillary data for resolution.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively verifies the event outcome using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743454057 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:47:37 UTC",
