The response adheres strictly to the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts and concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:** The response logically processes the information from various sources to confirm the game's outcome. It provides a detailed account of the game, including key moments and scores by specific players, which supports the final recommendation effectively.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:** The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was neither postponed nor canceled. The alignment of the recommendation with the facts is clear and direct, with p1 being the correct resolution based on the Hurricanes' victory.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:** There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating from the relevant details.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals:** The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, showing \"Unknown\" for both teams. Therefore, there is no market signal to compare against the recommendation.

The response adheres strictly to the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts and concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:** The response logically processes the information from various sources to confirm the game's outcome. It provides a detailed account of the game, including key moments and scores by specific players, which supports the final recommendation effectively.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:** The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was neither postponed nor canceled. The alignment of the recommendation with the facts is clear and direct, with p1 being the correct resolution based on the Hurricanes' victory.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:** There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating from the relevant details.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals:** The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, showing \"Unknown\" for both teams. Therefore, there is no market signal to compare against the recommendation. However, the factual outcome of the game supports the recommendation independently of market signals.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the NHL game based on multiple reliable sources and aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The logical reasoning is sound, and there are no errors or biases detected.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-structured, providing a clear and factual resolution based on the event's outcome. It adheres closely to the system prompt requirements and effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the game's result.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThe response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the query. There is no need for a rerun as the information provided is complete and correctly aligned with the user prompt and system prompt instructions.",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
