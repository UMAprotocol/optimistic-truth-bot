Additionally, the BetMGM article [6] and the Fox Sports prediction [4] both reference the game happening as scheduled without any mention of postponement or cancellation.\n\nThe ancillary data mentions using the official MLB outcome. All sources point to the Giants winning 6-3. There's no indication the game was suspended, postponed, or ended in a tie. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 for the Giants.\n</think>\n\nThe San Francisco Giants defeated the Cincinnati Reds 6-3 on March 30, 2025, in a game that began and concluded as scheduled. Multiple sources confirm the Giants secured the victory, with starting pitcher Robbie Ray earning the win[1][3][5][7].

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the MLB game between the SF Giants and the CIN Reds on March 30, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the occurrence and outcome of the event through multiple reliable sources, aligning with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the winner of the game as the San Francisco Giants with a score of 6-3 against the Cincinnati Reds. This outcome is confirmed by multiple sources, including news articles and YouTube highlights, which are considered reliable. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data to arrive at the correct resolution. It checks for any conditions that might alter the resolution, such as postponement, cancellation, or a tie, and confirms none of these conditions were met.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The event's occurrence and outcome are verified through multiple sources, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with these facts. The response correctly recommends p2, which corresponds to a Giants win as per the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks for any alternative outcomes and confirms the event's status and result through several independent sources.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information is not directly relevant in this case because the token prices are unknown. However, the response does not conflict with any strong market signals, and the recommendation is based on factual evidence rather than market speculation.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the response is satisfactory and does not require improvement. The recommendation is accurate, well-supported by evidence, and adheres strictly to the guidelines provided in the system prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the event based on multiple reliable sources and adheres to the system prompt instructions.

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the MLB game between the SF Giants and the CIN Reds on March 30, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the occurrence and outcome of the event through multiple reliable sources, aligning with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the winner of the game as the San Francisco Giants with a score of 6-3 against the Cincinnati Reds. This outcome is confirmed by multiple sources, including news articles and YouTube highlights, which are considered reliable. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data to arrive at the correct resolution. It checks for any conditions that might alter the resolution, such as postponement, cancellation, or a tie, and confirms none of these conditions were met.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The event's occurrence and outcome are verified through multiple sources, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with these facts. The response correctly recommends p2, which corresponds to a Giants win as per the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks for any alternative outcomes and confirms the event's status and result through several independent sources.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information is not directly relevant in this case because the token prices are unknown. However, the response does not conflict with any strong market signals, and the recommendation is based on factual evidence rather than market speculation.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the response is satisfactory and does not require improvement. The recommendation is accurate, well-supported by evidence, and adheres strictly to the guidelines provided in the system prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the event based on multiple reliable sources and adheres to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
