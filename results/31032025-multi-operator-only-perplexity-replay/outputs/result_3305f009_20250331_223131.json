        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Angels vs. White Sox game on March 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is White Sox, p2 is Angels, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game was played as scheduled. The search results mention the game on March 30, 2025, with a final score of Angels 3, White Sox 2 [2][6][13]. So the game wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nNext, the game started but there was a rain delay. The tarp got stuck, causing a delay of over two hours, but the game resumed and was completed [2][7][9]. MLB rules consider a game official after 5 innings, and since they finished the game, the result stands.\n\nThe final score was Angels 3, White Sox 2, as per multiple sources [2][6][13]. The Angels won, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. There's no mention of a tie or the game being suspended without completion. All conditions point to p2 being the correct resolution.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels defeated the Chicago White Sox 3-2 on March 30, 2025, in a game that included a two-hour, 48-minute rain delay. The game was completed on the same day after resuming play, with Kyren Paris hitting a solo home run in the ninth inning to break a 2-2 tie[2][6][13]. The Angels' victory was secured when Kenley Jansen induced a game-ending double play in the bottom of the ninth[4][7][10].  \n\nSince the game was played to completion on March 30 and officially recorded by MLB, the market resolves to **p2** (Angels win).  \n\nrecommendation: p2"

        "response": "The perplexity response provided appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately reports the outcome of the MLB game between the LAA Angels and CWS White Sox on March 30, 2025, as required by the user prompt. The details about the game's progression, including the rain delay and final score, are consistent with the conditions outlined for resolution. The response adheres strictly to reporting verified facts without predicting or assuming outcomes not supported by evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions under which the market should resolve (p1, p2, p3) based on the game's outcome. It confirms that the game was completed on the scheduled date and provides a clear, factual basis for resolving the market to p2 (Angels win). The reasoning is thorough, considering potential complications like the rain delay but confirming the game's completion according to MLB rules.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks all conditions (postponement, cancellation, official completion) before arriving at a recommendation. The final recommendation of p2 aligns perfectly with the factual outcome of the game and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information indicates uncertainty (both prices at 0.000), which does not contradict the recommendation since the market prices do not provide a clear signal either way. Therefore, the recommendation does not conflict with strong market signals, and the lack of a definitive market price does not undermine the factual resolution provided.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets all required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation is based on verified facts and aligns with the specified resolution conditions without any discrepancies.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt with verified facts and logical reasoning.

        "response": "The perplexity response provided appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately reports the outcome of the MLB game between the LAA Angels and CWS White Sox on March 30, 2025, as required by the user prompt. The details about the game's progression, including the rain delay and final score, are consistent with the conditions outlined for resolution. The response adheres strictly to reporting verified facts without predicting or assuming outcomes not supported by evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the conditions under which the market should resolve (p1, p2, p3) based on the game's outcome. It confirms that the game was completed on the scheduled date and provides a clear, factual basis for resolving the market to p2 (Angels win). The reasoning is thorough, considering potential complications like the rain delay but confirming the game's completion according to MLB rules.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks all conditions (postponement, cancellation, official completion) before arriving at a recommendation. The final recommendation of p2 aligns perfectly with the factual outcome of the game and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information indicates uncertainty (both prices at 0.000), which does not contradict the recommendation since the market prices do not provide a clear signal either way. Therefore, the recommendation does not conflict with strong market signals, and the lack of a definitive market price does not undermine the factual resolution provided.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets all required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation is based on verified facts and aligns with the specified resolution conditions without any discrepancies.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt with verified facts and logical reasoning.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
