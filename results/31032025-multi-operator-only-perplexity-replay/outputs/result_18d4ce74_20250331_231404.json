The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Dallas Stars vs. Seattle Kraken game scheduled for March 29, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Stars win, it's p2; if the Kraken win, p1; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the date. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game in question has already occurred. The search results provided are from March 29 to March 31, 2025. Let me look through the sources to find the game result.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [1][2][4][5][6][7][8] report that the Dallas Stars defeated the Seattle Kraken 5-1 on March 29. For example, source [1] states, \"Dallas Stars clinched a playoff spot in with a 5-1 victory over the Seattle Kraken on Saturday night.\" Similarly, source [6] mentions, \"The Dallas Stars pulled away from the Seattle Kraken for a 5-1 win, clinching a playoff spot for the fourth straight season.\" \n\nAll the sources consistently report the Stars' victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the game was played as scheduled and the Stars won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. The user's current date is after the game date, so there's no issue with the event being in the future. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Dallas Stars defeated the Seattle Kraken 5-1 in their March 29, 2025 matchup at Climate Pledge Arena, as confirmed by multiple game recaps and box scores[1][2][4][5][6][7]. This victory clinched a playoff berth for the Stars while mathematically eliminating the Kraken from postseason contention[4][5]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources.\n\nrecommendation: p2"

        "response": "The perplexity response provided appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Dallas Stars vs. Seattle Kraken game occurred on March 29, 2025, and that the current date is March 31, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The response verifies through multiple sources that the Dallas Stars won the game 5-1, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition that if the Stars win, the market should resolve to \"p2\". The response does not predict future outcomes and relies solely on verified facts, adhering strictly to the system prompt's requirement.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm it is a past event. It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event through multiple reliable sources, ensuring the information is consistent and confirming the Stars' victory. The response is thorough in its verification process, checking for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which there were none.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome accurately. The recommendation of \"p2\" is correctly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where \"p2\" corresponds to a Stars win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response is focused and directly addresses the query based on the event's specific details as outlined in the user prompt.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information indicates uncertainty with unknown prices for both teams. However, since the factual outcome of the game is verified (Stars win), the market price does not impact the factual resolution of the event. The response correctly does not factor in the market price since it aligns with the verified outcome.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the system prompt. It is accurate, complete, and adheres to the instructions provided. Therefore, no rerun is required, and the response can be confidently used.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Dallas Stars vs. Seattle Kraken game, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions without any factual errors or logical inconsistencies.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and checks for any discrepancies regarding postponement or cancellation.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743455573 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:12:53 UTC",
