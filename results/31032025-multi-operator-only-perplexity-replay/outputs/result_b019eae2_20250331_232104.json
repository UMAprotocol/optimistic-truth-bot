        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Houston made the 2025 Final Four based on the provided search results. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if Houston advances, \"No\" (p1) if they're eliminated, and \"p3\" if it's unknown. The current date is March 31, 2025, and the Final Four is scheduled for April 5, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The Final Four is on April 5, which is in the future relative to March 31. But wait, the search results mention that Houston already played in the Elite Eight on March 30 and won against Tennessee. According to sources [1], [3], [5], [10], [12], and [16], Houston defeated Tennessee 69-50 in the Elite Eight, securing their spot in the Final Four. The game was on March 30, which is before the current date of March 31. \n\nSince the Elite Eight is the round before the Final Four, Houston's victory in that game means they've already advanced. The Final Four itself hasn't happened yet (scheduled for April 5), but the question is whether they made it to the Final Four, not whether they won it. The resolution condition is based on advancing, which they have done by winning the Elite Eight. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles confirm Houston's advancement. For example, source [1] states, \"No. 1 seed Houston reached the Final Four for the second time since 2021 with a statement 69-50 win over No. 2 seed Tennessee.\" Similarly, source [10] mentions, \"UH will be back in action against Duke... in San Antonio on Saturday, April 5.\" \n\nSince the event determining their advancement (Elite Eight game) has occurred and they won, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). The Final Four date being in the future doesn't matter here because the market resolves based on whether they advanced, not their performance in the Final Four. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe University of Houston men's basketball team advanced to the 2025 NCAA March Madness Final Four by defeating Tennessee 69-50 in the Elite Eight on March 30, 2025[1][3][10][12][16]. This victory marked Houston's seventh Final Four appearance in program history and their second under head coach Kelvin Sampson[15]. The Cougars' dominant performance included holding Tennessee to 15 first-half points, the lowest by a No. 2 seed in NCAA Tournament history[10].\n\nAs the Final Four games are scheduled for April 5, 2025 (future date relative to the current March 31 timestamp), Houston has already qualified but not yet competed in the national semifinals. The resolution criteria specify advancement to the Final Four as the determining factor, not subsequent results[1][3][12].\n\nrecommendation: p2"

        "response": "The perplexity response provided by the system appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the instructions outlined in the system prompt. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the University of Houston has advanced to the 2025 Final Four by winning their Elite Eight game against Tennessee on March 30, 2025. This is in line with the user prompt's requirement that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Houston advances to the Final Four. The response uses multiple sources to confirm this event, which satisfies the requirement for verification through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically deduces that since Houston won the Elite Eight game, which is the qualifying event for the Final Four, they have indeed advanced, fulfilling the condition set in the ancillary data (p2 for Yes). The explanation is clear and directly addresses the query without unnecessary information.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the Elite Eight game and Houston's victory using multiple sources. It correctly aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts that have been verified.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question and uses appropriate sources to confirm the details.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any price, hence there is no strong market signal to consider for alignment. The response's recommendation of p2 is based solely on the factual information verified from reliable sources, which is appropriate given the lack of market price data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the prompt instructions. The recommendation of p2 is well-supported by verified facts, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4. The response effectively resolves the query based on the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event of Houston advancing to the 2025 Final Four based on their Elite Eight victory, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses multiple sources for verification, and logically deduces the correct resolution based on the event's outcome.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```"

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

        "response": "The perplexity response provided by the system appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the instructions outlined in the system prompt. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the University of Houston has advanced to the 2025 Final Four by winning their Elite Eight game against Tennessee on March 30, 2025. This is in line with the user prompt's requirement that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Houston advances to the Final Four. The response uses multiple sources to confirm this event, which satisfies the requirement for verification through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically deduces that since Houston won the Elite Eight game, which is the qualifying event for the Final Four, they have indeed advanced, fulfilling the condition set in the ancillary data (p2 for Yes). The explanation is clear and directly addresses the query without unnecessary information.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the Elite Eight game and Houston's victory using multiple sources. It correctly aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts that have been verified.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question and uses appropriate sources to confirm the details.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any price, hence there is no strong market signal to consider for alignment. The response's recommendation of p2 is based solely on the factual information verified from reliable sources, which is appropriate given the lack of market price data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the prompt instructions. The recommendation of p2 is well-supported by verified facts, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4. The response effectively resolves the query based on the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event of Houston advancing to the 2025 Final Four based on their Elite Eight victory, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses multiple sources for verification, and logically deduces the correct resolution based on the event's outcome.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
