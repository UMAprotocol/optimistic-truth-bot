The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Nationals, p2 is Phillies, and p3 is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 30. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game is in the past. According to the rules, if the event date is in the past and there's verifiable information, we use that. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game was played. Source [1] from the Southern Maryland Chronicle states the Nationals won 5-1. The ESPN box score [5] also shows Nationals 5, Phillies 1. YouTube highlights [3][4][9] and other articles [6][10] corroborate this result. \n\nThe Phillies were predicted to win by some sources [2][7], but the actual outcome was a Nationals victory. The game wasn't postponed or suspended, as per the detailed play-by-play in the sources. MLB's official outcome would reflect the Nationals as the winners. \n\nSince the game was completed and the Nationals won, the resolution should be p1. No indications of cancellation or suspension, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the outcome, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Nationals played their scheduled MLB game on March 30, 2025, at Nationals Park. The Washington Nationals defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1[1][3][5][9]. Key factors included:\n\n- **Pitching dominance**: Nationals starter Mitchell Parker threw 6.1 scoreless innings with 5 strikeouts[1][3], while Phillies ace Aaron Nola allowed 5 runs (including 2 HRs) in 5.1 innings[1][5].\n- **Offensive highlights**: Josh Bell's 3-run HR (4th inning) and Nathaniel Lowe's 2-run HR (6th inning) provided all 5 Nationals runs[1][5][9].\n- **Late Phillies response**: A 9th-inning RBI single by Rafael March\u00e1n prevented the shutout[1][5].\n\nThe game was completed without suspension or postponement, lasting 2 hours and 33 minutes with 28,075 attendees[1]. Major League Baseball's official box score confirms the Nationals as the winner[5]. \n\nrecommendation: p1"

The sources cited, including the Southern Maryland Chronicle and ESPN, are considered reliable for verifying the event's outcome. The response adheres to the instructions by not predicting future outcomes and focusing solely on the event that has already occurred.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed analysis of the game, including key performances and highlights, which supports the final recommendation. The reasoning is logical, linking the factual outcome of the game directly to the resolution condition (p1 for Nationals win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The event's verification is thorough, with multiple sources confirming the same outcome. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses on the specific event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, hence it does not influence the evaluation of the response. The response remains based on the factual outcome of the event.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no conflicting information that would suggest a need for a different resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743457105 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:38:25 UTC",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743457105 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:38:25 UTC",

        "response": "The perplexity response provided for the UMA optimistic oracle system regarding the outcome of the PHI Phillies vs. WSH Nationals game on March 30, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the occurrence and outcome of the event through multiple reliable sources, and it aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the outcome of the game, with the Washington Nationals winning against the Philadelphia Phillies. The sources cited, including the Southern Maryland Chronicle and ESPN, are considered reliable for verifying the event's outcome. The response adheres to the instructions by not predicting future outcomes and focusing solely on the event that has already occurred.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed analysis of the game, including key performances and highlights, which supports the final recommendation. The reasoning is logical, linking the factual outcome of the game directly to the resolution condition (p1 for Nationals win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The event's verification is thorough, with multiple sources confirming the same outcome. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses on the specific event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not indicate any prices, hence it does not influence the evaluation of the response. The response remains based on the factual outcome of the event.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no conflicting information that would suggest a need for a different resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.
