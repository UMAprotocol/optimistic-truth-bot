The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between Utah and the Chicago Blackhawks scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, the market resolves to \"Utah\" (p2), if the Blackhawks win, it's \"Blackhawks\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 31, 2025, so the game date has already passed. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources ([1], [4], [7]) that recap the game between Utah Hockey Club and the Chicago Blackhawks on March 30. All these sources confirm that the game took place and Utah won 5-2. \n\nNext, I need to verify the final score and outcome. The search results from NHL.com, ESPN, and CBS Sports all report Utah's victory with a score of 5-2. Specifically, [1] mentions Utah's win, key players, and the timeline of the game. [4] and [7] also detail the goals scored by Utah players, including the final goals by Logan Cooley. \n\nSince the game was played and completed, there's no indication of postponement or cancellation. All sources are consistent in reporting the result. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Utah won, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Utah\"). \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The other search results ([2], [3], [5], [6], [8]) discuss unrelated topics like the Utah Lemon Law, past NHL lockouts, and housing issues, which aren't relevant here. The focus is solely on the March 30 game, which is covered in sources [1], [4], and [7]. \n\nNo sources mention any issues with the game being postponed or canceled. The detailed recaps confirm the game happened as scheduled, with a clear outcome. Therefore, the resolution is straightforward based on the ancillary data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Utah Hockey Club and the Chicago Blackhawks on March 30, 2025, concluded with a **5-2 victory for Utah** [1][4][7]. Key moments included Alexander Kerfoot\u2019s three-point performance (1 goal, 2 assists) and Mikhail Sergachev\u2019s goal and assist, while Karel Vejmelka made 27 saves [1][7]. Utah scored four unanswered goals after trailing 2-1 in the second period, securing the win [4].  \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and completed without postponement or cancellation, the market resolves to **p2 (\"Utah\")** based on the ancillary data\u2019s resolution conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p2"

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (NHL game between Utah and the Chicago Blackhawks on March 30, 2025) and confirms that it has occurred as scheduled, which is crucial since the event's occurrence is a day before the current timestamp. The response uses multiple reliable sources to verify the outcome of the game, which Utah won. This aligns perfectly with the system's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources to conclude that the market should resolve to p2 (\"Utah\"), as Utah won the game. The response checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and finds none, which is a necessary step to ensure the correct resolution path is followed.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is based on concrete evidence. This is in strict adherence to the system's requirement to base decisions on established facts.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the relevant event and disregards unrelated information, which is critical for maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the resolution.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not show any prices for the tokens, indicating uncertainty in the market. However, since the factual resolution of the event is clear (Utah won), the market prices do not impact the resolution recommendation in this case.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the critical requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no conflicting information that would suggest a need for a different resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple reliable sources, aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, and logically processes the information to provide a correct resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and adheres strictly to the system's requirements for factual accuracy and evidence-based resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```"

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743454645 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:57:25 UTC",

This is in strict adherence to the system's requirement to base decisions on established facts.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the relevant event and disregards unrelated information, which is critical for maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the resolution.\n\n5. **Alignment with Market Price Signals**: The market price information provided does not show any prices for the tokens, indicating uncertainty in the market. However, since the factual resolution of the event is clear (Utah won), the market prices do not impact the resolution recommendation in this case.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the critical requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no conflicting information that would suggest a need for a different resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple reliable sources, aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, and logically processes the information to provide a correct resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and adheres strictly to the system's requirements for factual accuracy and evidence-based resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743454645 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 20:57:25 UTC",
