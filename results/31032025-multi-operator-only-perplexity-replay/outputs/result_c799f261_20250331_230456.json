The ancillary data specifies that if the Timberwolves win, it's p1; Pistons win, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game occurred on March 30, with multiple sources [1][2][4][5][7][10][12] detailing the outcome. The Timberwolves won 123-104. So the game wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nNext, confirm the final score. Sources like [1] and [5] explicitly state the Timberwolves' victory. The fight during the game led to ejections but didn't cancel the match. The game continued after the incident, and Minnesota pulled ahead in the third quarter. \n\nSince the game was completed, the resolution depends on the winner. All sources agree the Timberwolves won, so the market should resolve to p1. No indication of cancellation or postponement, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Pistons vs. Minnesota Timberwolves NBA game scheduled for March 30, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET was completed as planned. The Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Detroit Pistons with a final score of **123-104**[1][5][10]. The game included a second-quarter brawl resulting in seven ejections (five players and two coaches), but play resumed after a 10-minute review[2][7][12]. \n\nKey details:\n- **Timberwolves' performance**: Anthony Edwards (25 points) and Julius Randle (26 points) led Minnesota's comeback after trailing early[1][4].\n- **Game continuity**: Despite the mid-game altercation, the match concluded without cancellation or postponement[1][5][10].\n- **Post-game status**: Both teams proceeded to their next scheduled games (Pistons at Oklahoma City on March 31, Timberwolves at Denver on April 1)[1][5].\n\nSince the game was neither postponed nor canceled, and the Timberwolves secured a verified victory, the market resolves to **p1** (Timberwolves win). \n\nrecommendation: p1"

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743454965 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-31 21:02:45 UTC",
