        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said the word \"tariff\" during his March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference, including both the introductory statement and the Q&A. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of \"tariff\" by Powell. The search results include transcripts and news articles about the March 19 press conference. \n\nLooking at result [2], it's a blog post highlighting Powell's comments. It mentions he discussed tariffs as a factor in inflation expectations. The transcript excerpts show Powell saying people in surveys are pointing to tariffs, and he mentions tariffs affecting core CPI inflation. \n\nResult [5] is a rough transcript of Powell's opening statement. In the Q&A section, Powell responds to a question about tariffs, stating that some inflation is due to tariffs and that forecasters include tariff impacts in their models. He uses the word \"tariffs\" multiple times here.\n\nResult [9] is the official transcript of the press conference. On page 18, Powell explicitly says, \"We know that tariffs are coming in and all forecasters have tariff inflation affecting core CPI inflation.\" He uses both \"tariff\" and \"tariffs.\"\n\nAdditionally, results [6], [7], [11], and [13] are news videos and articles confirming that Powell discussed tariffs during the press conference, attributing part of the inflation to them. \n\nThe FOMC statement in result [10] doesn't mention tariffs, but the resolution criteria include the Q&A session, where Powell did use the term. Since the word \"tariff\" was spoken multiple times in both singular and plural forms during the press conference, the condition for resolving to Yes (p2) is met. There's clear evidence from multiple sources, including direct transcripts, that Powell used the word. No ambiguity here, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nJerome Powell did use the word \"tariff\" multiple times during his March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference, including both the introductory statement and Q&A session. In the official transcript, Powell explicitly stated:  \n- \"People who fill out surveys...are pointing to tariffs\" [2][5]  \n- \"A good part of it is coming from tariffs\" [5][9]  \n- \"All forecasters have tariff inflation affecting core CPI inflation\" [9]  \n\nThe term appeared in both singular and plural forms (\"tariff\" and \"tariffs\") across different contexts, including discussions about inflation expectations and economic forecasts. Video evidence from multiple news outlets corroborates this usage [6][7][11][13].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909130 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:25:30 UTC",
