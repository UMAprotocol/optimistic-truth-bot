        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Western Michigan vs. Kent State basketball game played on March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Kent State wins, it's p1; if Western Michigan wins, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 13) is in the past. No need to worry about postponement or cancellation now. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Results [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [12], [14] all mention the March 13 game. The scores from these sources consistently state Kent State won 73-66. For example, result [3] says \"Kent State Men's Basketball (22-10) held off the Broncos... final score of 73-66.\" Similarly, [7] from CBS Sports reports \"Kent State beats Western Michigan 73-66.\" \n\nI should cross-verify to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources agree on the score and outcome. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The user's query includes a URL, but the instructions say to rely on all provided search results. However, even if focusing on the first result, [1] is a different game on March 4 where Kent State won 77-76, but that's a regular-season game, not the March 13 tournament game in question. The relevant game is the March 13 MAC quarterfinal, which Kent State won 73-66 as per multiple sources. \n\nSince the event occurred, and Kent State won, the resolution should be p1. No ambiguity here. All sources confirm the result, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe March 13, 2025, MAC Tournament quarterfinal basketball game between Western Michigan and Kent State concluded with **Kent State winning 73-66**[3][6][7][9][12][14]. Multiple sources confirm the Golden Flashes held off a second-half comeback attempt by the Broncos, advancing to the semifinals with this victory.  \n\n### Key Details:  \n- **Final Score**: Kent State 73, Western Michigan 66[3][7][9]  \n- **Game Context**: This was a neutral-site tournament game in Cleveland, with Kent State entering as the No. 3 seed and Western Michigan as the No. 6 seed[6][11].  \n- **Critical Moments**:  \n  - Kent State built an 18-point halftime lead (43-25) behind a 13-0 first-half run and strong bench scoring[3][6][9].  \n  - Western Michigan cut the deficit to two points (55-53) in the second half but could not overtake the Golden Flashes[6][12].  \n- **Statistical Highlights**:  \n  - Kent State\u2019s Marquis Barnett led all scorers with 18 points, including four three-pointers in the first half[3][7][9].  \n  - Western Michigan\u2019s Owen Lobsinger scored a team-high 16 points off the bench[12].  \n\n### Resolution:  \nSince the game was played as scheduled and Kent State won, the market resolves to **p1 (Kent State)** per the ancillary data conditions[3][7][14].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
