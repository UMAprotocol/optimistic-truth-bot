The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Washington Capitals vs. Winnipeg Jets game on March 25, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Jets win, it's p1; if the Capitals win, p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 26, 2025, so the game happened on March 25, which is in the past. That means I need to verify the outcome using the provided sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [7], [8], [9]) report that the Jets won 3-2 in overtime. Nikolaj Ehlers scored the winning goal in OT. The Capitals' Ovechkin scored his 889th goal, but the team lost. Since the Jets won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also need to check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources confirm the game took place as scheduled, so no issues there. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 for the Jets' victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Capitals and Winnipeg Jets played their scheduled NHL game on March 25, 2025, with the Jets winning 3-2 in overtime[1][2][3][7][8][9]. Nikolaj Ehlers scored the game-winning goal 1:28 into overtime, securing Winnipeg's playoff berth[1][3][7]. Alex Ovechkin scored his 889th career goal for Washington during regulation[1][2][8].\n\n**Key details confirming resolution:**\n- The game concluded with a decisive overtime result\n- No indications of postponement or cancellation appear in any reports\n- All sources explicitly state Winnipeg earned the victory\n\n**Resolution recommendation:**  \nThe Jets won the game, triggering the p1 resolution condition as defined in the ancillary data.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

There is no indication of the game being postponed or canceled, which was also verified.\n\nThe recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the facts as the Jets won the game. The response does not show any missing information, bias, or errors.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
