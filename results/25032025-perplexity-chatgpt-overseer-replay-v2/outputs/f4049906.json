        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"ETF\" or \"Exchange Traded Fund\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he used those exact terms, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The ancillary data specifies that any usage in the main speech or Q&A right before/after counts, and the resolution source is the video of the speech. The updates mention that a video address counts, so even though it's pre-recorded, it's still valid.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump's speech on March 20. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [4] mentions Trump's pre-recorded speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. It says he emphasized support for crypto but didn't announce new executive actions. The key points listed don't include \"ETF\" or \"Exchange Traded Fund.\" \n\nResult [9] is a transcript of Trump's speech. Scanning through it, he talks about dominating crypto, creating a Bitcoin reserve, and regulatory changes. The terms \"ETF\" or \"Exchange Traded Fund\" aren't present here. \n\nResult [16] states that Trump's speech at the summit didn't include new policies and mostly reiterated previous plans. It specifically notes he didn't announce new crypto policies, which aligns with not mentioning ETFs. \n\nResult [13] is a YouTube transcript snippet. The user mentions Trump's speech, but the provided text doesn't show him saying \"ETF\" or \"Exchange Traded Fund.\" \n\nOther results like [1], [3], [5], [7] discuss Trump Media partnering with Crypto.com to launch ETFs, but these are separate announcements, not part of his March 20 speech. \n\nThe key here is that the query is specifically about the speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20. While Trump has been involved in ETF-related initiatives, those are separate from the speech in question. The transcript and summaries of the speech don't mention the required terms. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did not say \"ETF\" or \"Exchange Traded Fund\" during his March 20, 2025 Digital Asset Summit speech. Analysis of the speech transcript[9][16] and related summaries[4][13] confirms no usage of these terms in any context, including plural/possessive forms. While Trump discussed crypto reserves, regulatory changes, and Bitcoin dominance[9][15], the specific phrases \"ETF\" or \"Exchange Traded Fund\" were absent from his remarks.\n\nThe resolution conditions specify that only statements made during the main speech or its immediate Q&A qualify[ancillary_data]. Subsequent announcements about Trump Media's ETF partnerships[1][3][5][7] occurred after March 20 and are unrelated to the speech itself. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a breakdown of the evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event in question is Donald Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. It correctly notes that the resolution hinges on whether Trump used the terms \"ETF\" or \"Exchange Traded Fund\" during his speech. The response adheres to the instruction to use the video of the speech as the resolution source and correctly applies the conditions that only statements made during the main speech or its immediate Q&A qualify.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with a clear understanding of the query and followed by a detailed examination of multiple sources, including a transcript and summaries of the speech. It methodically checks for the presence of the terms \"ETF\" or \"Exchange Traded Fund\" and confirms their absence, leading to a well-supported conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the facts gathered from these sources. It correctly concludes that Trump did not mention the specified terms during his speech, leading to a recommendation of p1 (No).\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The analysis covers the necessary aspects of the query and uses the specified sources effectively.\n\nGiven the thorough analysis and adherence to the prompt requirements, the response is satisfactory and reliable for resolving the query. The recommendation aligns with the ancillary data and user prompt conditions, confirming that the event was analyzed correctly and the terms in question were not used by Trump during the specified speech.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzes the event, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and provides a well-supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the absence of the specified terms in Trump's speech, leading to a correct resolution recommendation of p1.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908713 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:18:33 UTC",
