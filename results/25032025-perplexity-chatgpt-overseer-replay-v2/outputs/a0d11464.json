        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin closed above $89,000 on March 14, 2025, specifically looking at the Binance BTCUSDT 1-minute candle at 12:00 noon ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any data on March 14. Let's go through each source. \n\nSearch result [1] from March 14 mentions a current price of $84,594.00, with a high of $85,256 and low of $80,109. That's below $89k, so that's a point towards No. \n\nResult [3] and [4] both from March 14 show the BTC price at $81,974.37, with analysis indicating a bearish trend. The high isn't near $89k. \n\nResult [5] on March 14 also talks about a bearish weekly close, predicting a decline. The price mentioned is around 84k-85k resistance, still below 89k. \n\nResult [6] from March 16 shows the 24-hour high as $85,136.00, which is still under the target. \n\nLooking at the historical data in result [13], March 14's close is listed as 83.98K (which is $83,980), and the high for that day was $85.32K. Both are below $89k. \n\nResult [16] is the Binance trade page, but the current price shown there is from the present date (March 25), which is irrelevant here. \n\nAll the relevant data points from March 14 indicate that the highest price was around $85,256, and the close was around $83,980. None of the sources mention a price reaching $89,000 on that day. \n\nSince the resolution condition requires the close to be at least $89,000.01, and all evidence points to the price being significantly lower, the answer should resolve to No, which is p1.\n</think>\n\nBitcoin did not close above $89,000 in the specified Binance BTCUSDT 1-minute candle on March 14, 2025. The highest price observed in the relevant timeframe was $85,256, with the closing price at $83,980[1][3][13]. These values are below the $89,000.01 threshold required for a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nKey data points:\n- March 14 analysis showed BTC trading between $80,109-$85,256[1]\n- Multiple technical analyses from March 14 indicated bearish momentum with resistance levels below $85,500[3][4][5]\n- Historical price tables confirm the March 14 closing price at $83,980[13]\n\nThe resolution conditions specify p2 (\"Yes\") only applies if the close price reaches $89,000.01 or higher, which was not achieved. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies the relevant data points from the provided URL and other sources, confirming that the price did not reach the required threshold of $89,000.01.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources, comparing the highest and closing prices on the specified date against the threshold needed for a \"Yes\" resolution.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934290 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:24:50 UTC"
