The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Golden Knights vs. Red Wings game scheduled for March 16, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Red Wings win, it's p1; if the Golden Knights win, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game in question was on March 16, so it's already in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, multiple articles confirm the result. Source [1] states the Red Wings won 3-0. Source [4] also mentions the Red Wings' 3-0 victory with Mrazek's shutout. Source [7] from ESPN corroborates the same score. Additionally, sources [6], [8], and [9] all report the Red Wings' 3-0 win. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and not postponed or canceled, and the Red Wings won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources, so p3 isn't applicable. All the evidence points to a clear Red Wings victory, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Vegas Golden Knights and Detroit Red Wings on March 16, 2025, concluded with a **3-0 victory for the Detroit Red Wings**[1][4][7]. This outcome was confirmed by multiple sources, including detailed recaps highlighting Petr Mrazek\u2019s shutout performance and Detroit\u2019s three goals from Albert Johansson, Lucas Raymond, and Marco Kasper[6][8][9]. The game was played as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, and no evidence suggests unresolved disputes about the result.  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **p1 (Red Wings)** based on their confirmed victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a win by the Red Wings corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the current date against the date of the event, confirming that the event is in the past, and then proceeding to verify the outcome through multiple reliable sources. The response cites specific sources that corroborate the Red Wings' victory, ensuring that the information is verified and factual. There is no indication of bias, missing information, or errors in the response.\n\nThe recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the facts as verified by the sources and the conditions outlined in the ancillary data. The response also adheres to the instructions by not predicting future outcomes or considering events that have not occurred. It strictly analyzes the factual information about the event that has already happened.\n\nGiven the thorough verification and alignment with the user prompt and ancillary data, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and provided a clear, factual resolution based on the verified information.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906967 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:49:27 UTC"
