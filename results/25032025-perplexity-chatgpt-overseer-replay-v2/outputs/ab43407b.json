The ancillary data specifies that if the Knicks win, it's p1; Mavericks win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 26, 2025, which is after the game date (March 25). So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game result. Source [1] states the Knicks defeated the Mavericks 128-113. Source [2] mentions Josh Hart breaking a Knicks record in the win. Source [3] also confirms the Mavericks lost to the Knicks, with Anunoby scoring 35 points. Source [5] and [8] reiterate the Knicks' victory with the same score. \n\nAll sources consistently report the Knicks as the winner. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since the Knicks won, the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Knicks defeated the Dallas Mavericks 128-113 in their March 25, 2025 matchup at Madison Square Garden[1][3][5][8]. Multiple sources confirm the Knicks secured the victory through strong performances from OG Anunoby (35 points), Karl-Anthony Towns (26-point triple-double), and Josh Hart (triple-double that broke a franchise record)[1][2][8]. The Mavericks' Naji Marshall scored a career-high 38 points but couldn't overcome New York's second-half surge where they outscored Dallas 60-45[3][8].\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled on March 25 with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1][4][6][7]. With the Knicks winning decisively, the market resolves according to the ancillary data's defined outcome for a Knicks victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
