        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Trump declassified JFK files by April 29, 2025. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the deadline is about a month away. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Looking through them, several sources mention Trump signing executive orders in January 2025 to declassify JFK, RFK, and MLK assassination files. For example, sources [1], [2], [5], [7], [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], and [15] all indicate that Trump took action early in his term, specifically within the first 100 days. \n\nThe key points from these sources are:\n- On January 23, 2025, Trump signed an executive order directing the release of all JFK assassination records. \n- The order required a plan within 15 days for JFK files and 45 days for RFK and MLK files. \n- By March 18, 2025, Trump announced the release of 80,000 pages of JFK documents without redactions, as per source [4] and [7]. \n- Source [7] from CBS News on March 20, 2025, confirms that 80,000 pages were released, with some documents previously redacted now fully available. \n\nThe market's resolution condition is based on whether declassification happened by April 29, 2025. Since the documents were already released in March, well before the deadline, the answer should be \"Yes\". The ancillary data specifies that announcements without implementation don't count, but here the declassification was actually carried out, as evidenced by the National Archives releasing the files. \n\nI need to ensure that the declassification was completed, not just announced. The sources, especially [7], mention the release of documents in March, which is within the timeframe. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump fulfilled the market's resolution conditions by declassifying JFK assassination files through two key actions:\n\n1. **Executive Order on January 23, 2025**  \n   Trump signed an order mandating full release of JFK records within 15 days and RFK/MLK records within 45 days, declaring withholding \"not in the public interest\" [1][2][9][11][12][14]. This reversed prior Biden-era delays [1][5][9].\n\n2. **Document Release by March 20, 2025**  \n   The National Archives released 80,000 pages of JFK files with no redactions, including:\n   - Previously redacted CIA surveillance details about Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City [7]\n   - IRS records and technical operational reports [7]\n   - Unredacted versions of 1,123 documents (\u224833% of remaining withheld material) [7]\n\nThe declassification occurred **6 weeks before the April 29 deadline**, with implementation confirmed through:\n- Official government statements [1][2][5][9][14]\n- Primary source document releases via National Archives [7]\n- Multiple credible news reports verifying the release [4][7][13]\n\nSince the market specifies that announcements must be implemented by April 29, 2025, and the declassification was both announced **and executed** within the timeframe, the resolution conditions are met. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate and complete in addressing the user prompt regarding the declassification of JFK files by Donald Trump. The response effectively uses the information provided in the user prompt and aligns with the resolution conditions specified therein.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the user prompt's instructions and conditions. It confirms that Trump signed an executive order and that the documents were released before the specified deadline, which meets the market's resolution condition of actual declassification by April 29, 2025.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, detailing the executive order's signing and the subsequent release of documents. It provides specific dates and actions that corroborate the fulfillment of the conditions set out in the market description. The response also correctly identifies that the event is not a future event relative to the current timestamp, thus appropriately resolving the query with a recommendation of p2.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event through multiple sources cited in the narrative, ensuring that the declassification not only was announced but also implemented. This aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which requires actual implementation rather than just an announcement.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response thoroughly covers the necessary details to make an informed resolution recommendation.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for resolving queries in UMA's optimistic oracle system.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907006 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:50:06 UTC",
