        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Blue Jackets vs. Islanders game on March 24, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Blue Jackets win, it's p2, and if the Islanders win, it's p1. The game was scheduled for March 24 at 7:30 PM ET, which is before the current date of March 25, 2025. So first, I need to confirm the game's outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]) report that the game went into a shootout after a 3-3 tie in regulation and overtime. The Columbus Blue Jackets won the shootout with Adam Fantilli scoring the only goal. The final result is listed as a 4-3 shootout victory for Columbus. \n\nI need to check if a shootout win counts as a win for the purposes of this market. In NHL rules, a shootout victory is considered a win for the team, so Columbus would be the official winner. The ancillary data doesn't specify excluding shootouts, so the market should resolve based on the official result. \n\nAdditionally, there was a disallowed goal for the Islanders in the final seconds of regulation, which was upheld after review. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so the resolution conditions for p3 (50-50) don't apply. All sources confirm the Blue Jackets' win, so the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets defeated the New York Islanders 4-3 in a shootout on March 24, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. The game concluded with Adam Fantilli scoring the lone shootout goal after regulation and overtime ended 3-3. A controversial disallowed goal by Kyle Palmieri with 9.6 seconds remaining in regulation was upheld via video review, preserving the tie[1][3][6][8]. \n\nPer NHL rules, shootout victories count as official wins. The ancillary data specifies resolution p2 (\"Blue Jackets\") for a Columbus win without excluding shootout outcomes. The game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][4][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The event's occurrence and outcome are verified with multiple sources, ensuring the reliability of the information.\n   - The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided, where p2 corresponds to a Blue Jackets win.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:\n   - There is no missing information relevant to the resolution of the query.\n   - The response shows no bias and strictly adheres to the facts and the user prompt conditions.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the resolution conditions, and logical completeness of the response, the recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (\"Blue Jackets\") is well-supported and accurate.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources, adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the established facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and leaves no room for ambiguity regarding the event's outcome and its implications for the market resolution.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
