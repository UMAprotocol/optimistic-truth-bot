The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether those exact terms were used by Trump during that specific event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key here is to look for any mention of Trump using \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during the press conference on March 12. Let's go through the relevant sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the meeting between Trump and Martin on March 12, 2025. For example, source [1] is a video of their meeting, and the transcript in [12] includes Trump's remarks. In [12], Trump talks about economic issues, regulations, and other topics but doesn't mention AI. \n\nOther sources like [4] and [8] discuss Trump's AI-related announcements, but those are from January 2025 regarding the Stargate project with tech companies. Those events are separate from the March 12 press conference with Martin. \n\nSources [5], [9], [11], [15], and [18] detail the March 12 meeting, focusing on trade, tariffs, and the St. Patrick's Day celebration. None of these mention Trump using the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during that specific press conference. \n\nThe transcript in [12] and the video in [13] (which is the same event) don't show any usage of those terms. Trump's discussions were about trade deficits, immigration, and Ukraine, not AI. \n\nAdditionally, the updates in the query specify that the resolution is based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. The provided sources covering that event don't indicate any mention of AI by Trump. \n\nSince all the relevant sources from the March 12 event don't include the terms in question, the answer should resolve to \"No\". There's no evidence in the search results that Trump used \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during that press conference.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

It accurately states that the resolution of the market depends on whether Trump mentioned \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during this specific event. The response adheres to the instruction to base the resolution on verified facts from the event.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking multiple sources for any mention of the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during the event. It correctly concludes that since these terms were not mentioned according to the sources reviewed, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The response is thorough in examining relevant sources and dismissing unrelated mentions of AI in other contexts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and examines the content of the event through multiple sources, including videos and transcripts. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" aligns with the facts gathered from these sources, which confirm that Trump did not use the specified terms during the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response effectively uses the updates provided in the user prompt to refine its analysis, ensuring that the resolution is based on the specific event mentioned.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation aligns with the established facts about the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the query based on the event specifics and available verified sources. It adheres to the instructions and logically concludes based on the evidence provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm the absence of the terms 'AI' or 'Artificial Intelligence' during the event, leading to a correct resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
