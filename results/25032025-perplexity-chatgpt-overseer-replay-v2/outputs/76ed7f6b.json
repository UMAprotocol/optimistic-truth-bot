        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a betting market based on the outcome of the Boise State vs. San Diego State game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 5:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Boise State wins, the market resolves to \"Boise State\" (p2), if San Diego State wins, it's \"San Diego State\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the event should have already happened. Let's look through the search results to confirm the game's outcome.\n\nSearch result [1] from broncosports.com details that Boise State defeated San Diego State 62-52 on March 13 in the Mountain West Championship quarterfinals. This is a primary source from Boise State's official athletics site, which is reliable. The article mentions the date, time, and score, aligning with the scheduled game. \n\nSearch result [6] from SI.com also confirms the outcome, stating San Diego State lost to Boise State 62-52. It notes that the Aztecs led at halftime but were outscored in the second half. This corroborates the result from the first source.\n\nAdditionally, search result [7] from SI.com's Boise State section discusses the game's implications for the NCAA Tournament, further confirming the game took place and Boise State's victory. \n\nNow, checking if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game happening on March 13 as scheduled. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation in the search results. The house rules from search result [3] and [8] discuss scenarios for postponed or canceled games, but since the game was played, those don't apply here.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that a Boise State win resolves to p2. Both teams played the game, and Boise State won, so the market should resolve to p2. There's no conflicting information in the sources, and all point to a clear outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Boise State Broncos defeated the San Diego State Aztecs 62-52 in the Mountain West Conference Tournament quarterfinals on March 13, 2025, as scheduled[1][6]. The game was played at Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, with Boise State overcoming an 11-point first-half deficit and holding San Diego State to 19 second-half points[1][6]. Key contributors included Alvaro Cardenas (16 points) and Tyson Degenhart (14 points) for Boise State, while Nick Boyd led all scorers with 20 points for San Diego State[1][6].\n\n**Key details confirming resolution:**\n- The game occurred on its scheduled date (March 13) and time (5:30 PM ET)[1][2][6]\n- No postponement or cancellation was reported[1][3][6][8]\n- Boise State's victory was decisive and verified through multiple sources[1][6][7]\n\nBased on the resolution conditions and verified outcome:  \n`recommendation: p2`",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924949 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:49:09 UTC"
