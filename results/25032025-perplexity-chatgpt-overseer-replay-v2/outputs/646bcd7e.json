The ancillary data specifies that if Illinois wins, it's p1; Xavier, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 21, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 25, 2025. So the event has already occurred. Now, need to verify the outcome from the search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] states Illinois won 86-73. Source [2] also mentions Illinois' victory with the same score. Sources [5], [7], and [8] all report Illinois as the winner. There's consistent mention of key players like Will Riley and Dailyn Swain's career-high points for Xavier, but the final score is clear. \n\nNo sources indicate the game was postponed or canceled. All results discuss the game as having taken place on March 21. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (Illinois win). No conflicting information found. The answer is straightforward based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Xavier and Illinois occurred on March 21, 2025, as scheduled. Illinois defeated Xavier 86-73 in the NCAA Tournament First Round[1][2][5][7][8]. Key factors in the outcome included Illinois' 18/18 free throw performance, 45-25 rebounding advantage, and four double-digit scorers led by Will Riley's 22 points[2][5][7]. Xavier's Dailyn Swain scored a career-high 27 points but couldn't overcome Illinois' consistent offensive production[1][5].\n\nThe game was completed without postponement or cancellation, meeting all conditions for resolution under the ancillary data terms. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907125 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:52:05 UTC",
