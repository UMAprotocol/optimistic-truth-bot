The user wants to know whether the market resolves to Denmark, Portugal, or 50-50 based on the UEFA Nations League quarterfinal between Denmark and Portugal. The ancillary data specifies that if Denmark advances, it's p2 (Denmark), if Portugal advances, p1 (Portugal), and if canceled/postponed beyond Dec 31, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The second leg was played on March 23, 2025, as per the search results. The first leg was on March 20, 2025, where Denmark won 1-0. The second leg was on March 23, where Portugal won 5-2 after extra time, making the aggregate 5-3 in favor of Portugal. \n\nLooking at the sources, especially [4] and [13], both mention Portugal's victory in the second leg, leading them to the semifinals. The official UEFA article [4] states that Portugal won 5-2 in extra time, and the aggregate was 5-3. The Arab News article [13] confirms the same result. \n\nSince the match wasn't canceled or postponed beyond the specified date, the resolution isn't p3. The result is clear: Portugal advanced. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Portugal). I need to make sure there's no conflicting information. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nPortugal advanced to the next round of the 2024\u201325 UEFA Nations League after defeating Denmark 5-3 on aggregate in their quarterfinal tie. The first leg on March 20, 2025, ended in a 1-0 victory for Denmark, with Rasmus H\u00f8jlund scoring the decisive goal[1][14]. However, Portugal overturned the deficit in the second leg on March 23, winning 5-2 after extra time in Lisbon. Key moments included Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s rebound goal and substitute Francisco Trinc\u00e3o\u2019s two late strikes, which secured Portugal\u2019s progression to the semifinals against Germany[4][13][15].\n\nThe match was not canceled or postponed, and the result was confirmed through official UEFA sources and match reports[4][13]. \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929032 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:57:12 UTC"
