The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the NHL game between the Nashville Predators and St. Louis Blues on March 23, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if the Blues win, it's p1; if the Predators win, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is two days after the game date. So the game should have happened. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Source [1] is a game recap from March 24, 2025, titled \"Blues beat Predators 4-1 to extend winning streak to six games.\" The article details the Blues' victory with goals from Kyrou, Schenn, Texier, and Faulk, and mentions Binnington's 29 saves. Source [4] and [7] also confirm this result, with [4] being another recap and [7] a prediction that the Blues had a 60% chance to win, which they did. \n\nOther sources like [5] and [6] discuss earlier games between these teams, such as March 18 and December 2024, but those are not relevant to the March 23 game. Sources [10] and [12] provide pre-game predictions, but the actual result is covered in [1], [4], and [7]. \n\nSince multiple credible sources confirm the Blues won 4-1 on March 23, the resolution should be p1 (Blues). There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for resolving to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe St. Louis Blues defeated the Nashville Predators 4-1 on March 23, 2025, extending their winning streak to six games. Key contributors included Jordan Kyrou (30th goal of the season), Robert Thomas (three assists), and Jordan Binnington (29 saves). The Blues controlled the game with power-play goals from Alexandre Texier and Justin Faulk, while Nashville's Filip Forsberg scored their lone goal[1][4].\n\nThis outcome aligns with pre-game predictions that gave the Blues a 60% win probability based on their offensive momentum and Nashville's defensive struggles[7][10]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the verified sources.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906641 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:44:01 UTC"
