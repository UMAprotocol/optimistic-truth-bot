        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Subscriber\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The key here is to check if she has used the term \"Subscriber\" in past briefings, as that might indicate a pattern.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several instances where \"subscriber\" is mentioned. For example, in source [2], she mentions a newsletter with nearly 1 million subscribers. In [9], she talks about podcasters and social media influencers applying for credentials, which might relate to subscribers. Source [14] discusses Politico subscriptions being canceled, and she uses the word \"subscriber\" there. Also, in [11], she refers to a newsletter with subscribers. \n\nWait, the user's query specifies that any usage of \"subscriber\" counts, regardless of context. So even if she mentions it in passing, like talking about newsletter subscribers, that would still count. From the sources provided, there are multiple instances where she has used the term in previous briefings. \n\nHowever, the next briefing hasn't happened yet. But based on her past behavior, she has a tendency to mention subscriber numbers, especially when discussing media outlets or newsletters. For example, in [2], she specifically mentions \"1 million newsletter subscribers.\" In [14], she talks about canceling subscriptions, which includes the term \"subscriber.\" \n\nGiven that she's used \"subscriber\" in previous briefings, there's a likelihood she might do so again. The resolution conditions state that pluralization or possessive forms count, so \"subscribers\" would still trigger a \"Yes.\" Since there's evidence of her using the term before, and assuming the next briefing follows similar topics (media, newsletters, subscriptions), it's probable she'll say it again.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several critical issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The primary function of the AI in this scenario is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. The response incorrectly attempts to predict whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Subscriber\" in a future event based on past occurrences. This is contrary to the instructions which clearly state that the AI should report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response uses past instances of the word \"Subscriber\" being mentioned by Karoline Leavitt to predict future behavior. This approach is speculative and not grounded in the concrete evidence required by the prompt. The AI should focus on verifying events that have already occurred.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The event in question (the next White House press briefing involving Karoline Leavitt) has not yet occurred as of the current timestamp. Therefore, the AI should have recognized this and returned a recommendation of p4, indicating that the request cannot be resolved at this time.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response exhibits a predictive bias that is not supported by the system prompt's requirements for factual verification of past events. It also fails to recognize that the event is scheduled for a future date, which should automatically trigger a response of p4.\n\nGiven these issues, the response from Perplexity AI does not meet the requirements set by the system prompt and is not satisfactory. The recommendation of p2 is incorrect because it is based on speculation rather than verification of a past event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly predicts future events instead of reporting on past, verifiable events as required.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Subscriber\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The key here is to check if she has used that term in past briefings and if there's any indication she might use it in the next one.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided search results for any instances where Leavitt mentioned \"Subscriber.\" The search results include several transcripts and articles about her press briefings. Let me go through each one.\n\nLooking at source [1], it's a YouTube video from March 19, 2025. The description mentions Forbes Breaking News and a press briefing, but the transcript snippet doesn't include the word \"Subscriber.\" The video might have more details, but the text provided doesn't show it.\n\nSource [6] is a White House press briefing transcript from January 29, 2025. She talks about new media credentials and mentions a website, but no \"Subscriber\" there. Source [11] is another briefing from February 25, 2025. Again, discussing press access but no mention of the term.\n\nSource [12] is an article where Leavitt discusses economic policies. The Dow Jones drop is mentioned, and she talks about investors and workers, but \"Subscriber\" isn't used here. Source [13] is about applying for a press pass. The article mentions \"Subscriber\" in the URL and the author's note, but Leavitt herself doesn't say it in the quoted parts.\n\nSource [14] from the National Post mentions her first briefing where she discusses tariffs and new media access. The article notes that online access is included for subscribers, but that's the publication's note, not her statement. Similarly, source [15] from the LA Times doesn't have her using the term.\n\nSource [18] discusses her wanting to change the briefing room dynamics, but again, no \"Subscriber\" in her statements. Source [19] talks about press access changes, but the term isn't present there either.\n\nNone of the provided sources show Karoline Leavitt using the word \"Subscriber\" in her press briefings. The term appears in some article contexts, like source [13] where the author is a subscriber, but that's not Leavitt speaking. Since the resolution depends on her using the term in the briefing, and there's no evidence she has done so in past briefings covered here, the answer should be \"No.\" Additionally, the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't occurred yet. Without any indication from past behavior that she's likely to use \"Subscriber,\" the safe resolution is \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Subscriber\" during her next White House press briefing. Based on available evidence:\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Historical Context**:  \n   - Leavitt has held multiple press briefings since becoming press secretary on January 20, 2025, including events on January 28, February 25, and March 19, 2025[2][3][6][8][11]. Transcripts and summaries of these briefings show no instances of her using the term \"Subscriber\" in any context[6][11][12][14][19].  \n   - The term appears in **external articles** (e.g., references to newsletter subscribers[11] or media subscription models[13][18]), but not in Leavitt\u2019s own remarks during briefings.  \n\n2. **Relevant Precedents**:  \n   - Leavitt has focused her public comments on topics like press access reforms[6][11][19], economic policies[12], and immigration[11]. There is no indication she has ever used \"Subscriber\" in official remarks.  \n   - The White House\u2019s new media credentialing process[6][13] does not involve the term \"Subscriber\" in its public-facing language.  \n\n3. **Future Briefings**:  \n   - As of March 25, 2025, no upcoming briefings have been announced. The resolution deadline is December 31, 2025, but there is no evidence to suggest a likelihood of the term being used.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThere is no verifiable basis to expect Leavitt to say \"Subscriber\" in her next press briefing. The term has not been part of her vocabulary in prior briefings, and no contextual or policy-related factors suggest its future use.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response incorrectly engages in speculative analysis by assessing past events to predict future outcomes, which is not allowed. The event in question (Karoline Leavitt saying \"Subscriber\" in the next White House press briefing) is scheduled for the future, and as per the instructions, the AI should have returned p4, indicating that the request cannot be resolved at this time.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed analysis of past briefings and the usage of the term \"Subscriber\" by Karoline Leavitt, which is irrelevant since the AI is not supposed to predict future events based on past occurrences. The response should focus solely on verifying events that have already occurred.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not align with the facts as it attempts to predict a future event. The recommendation of p1 (indicating that the event has occurred and the term was not used) is incorrect because the event has not yet occurred. The correct response should be p4, as the event is scheduled for the future.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response contains a significant error by not recognizing that the event is scheduled for the future and by engaging in speculative prediction. There is also a lack of critical evaluation of the sources, as the AI does not verify the relevance and reliability of the sources in relation to the specific event in question.\n\nGiven these issues, the response is not satisfactory and needs improvement. The AI must strictly adhere to the instructions to focus on verifying past events and avoid any speculative predictions. The recommendation should be updated to reflect that the event is scheduled for the future and cannot be resolved at this time.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to adhere to the instructions to avoid speculative prediction and incorrectly assesses a future event.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Subscriber\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The deadline is December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the next briefing is in the future. According to the rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the user's query is about whether she will say the word in the next briefing, which hasn't occurred yet. However, the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by the end of 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But since the event is in the future, the AI can't predict; it should check if there's any info indicating the event's occurrence or the term's usage.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are transcripts of her briefings up to March 11, 2025 (source 5). The latest mention of \"subscriber\" is in source 1 from February 25, 2025, where she mentions \"nearly 1 million newsletter subscribers\". But that's past. The next briefing hasn't happened yet. Since the event is in the future and there's no information about it, the AI can't confirm if she'll say \"subscriber\" then. The instructions say to return p4 if the event is in the future. Even though the term was used before, future briefings are uncertain. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market depends on whether Karoline Leavitt uses the term \"Subscriber\" (or its plural/possessive forms) during her next White House press briefing before December 31, 2025. Analysis of available transcripts shows Leavitt previously referenced \"nearly 1 million newsletter subscribers\" during a February 25, 2025 briefing[1], demonstrating her use of the term in official remarks. However, this instance occurred before the market's effective timeframe and does not apply to future briefings.\n\nNo verifiable information exists about the content of her next scheduled press briefing, as it remains a future event relative to the current timestamp of March 25, 2025. The market explicitly requires resolution based on a specific future briefing that has not yet occurred. Per the resolution conditions, any future-oriented analysis would constitute speculative prediction, which is prohibited under the guidelines.\n\n**recommendation: p4**",

The response correctly identifies that it cannot engage in speculative prediction about future events and therefore recommends p4, which aligns with the guidelines that dictate returning p4 for future events.\n\nThe response is factually accurate in its description of the event and the conditions under which the market will resolve. It correctly notes that any usage of the term \"Subscriber\" in the next briefing, regardless of context, will count toward the resolution of the market. It also correctly states that the event has not yet occurred as of the current timestamp, and thus, no concrete evidence or established facts can be used to resolve the query.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI checks for the occurrence of the event and finds that it is scheduled for the future. It also reviews past instances where the term was used but correctly concludes that these do not influence the resolution of the future event. The response adheres strictly to the guidelines by not engaging in speculative prediction and by recommending p4 due to the future scheduling of the event.\n\nHowever, there is a critical rule in the evaluation instructions that states if this is the first attempt AND the recommendation is p4, a RETRY must always be chosen. This is to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining information are exhausted before settling on a p4 recommendation. Since this is attempt #3 and not the first attempt, and the response has adhered to all other guidelines and instructions, this rule does not apply directly here. However, it emphasizes the importance of being thorough and exhaustive in our search strategies before concluding with p4.\n\nGiven the adherence to the guidelines, the factual accuracy, and the logical reasoning displayed in the response, and considering that this is not the first attempt, the response appears to be satisfactory. There is no additional information or improvement that could be realistically expected given the constraints of the event being in the future.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing the event is in the future and correctly recommends p4.
