The resolution depends on which team won. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to look through the search results to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [1][2][4][7][8] report that the St. Louis Blues won the game 7-2. For example, source [1] states the Blues cruised past the Ducks with a 7-2 victory. Source [4] from CBS Sports confirms the same score, and the YouTube highlights [7] also mention the Blues' decisive win. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the Blues win, the market resolves to \"Blues\" (p1). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, and all sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe St. Louis Blues defeated the Anaheim Ducks 7-2 in their NHL game on March 16, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the Blues dominated the matchup, scoring twice in the first 90 seconds and capitalizing on power plays and shorthanded opportunities[1][2][4][7]. Key contributors included Jordan Kyrou (3 assists), Dylan Holloway (1 goal, 1 assist), and Jordan Binnington (23 saves)[1][4]. The Blues' victory improved their record to 33-28-7, while the Ducks fell to 29-31-7[1][2]. \n\nGiven the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **\"Blues\"** as the decisive outcome aligns with the ancillary data's p1 designation. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Anaheim Ducks vs. St. Louis Blues game) occurred on March 16, 2025, and the current date is March 25, 2025, which means the event is in the past. The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event using multiple sources, which all confirm that the St. Louis Blues won the game. This aligns with the system's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows the instructions by first verifying the date of the event and then confirming its outcome through reliable sources. It correctly applies the ancillary data provided in the user prompt (p1 corresponds to a Blues win) to resolve the market.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation that the market resolves to \"Blues\" (p1) is based on concrete evidence from multiple sources confirming the Blues' victory. This is in strict adherence to the system's requirement to verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has not used any irrelevant or unverified information in making its recommendation.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is both accurate and complete, adhering strictly to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data and the verified outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the event, adhering to the system prompt instructions and using reliable sources.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and correctly applied the ancillary data to resolve the market.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742919863 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:24:23 UTC",
