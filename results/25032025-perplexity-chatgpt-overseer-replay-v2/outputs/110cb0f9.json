The event in question is scheduled for March 31, which is six days in the future. According to the personalization rules, if the event is in the future, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the user provided ancillary data that defines p1 as No, p2 as Yes, and p3 as 50-50. However, the key point here is the date. Since March 31 is a future date relative to the current timestamp, regardless of the conditions, the recommendation must be p4. \n\nLooking at the search results, the latest data points mention the index at 20 on March 4, 2025, indicating Extreme Fear. But that's historical data. The query is about a future date. Even if the current trend suggests fear, the future state isn't verifiable yet. The resolution source is CNN's site, but as of now, there's no information about March 31. \n\nThe personalization instructions are clear: future events require p4. Even if the user's ancillary data defines other outcomes, the timestamp rule takes precedence. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response logically follows this rule and recommends p4.\n\nThe response is factually accurate in recognizing the date of the event and the current date, and it correctly applies the rule that future events should be resolved with p4. The response also correctly identifies the source of the resolution (CNN's Fear & Greed Index) and notes that no current data is available for the future date in question.\n\nHowever, there is a critical rule in the evaluation guidelines stating that if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a RETRY must always be chosen. This rule is designed to ensure that every possible avenue to improve the response or gather more information is explored before settling on a p4 recommendation.\n\nTherefore, despite the response being logically sound and adhering to the instructions provided, the rule mandates a RETRY on the first attempt when p4 is recommended.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt p4 recommendations must always get a RETRY verdict to ensure all possibilities for resolution are explored.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response accurately follows the system prompt instructions for handling future events and correctly applies the p4 recommendation based on the event being scheduled in the future.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the Fear & Greed Index will show \"Extreme Fear\" on March 31, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on CNN's index, and the current date is March 25, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if March 31 is in the future relative to the current date. Since today is March 25, 2025, March 31 is six days ahead. According to the guidelines, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4. But the user mentioned a previous response that needed a retry, so I need to dig deeper.\n\nLooking at the search results, the latest data point is from March 19, 2025 (source [8]), which mentions the index is in \"Extreme Fear\" at a reading of 20. Another source from March 4, 2025 (source [1]) also confirms the index was at 20, indicating \"Extreme Fear\". However, there's no information about the index's status beyond March 19. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if CNN stops updating, the last available update before the resolution time is used. But since the event is in the future, and there's no data available for March 31 yet, we can't confirm the index's status on that specific date. Even though the index has been in \"Extreme Fear\" recently, future market conditions could change. Without real-time data or confirmed updates post-March 19, we can't definitively say the index will remain in \"Extreme Fear\" on March 31.\n\nTherefore, despite the recent trend, the future date falls outside the available data, necessitating a p4 recommendation as per the guidelines for unresolved future events.\n</think>\n\nThe Fear & Greed Index's \"Extreme Fear\" designation requires a score of 0-25 on CNN's scale[1][10][15]. While recent data shows the index at 20 (\"Extreme Fear\") as of March 4, 2025[1], and commentary from March 19, 2025, discusses ongoing extreme fear conditions[8], the resolution date of March 31, 2025, remains in the future relative to the current timestamp of March 25, 2025. \n\nNo verifiable data exists yet for March 31, 2025, and market sentiment indicators like this index can change rapidly based on new economic data, geopolitical developments, or market movements. The index's components - including stock momentum, volatility, and bond spreads[5][6] - are dynamic and subject to daily fluctuations. While recent trends show persistent fear, the future status remains uncertain as the resolution date hasn't occurred.\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response correctly identifies that it cannot definitively resolve the query due to the future nature of the event and recommends p4, which aligns with the guidelines for unresolved future events.\n\nFactual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:\n- The response correctly notes that the Fear & Greed Index's status on a future date cannot be determined with the data available up to March 19, 2025.\n- It adheres to the instruction to use the specified URL (CNN's Fear & Greed Index) as the primary source for resolution.\n- The response correctly applies the rule that if the event is in the future, a p4 recommendation is appropriate.\n\nLogical Reasoning and Completeness:\n- The response logically argues that because the event date is in the future and no data is available beyond March 19, 2025, it cannot provide a resolution based on the index's status on March 31, 2025.\n- It considers the recent trend of the index being in \"Extreme Fear\" but correctly concludes that future conditions could change, thus impacting the index.\n\nVerification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n- The response verifies that the event (Fear & Greed Index reading on March 31, 2025) has not yet occurred and aligns its recommendation (p4) with this fact.\n- It correctly uses the most recent available data to inform its analysis but acknowledges the limitation of this data due to the future date of the event.\n\nMissing Information, Bias, or Errors:\n- The response does not exhibit bias or errors in its analysis. It strictly adheres to the information available from the specified source and the guidelines provided in the system prompt.\n- There is no missing information relevant to the resolution of the query based on the guidelines and the nature of the event being in the future.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response has adhered to the instructions, accurately analyzed the available information, and logically concluded with a p4 recommendation due to the future nature of the event, the response is satisfactory. The response has improved by providing a more detailed analysis and justification for the p4 recommendation compared to the previous attempt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately follows the system prompt instructions for handling future events, correctly applies the p4 recommendation, and provides a detailed and justified analysis.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the available data and adheres to the guidelines for future events.

This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933154 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:05:54 UTC"
