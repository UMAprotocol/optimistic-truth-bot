The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Morgan State vs. Howard CBB game that was scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Morgan State wins, the market resolves to \"Morgan State\" (p2), if Howard wins, it's \"Howard\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the game should have already taken place. Now, I need to look through the search results to find out the outcome of the game.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources report the game's result. Source [2] from Morgan State's official website states that Morgan State won 91-90 against Howard in the MEAC quarterfinals. Source [11] (Fox Sports) and [13] (WTOP) both confirm the final score as 91-90 in favor of Morgan State. Additionally, source [14] from CBS Sports also reports Morgan State's victory with the same score. \n\nThese sources are reliable, especially the official team website and established sports news outlets. The detailed accounts mention Kameron Hobbs scoring 33 points, including the game-winning layup with seconds left, which solidifies the result. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution isn't p3. Since Morgan State won, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p2. All the evidence points to a Morgan State victory, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Morgan State Bears defeated the Howard Bison 91-90 in their March 13, 2025 MEAC Tournament quarterfinal game at Norfolk Scope Arena. Kameron Hobbs scored a game-high 33 points for Morgan State, including the game-winning layup with 9.2 seconds remaining[2][11][13][14]. This outcome occurred despite Howard mounting a 19-3 comeback attempt in the final minutes, briefly taking a 90-89 lead before Hobbs' decisive basket[2][13]. The game was played to completion on its scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905208 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:20:08 UTC"
