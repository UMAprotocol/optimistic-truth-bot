The ancillary data specifies that if the Magic win, it's p2 (\"Magic\"), if the Wizards win, p1 (\"Wizards\"), and other conditions for postponement or cancellation. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 21, so the event is in the past. Now, I need to verify the game's outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [4], [5], [7]) report that the Orlando Magic defeated the Washington Wizards with a score of 120-105 on March 21. For example, source [1] states, \"Paolo Banchero scored 30 points and the Orlando Magic eased to a 120-105 victory over the Washington Wizards on Friday night.\" Similarly, source [7] from ESPN confirms the same score and outcome. \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game took place as scheduled. There's no mention of any postponement or cancellation in any of the search results. Therefore, the resolution conditions for p1 or p3 don't apply here. \n\nSince the Magic won decisively, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Magic\"). All the sources corroborate this result, so there's no ambiguity. The final recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Orlando Magic defeated the Washington Wizards 120-105 in their March 21, 2025 matchup[1][4][5][7]. Paolo Banchero led the Magic with 30 points, supported by Franz Wagner's 21 points and Wendell Carter Jr.'s 16-point, 12-rebound double-double[1][4][7]. The Magic dominated throughout, using a decisive 13-0 third-quarter run to extend their lead to 88-62[1][4][7]. This victory completed Orlando's three-game season sweep of Washington by a combined 62-point margin[1][4].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively verifies the outcome of the NBA game between the Orlando Magic and the Washington Wizards, which took place on March 21, 2025, and confirms that the Orlando Magic won the game. The response uses multiple sources to verify the game's outcome, ensuring that the information is reliable and not based on a single source. This thorough verification aligns with the requirement to use concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it correctly identifies the event's date and checks that it is in the past relative to the current timestamp. It then proceeds to verify the outcome through reliable sources and aligns the resolution recommendation (p2 for a Magic win) with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The response also correctly ignores any conditions that do not apply, such as postponement or cancellation, since the game occurred as scheduled.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the event in question and its specific outcome without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event using multiple reliable sources and aligns the resolution recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, using verified facts to determine the outcome of the event and making a recommendation based on these facts.

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742916991 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 15:36:31 UTC",
