        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know whether AZ Alkmaar or Tottenham Hotspur advanced in the UEFA Europa League based on the provided search results and ancillary data. \n\nFirst, I need to check the ancillary data to understand the resolution conditions. The market resolves to \"Tottenham\" (p2) if they advance, \"AZ Alkmaar\" (p1) if they do, and p3 if the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025. The current date is March 25, 2025, so any postponement would have to be after that, but the match already happened in March 2025 according to the search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8]) report that Tottenham Hotspur won the second leg 3-1 against AZ Alkmaar on March 13, 2025, overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit. The aggregate score was 3-2 in favor of Tottenham, which means they advanced to the quarter-finals. \n\nThe key points from the sources are:\n- The second leg was played on March 13, 2025, with Tottenham winning 3-1 at home.\n- The aggregate score after both legs was 3-2 to Tottenham.\n- Wilson Odobert scored twice, and James Maddison added another goal for Spurs.\n- Official match reports from Tottenham's website and ESPN confirm the result and advancement.\n\nSince the event date (March 13, 2025) is in the past and the outcome is clearly documented across multiple reliable sources, there's no ambiguity. The match wasn't postponed or canceled, so the resolution can't be p3. The ancillary data specifies that p2 corresponds to Tottenham advancing, which aligns with the search results. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nTottenham Hotspur advanced to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals after defeating AZ Alkmaar 3-1 in the second leg of their Round of 16 matchup on March 13, 2025, overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit. The aggregate score of 3-2 secured their progression[1][3][4][6][7][8]. \n\n**Key details of the decisive match:**\n- Wilson Odobert scored twice (26', 74'), marking his first goals for Spurs, while James Maddison added a third (48')[1][4][6].\n- AZ Alkmaar\u2019s Peer Koopmeiners temporarily leveled the aggregate score at 2-2 with a 63rd-minute goal[1][4].\n- The match concluded without postponement or cancellation, and the result was confirmed by UEFA\u2019s official channels[1][4][7].\n\n**Resolution conditions met:**  \n- The ancillary data specifies that advancement by Tottenham Hotspur corresponds to resolution **p2**.  \n- No evidence of match cancellation or postponement beyond December 31, 2025, exists[1][4][7].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926230 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:10:30 UTC"
