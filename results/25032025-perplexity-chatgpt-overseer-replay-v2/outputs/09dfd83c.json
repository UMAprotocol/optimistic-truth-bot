The ancillary data specifies that if George Mason wins, it's p1; George Washington, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14, so the game should have happened. Let me look through the search results to confirm the outcome. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles ([1], [4], [9], [11], [12], [13]) report that George Mason won the game 80-65. For example, source [1] is a detailed recap from George Mason's athletics site, stating they dominated the second half. Source [4] from George Washington's site confirms their loss. The AP news articles ([11], [12], [13]) also confirm the score and that George Mason advanced. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 since George Mason won. The ancillary data maps p1 to George Mason, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe George Mason Patriots defeated the George Washington Revolutionaries 80-65 in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament quarterfinals on March 14, 2025. This outcome was confirmed by multiple sources, including official team reports and Associated Press coverage[1][4][9][11][13]. George Mason's victory was powered by Jalen Haynes' game-high 24 points and a dominant second-half defensive performance that limited George Washington to 23.1% shooting[1][11]. The game was played as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
