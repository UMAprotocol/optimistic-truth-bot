        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Liberty vs. Oregon game. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the given resolution conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 21, 2025, so it's in the past. That means I need to verify if the event occurred and what the result was.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Source [1] from the Oregon Ducks' official site mentions a dominant performance leading to a second-round advancement. The score is detailed, with Oregon winning 81-52. Source [2], a recap from The Score, also states Oregon routed Liberty 81-52. Similarly, sources [4], [5], and [6] all report the same score and outcome. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Oregon wins, the market resolves to p1. Since all sources confirm Oregon's victory, the resolution should be p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between the Oregon Ducks and Liberty Flames occurred as scheduled on March 21, 2025, at 10:10 PM ET. Fifth-seeded Oregon defeated 12th-seeded Liberty decisively with a final score of **81-52**[1][2][4][5]. The Ducks established early dominance with an 18-2 opening run and maintained a 24-point halftime lead (44-20)[1][2]. Key performances included Jackson Shelstad\u2019s 17 points (15 in the first half) and Nate Bittle\u2019s double-double (14 points, 10 rebounds)[2][4]. Liberty struggled offensively, shooting 22% from three-point range[2][4], while Oregon\u2019s defense held them to a season-low 52 points[1]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, and no make-up contingency was triggered.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It uses multiple reliable sources to verify the outcome of the game, which is that Oregon won against Liberty with a score of 81-52. This outcome aligns with the user's resolution condition that if Oregon wins, the market should resolve to \"p1\".\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with the verification of the event date, followed by a search for reliable sources confirming the outcome, and concluding with a resolution recommendation. The response includes detailed information about the game's progress and key performances, which supports the credibility of the outcome reported.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"p1\" is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the user's specified resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question, uses verified sources, and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions provided by the user.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
