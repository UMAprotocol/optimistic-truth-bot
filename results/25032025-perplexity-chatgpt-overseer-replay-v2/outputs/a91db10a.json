The ancillary data specifies that if UConn wins, it's p1; Oklahoma, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 21) is in the past. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] from UConn's official site says they won 67-59. That's a primary source, so that's solid. [2] ESPN's recap confirms the same score and outcome. [3] Another ESPN article mentions the 13th straight win, tying Duke's record. [4] Oklahoma's own site also reports the loss, with Fears scoring 20 points. [5] Sporting News and [6] Bleacher Report both detail UConn's victory. [7] CBS Sports had pre-game odds but also a post-game update in [8] confirming UConn's win.\n\nAll sources agree UConn won 67-59. No mentions of postponement or cancellation. The game happened as scheduled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (UConn). No conflicting info found. All sources are reliable and consistent. Recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament game between UConn and Oklahoma occurred on March 21, 2025, as scheduled. UConn defeated Oklahoma with a final score of **67-59**[1][2][4][6]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided, where a UConn victory corresponds to **p1**. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the result was verified across multiple authoritative sources, including official team websites[1][4], ESPN[2][3], and sports media outlets[6][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the NCAA Tournament game between UConn and Oklahoma occurred on March 21, 2025, and that UConn won with a score of 67-59. This outcome is verified through multiple reliable sources including UConn's official site, ESPN, and other sports media outlets. The response adheres strictly to the instructions by confirming the event's occurrence and outcome based on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt, where a UConn win corresponds to p1. The reasoning is thorough and well-structured, leading to a clear and justified recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using primary sources such as the official team websites and reputable sports news outlets. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided, where p1 corresponds to a UConn win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no missing information, bias, or errors detected in the response. The response is neutral, based on concrete evidence, and free from any speculative or biased statements.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923555 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:25:55 UTC",
