        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Elon\" during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the resolution deadline is December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there have been any press briefings after March 25 where Leavitt participated. The search results provided go up to March 19, 2025. The latest briefing mentioned is on March 19 (source 8 and 14). There's no information about briefings after March 25. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the user is asking about the \"next\" briefing, which would be after this date. However, the provided search results don't include any data beyond March 19. \n\nNext, I need to consider if Leavitt is still the White House Press Secretary. The search results don't indicate any change in her position as of March 19. The query states that if she ceases to be press secretary before December 31, the market resolves to \"No\". But there's no evidence of that happening yet.\n\nLooking at past behavior, Leavitt has frequently mentioned Elon Musk in briefings. For example, in the February 25 briefing (source 1), she discussed Musk's role in DOGE. On February 20 (source 12), she mentioned Musk's involvement in the administration. However, these are all before the current date of March 25. \n\nSince the next briefing after March 25 isn't covered in the provided sources, and without access to future data, I can't confirm if she says \"Elon\" in a future briefing. The market requires resolution based on actual events, not predictions. If no briefing occurs by December 31, it resolves to \"No\". But since we don't have information post-March 25, and the user is asking now, we have to assume that as of the current date, the next briefing hasn't happened yet. \n\nTherefore, without evidence of the term being used in the next briefing (which hasn't occurred yet according to the data), the resolution should default to \"No\" unless future briefings prove otherwise. However, the user's current timestamp is March 25, and the latest briefing in the data is March 19. The next briefing after March 25 would be in the future relative to the current date provided. Since the event is scheduled for a future date and hasn't occurred yet, per the ancillary data, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1) because the event hasn't happened by the current date. Wait, but the resolution deadline is December 31. The user is asking now, but the market is still active until the end of 2025. However, the query specifies that if no briefing happens by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking for the current resolution status as of March 25. Since the next briefing is in the future relative to March 25, and we don't have data on it, the correct resolution is p4, which is for future events. Wait, the ancillary data says if the event is scheduled for a future date, resolve to p4. But in this case, the next briefing is a future event as of March 25. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the query's ancillary data says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". The current timestamp is March 25, 2025. The next briefing after that hasn't occurred yet, so it's a future event. Therefore, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's query might be asking whether, based on past behavior, it's likely she will say \"Elon\" in the next briefing. But according to the rules, if the event is in the future, regardless of likelihood, we must return p4. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question (Karoline Leavitt saying \"Elon\" during the next White House press briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp of March 25, 2025. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that it cannot resolve the query based on past or speculative data and must consider the event as a future occurrence. The logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it navigates through the available data, acknowledges the absence of relevant future data, and concludes that the event is yet to occur.\n\nHowever, the response exhibits a significant issue in its final recommendation. According to the critical rule provided, if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a RETRY verdict must be issued. This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining relevant information are exhausted before defaulting to p4, which indicates that the event cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nThe response could potentially improve by employing updated search strategies or accessing more current data sources that might provide information about any scheduled briefings after March 25, 2025. This could include checking more recent news updates, official White House schedules, or press releases that might not have been captured in the initial search.\n\nGiven these considerations, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt with a p4 recommendation requires a retry to exhaust all possible information sources.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response logically deduces the need for a p4 based on the absence of data for future events but needs to retry with potentially updated search strategies or sources.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please check for any new updates or sources that might provide information on White House press briefings scheduled after March 25, 2025.\"\n}\n```",

        "attempt": 2,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Elon\" during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The resolution conditions are clear: if she says \"Elon\" in any context, including plural or possessive forms, it's a \"Yes\" (p2). If not, or if no briefing happens by the end of 2025, it's \"No\" (p1). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The next press briefing after this date would be the one to consider. Looking at the search results, there's a mention of a briefing on March 19, 2025 (source 15 and 18). However, the transcripts or details from that briefing aren't provided in the search results. The latest briefing detailed is from March 5 (source 11) and March 19 (source 15, 18), but the content isn't fully available here. \n\nThe search results do show that Leavitt has frequently discussed Elon Musk's role in DOGE, referring to him as a \"special government employee\" and mentioning his oversight (sources 1, 4, 7, 8, 19). However, in the provided transcripts, she uses \"Musk\" rather than \"Elon\". For example, in source 7, when asked about Musk, she refers to him as \"Elon Musk\" but the transcript shows her using \"Musk\" in her responses. \n\nThe key point is whether she uses the first name \"Elon\" alone. The ancillary data specifies that any usage of the term \"Elon\" counts, but in the available transcripts, she uses his full name or \"Musk\". There's no instance where she says just \"Elon\". \n\nAdditionally, the next briefing after March 25 hasn't occurred yet, and the search results don't provide information beyond March 19. Since the current date is March 25, any future briefings would be after this date. Without evidence from those, we can't confirm if she says \"Elon\". \n\nMoreover, the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025. However, since Leavitt is still the press secretary as of the current date, and briefings are ongoing, the resolution depends on the specific next briefing. But without access to future events or transcripts, we can't verify if \"Elon\" is used. \n\nTherefore, based on the available data up to March 25, 2025, there's no confirmation that she has used \"Elon\" in the next briefing (which would be after the current date). Hence, the recommendation is p4, as the event is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, and we lack conclusive evidence.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt will say \"Elon\" during her next press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she uses the term in any form (including plural/possessive) during the next briefing she participates in before December 31, 2025.  \n\n### Key Analysis:  \n1. **Current Context**:  \n   - Leavitt has consistently referred to Elon Musk by his full name or as \"Musk\" in prior briefings (e.g., \"Elon Musk is overseeing DOGE\" [1][4][8][19]).  \n   - She has never been recorded using only \"Elon\" in official briefings, despite frequent discussions about Musk\u2019s role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) [1][4][7][19].  \n\n2. **Future Briefing Uncertainty**:  \n   - The next briefing after March 25, 2025, has not yet occurred, and no transcripts or video from future events are available in the provided sources.  \n   - Leavitt remains press secretary as of March 25, 2025, with no indication of imminent departure [6][11][15][18].  \n\n3. **Resolution Conditions**:  \n   - The market resolves to \"No\" (p1) if the term isn\u2019t used or if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025.  \n   - Without verifiable evidence of the term\u2019s usage in a future briefing, the outcome cannot be definitively determined at this time.  \n\n### Recommendation: p4  \n**Rationale**: The event (next press briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). No verifiable information exists about the specific term\u2019s usage in upcoming briefings, and the resolution depends on an event that has not yet occurred.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

It correctly adheres to the instruction that if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically deduces that since the next briefing after March 25, 2025, has not yet occurred, and no transcripts or video from future events are available, it cannot confirm whether the term \"Elon\" will be used. This reasoning is sound and aligns with the system prompt requirements to base the resolution on verifiable facts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the next briefing is a future event and aligns the recommendation (p4) with this fact, as no information about the event's occurrence or content is available at the time of the response.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not speculate or infer outcomes without evidence, which is crucial for maintaining objectivity and accuracy.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response adheres to the guidelines, provides a logically sound analysis, and correctly applies the p4 recommendation due to the future scheduling of the event, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the system prompt instructions by correctly identifying the event as scheduled for a future date and recommending p4 based on the lack of available information.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and correctly applies the guidelines for handling events scheduled in the future.

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928755 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:52:35 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease check for any new updates or sources that might provide information on White House press briefings scheduled after March 25, 2025.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response logically deduces the need for a p4 based on the absence of data for future events but needs to retry with potentially updated search strategies or sources.\n\n1. Dig deeper into available sources and data\n2. Be more critical of potentially unreliable sources\n3. Consider all interpretations of the query\n4.
