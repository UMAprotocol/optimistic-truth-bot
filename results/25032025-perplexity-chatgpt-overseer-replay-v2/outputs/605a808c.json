        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the U.S. will deport illegal migrants to El Salvador before April, specifically by March 31, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The resolution conditions state that the answer is \"Yes\" if any illegal alien not from El Salvador is transferred there for incarceration or deportation by that deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The deadline is in six days. Now, looking at the search results provided, there are several key points. \n\nSearch result [2] from March 16, 2025, mentions that the Trump administration has already sent hundreds of Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador. This happened despite a federal judge's order. The article also notes that over 250 members of Tren de Aragua were sent to El Salvador. \n\nResult [8] from March 17, 2025, states that a federal judge blocked some deportations, but the administration managed to deport 238 Tren de Aragua members and 23 MS-13 members to El Salvador. The judge's order came after some deportations had already occurred. \n\nResult [10] from March 20, 2025, provides specific details about Venezuelan migrants, including Franco Jos\u00e9 Caraballo Tiapa, who was deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison. Even though he had no criminal record, he was on the deportation list. \n\nResult [7] from March 23, 2025, confirms that over 200 Venezuelans were deported to El Salvador, and the White House proceeded despite a judge's temporary restraining order. \n\nAdditionally, result [11] from March 17, 2025, mentions the U.S. paid El Salvador $6 million to take in these individuals, and the deportations occurred over the weekend of March 16-17. \n\nAll these sources indicate that deportations have already taken place before the March 31 deadline. The key points are the actual transfers of individuals, their entry into El Salvador's territory, and the timing before the cutoff date. Even though some legal challenges were attempted, the transfers occurred and meet the criteria specified in the ancillary data. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe U.S. has already transferred non-Salvadoran illegal migrants to El Salvador for incarceration before the March 31, 2025, deadline, fulfilling the resolution criteria for a \"Yes\" outcome. Key developments include:\n\n## Confirmed Deportations to El Salvador\n- **March 16-17, 2025**: The Trump administration deported **238 Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members** and **23 Salvadoran MS-13 members** to El Salvador\u2019s CECOT prison[2][8][11]. These transfers occurred despite a federal judge\u2019s attempt to block the flights, as the administration argued the order came too late to halt the first wave[7][8].\n- **Non-gang deportees**: At least one Venezuelan migrant, Franco Jos\u00e9 Caraballo Tiapa, was deported despite having no criminal record in the U.S. or Venezuela[10]. Internal DHS documents acknowledge some deportees lacked criminal histories but were flagged as alleged gang members[10].\n\n## Legal and Operational Details\n- The U.S. invoked the **Alien Enemies Act of 1798** to justify rapid deportations, paying El Salvador $6 million to house detainees[2][11].\n- Transfers involved physical entry into El Salvador\u2019s territory, with video evidence showing prisoners being marched into CECOT[2][8].\n\n## Judicial Challenges\n- A March 16 temporary restraining order by Judge James Boasberg failed to stop the initial deportations, though it paused subsequent flights[7][8].\n- The administration maintains its actions complied with the law, while civil rights groups contest the legality of labeling migrants as \u201cenemies\u201d[8][10].\n\nSince the resolution conditions specify that **any qualifying transfer before March 31** triggers a \u201cYes\u201d outcome\u2014even if later halted\u2014the documented March 16-17 deportations meet this threshold.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934291 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:24:51 UTC",
