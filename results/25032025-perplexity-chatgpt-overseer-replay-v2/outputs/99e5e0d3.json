The ancillary data specifies that if the Spurs win, it's p2 (Spurs), if the Raptors win, p1 (Raptors), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query mentions March 23 at 6:00 PM ET. The current date provided is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. \n\nNext, I check the search results to see the outcome. Multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [9], [11], [14]) report that the Spurs won the game 123-89. For example, source [1] states the Spurs defeated the Raptors, and source [11] from ESPN's recap confirms the final score. The Raptors' record drops to 24-47, while the Spurs improve to 31-39, which aligns with a Spurs victory.\n\nI also need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The search results don't indicate any postponement; instead, they discuss the game's details and aftermath. Source [10] talks about rescheduled games, but none related to this specific matchup. \n\nSince the game occurred as scheduled and the Spurs won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no conflicting information in the sources, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs defeated the Toronto Raptors 123-89 on March 23, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][3][9][11][14]. The game was played as scheduled at 6:00 PM ET at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports.  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- Final score: Spurs 123, Raptors 89[1][11]  \n- Spurs improved to 31-39, Raptors fell to 24-47[3][9]  \n- Devin Vassell led San Antonio with 25 points[1][9][11]  \n- The outcome was decisive, with San Antonio leading by as many as 38 points[3][11]  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, this market resolves to **p2 (Spurs)** as San Antonio won the game outright.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence, the outcome, and aligns the recommendation with the facts provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:\n   - The response correctly identifies that the Spurs vs. Raptors game occurred on March 23, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, confirming the event is in the past.\n   - It accurately reports the outcome of the game with the Spurs winning against the Raptors with a score of 123-89, which matches the resolution condition for a Spurs win (p2).\n   - The response checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and correctly finds none, adhering to the prompt's requirement to verify such conditions.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness:\n   - The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which strengthens the reliability of the resolution.\n   - It logically connects the outcome of the game to the specified resolution condition (p2 for a Spurs win).\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and time, and at the specified location (Scotiabank Arena in Toronto).\n   - The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:\n   - There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response thoroughly checks for and rules out any game postponements or cancellations.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742921277 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:47:57 UTC"
