        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Kent State vs. Miami (OH) game on March 14, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Miami (OH) wins, the market resolves to p1, Kent State to p2, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 14, 2025. Multiple sources like CBS Sports, ESPN, and the Kent State athletics site confirm the game happened. So no postponement or cancellation here.\n\nNext, determining the winner. The search results consistently state that Miami (OH) won 72-64. For example, source [1] from CBS Sports details the score and key players. Other sources like [3], [5], [7], [10], [11], and [12] all corroborate the 72-64 victory for Miami (OH). Even the Kent State's own website [3] acknowledges the loss. \n\nThere's no conflicting information about the outcome. All sources agree on the final score and Miami (OH) advancing to the MAC championship. Since the game was played and Miami (OH) won, the resolution should be p1. No need to consider p3 because the game wasn't canceled. \n\nI should also check the date to ensure it's not a future event. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14, so the event has definitely occurred. \n\nNo mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any source. All focus is on the game's outcome. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 as Miami (OH) won.\n</think>\n\nThe March 14, 2025, college basketball game between Kent State and Miami (OH) concluded with Miami (OH) defeating Kent State 72-64 in the Mid-American Conference Tournament semifinals[1][3][5][7][10][11][12]. The game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Miami (OH) advanced to the MAC championship game against Akron, while Kent State's season ended with this loss[1][9].  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- Final score: **Miami (OH) 72**, Kent State 64[1][5][7].  \n- Miami (OH) guard Peter Suder led all scorers with 23 points and 11 rebounds[1][10][11].  \n- Kent State\u2019s Jalen Sullinger scored a team-high 29 points but shot just 9-of-24 from the field[3][9].  \n- The RedHawks secured the win with a strong second-half performance, including 17 points from Kam Craft in the final 20 minutes[1][14].  \n\nSince the game was completed and Miami (OH) won, the market resolves to **p1** (Miami (OH)).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Kent State vs. Miami (OH) basketball game) and its date (March 14, 2025). It verifies that the event has occurred by checking the current date (March 25, 2025) and confirms the outcome (Miami (OH) won 72-64) using multiple reliable sources such as CBS Sports, ESPN, and the official Kent State athletics site. This aligns with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds through the necessary steps to resolve the query. It first confirms the event occurred as scheduled, then identifies the winner based on consistent information from multiple sources, and finally aligns the resolution (p1 for Miami (OH) win) with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The response is thorough in covering all potential outcomes (win, postponement, cancellation) and confirms the actual outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple sources, ensuring reliability. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is based on verified facts and aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the event using verified sources and aligns the resolution recommendation with the ancillary data provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and adheres to the system prompt instructions, effectively using multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and ensuring the resolution recommendation is accurate.\"\n}\n```",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907934 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:05:34 UTC"
