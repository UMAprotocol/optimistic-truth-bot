The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 13 at 11:00 AM ET at Rocket Arena. Sources [6], [7], [8], [10], and [11] all report the game occurred with Akron winning 96-67. \n\nNext, confirm the result. Multiple sources, including the official Akron athletics site [6] and ESPN [7], state Akron won by a significant margin. The score is consistent across these sources, so the outcome is clear. \n\nCheck for any postponement or cancellation. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled, so no issues there. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Akron wins, resolve to p1. Since Akron won decisively, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information found; all sources agree on the result.\n</think>\n\nThe Bowling Green vs. Akron men's basketball game occurred as scheduled on **March 13, 2025, at 11:00 AM ET** at Rocket Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. Akron defeated Bowling Green with a final score of **96-67**[6][7][10]. This result was confirmed by multiple sources, including the official Akron Zips athletics website, ESPN, and Bowling Green's own coverage[6][7][8][10][11]. \n\nKey details from the game:\n- Akron set a MAC Tournament record with **16 three-pointers**[6][10].\n- Six Akron players scored in double digits, led by Bowen Hardman (17 points)[6][10].\n- Bowling Green's Marcus Johnson scored a game-high 23 points[8][11].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required.

The date and outcome of the game are verified through multiple reliable sources, ensuring the factual accuracy of the response.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for the occurrence, result, and any potential postponements or cancellations of the game. It confirms that Akron won the game, which aligns with the resolution condition (p1 for an Akron win). The response also provides additional details about the game, which, while not necessary for the resolution, contribute to the completeness and context of the analysis.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and at the specified location. It confirms the game result across multiple sources and correctly aligns the recommendation (p1) with the outcome as per the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information or assumptions beyond what is verified by the sources.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
