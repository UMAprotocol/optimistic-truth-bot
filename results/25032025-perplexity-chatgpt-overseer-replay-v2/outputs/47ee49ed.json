The resolution depends on the specific terms being mentioned in that particular event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are [3] and [16], which both mention the event on March 24, 2025, where Trump and Governor Jeff Landry delivered remarks. However, the transcripts or detailed content of their speeches aren't available in the search results. \n\nLooking at [3], it's a news article that just states the event happened but doesn't provide a transcript. Similarly, [16] is a YouTube video description of the event, but again, there's no transcript available in the search results. The other sources mention Trump's AI-related actions and speeches on other dates, like the executive order in January 2025 and investment announcements, but those are separate events. \n\nThe user's query specifies that only the March 24 event counts. Since there's no evidence in the provided search results that Trump used the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during that specific event, I can't confirm he did. The absence of transcripts or direct quotes from that event means there's no verification. Therefore, based on the available information, the answer should resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question occurred on March 24, 2025, and has adhered to the user prompt's requirement to focus solely on this specific event for resolution. The response also correctly identifies that the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" must be explicitly mentioned during the event to resolve the market to \"Yes.\"\n\nHowever, the response indicates that transcripts or detailed content of the speeches from the event are not available in the search results provided. This lack of direct evidence from the event itself is critical, as the resolution of the market depends on the specific words used by Donald Trump during this event. The response logically concludes that, due to the absence of transcripts or direct quotes confirming the use of the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence,\" the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n\nThe response is factually accurate in its adherence to the instructions, as it does not speculate beyond the available evidence and maintains focus on the specific event mentioned in the user prompt. The logical reasoning is sound, given the absence of direct evidence from the event itself. The recommendation aligns with the facts presented and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not stray from the event specified in the user prompt and correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information available, the response is satisfactory and does not appear to require further attempts or adjustments. The decision to resolve the market to \"No\" based on the absence of evidence to the contrary is justified and aligns with the principles of cautious and evidence-based resolution in the context of UMA's optimistic oracle system.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, logically concludes based on the available evidence, and correctly applies the resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the available information to make a reasoned and cautious resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926275 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:11:15 UTC",
