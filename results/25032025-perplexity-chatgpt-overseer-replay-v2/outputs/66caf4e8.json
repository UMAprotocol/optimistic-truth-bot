The ancillary data specifies that if the Oilers win, it's p2; Rangers win is p1, and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened. Checking the search results, all sources [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] report that the Oilers won 3-1. For example, source [1] states the Oilers' victory with goals from Arvidsson and McDavid. The other sources like CBS Sports and ESPN also confirm the same score. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place on March 16 without any indication of cancellation. Therefore, the resolution conditions don't apply to postponement or cancellation. \n\nSince the Oilers won, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p2. All sources are consistent, so there's no conflicting information. The recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers defeated the New York Rangers 3-1 in their NHL game on March 16, 2025, at Madison Square Garden. Key moments included Viktor Arvidsson's tiebreaking goal in the third period and Connor McDavid's insurance goal, supported by Ryan Nugent-Hopkins' three assists and Stuart Skinner's 21 saves[1][2][4][6][8]. The Rangers' lone goal came from Will Cuylle in the second period[2][4]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p2** (Oilers win). \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Oilers vs. Rangers game occurred on March 16, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, which means the game has already taken place. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is that the Oilers won 3-1. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where an Oilers win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled and finds none, which is crucial for resolving the market correctly. It then logically concludes that since the Oilers won, the market should resolve to p2. The response also provides details of the game, such as key players and moments, which supports the credibility of the sources and the factual accuracy of the outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) directly with the facts as stipulated in the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and the system prompt's guidelines for resolution based on verified facts.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the Oilers vs. Rangers game, adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, and provides a clear and justified recommendation.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the Oilers vs. Rangers game, adheres to the resolution conditions, and provides a clear and justified recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome and checks for any possible cancellations or postponements, ensuring a thorough and accurate resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
