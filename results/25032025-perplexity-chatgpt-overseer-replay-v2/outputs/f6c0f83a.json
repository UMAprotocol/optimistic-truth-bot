The ancillary data specifies that if Elon wins, it's p2; if Army wins, p1; if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened two days ago. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources confirm the result. Source [2] from ESPN shows the final score as Army 83, Elon 78. Source [3] is an article from Army's official site titled \"Men's Basketball Earns First Postseason Win in 55 Years in Comeback Win over Elon\" with the same score. Source [6] and [9] from FloHoops also report Army's 83-78 victory. Additionally, Elon's own athletics website (source [13]) confirms their loss to Army with that score. \n\nAll these sources are reliable and consistent. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as it was played on the scheduled date. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Army won, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe March 23, 2025, college basketball game between Army and Elon concluded with **Army defeating Elon 83-78** in the Purple College Basketball Invitational (CBI) first round[2][3][6][13]. Army overcame a 21-point second-half deficit, marking its first postseason win since 1970[3][10]. Key performances included Jalen Rucker\u2019s 27 points and Jorn Everson\u2019s 22 points for Army, while Elon\u2019s Sam Sherry led with 23 points and 14 rebounds[3][13]. The game was played as scheduled, with no postponement or cancellation[2][3].  \n\n**Resolution**: Based on the outcome and the ancillary data, the market resolves to **\"Army\"**.  \nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
