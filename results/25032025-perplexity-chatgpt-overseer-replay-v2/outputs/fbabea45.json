The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the New York Rangers and Columbus Blue Jackets scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Rangers win, the market resolves to \"Rangers\" (p2), if the Blue Jackets win, it's \"Blue Jackets\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the actual outcome of the game. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 15, so the event has already occurred. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [5], [7]) report that the Rangers won the game 4-0. For example, source [1] states, \"Shesterkin gets 5th shutout of season and Rangers top Blue Jackets 4-0,\" and source [5] shows the final score as 4-0 in favor of the Rangers. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place on March 15 without any indication of cancellation. Therefore, the resolution isn't p3. Since the Rangers won decisively, the market should resolve to p2 according to the ancillary data. \n\nI also cross-referenced other sources to confirm consistency. Source [2] mentions the Rangers' victory with a shutout, and the YouTube video in [7] title confirms the 4-0 result. There's no conflicting information in the search results. All evidence points to a clear Rangers win. Thus, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Rangers defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-0 in their NHL game on March 15, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the Rangers secured a shutout victory with Igor Shesterkin making 21 saves[1][2][5][7]. The game was played as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation[1][2][5]. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Rangers 4, Blue Jackets 0[1][5]\n- Shesterkin recorded his fifth shutout of the season[1][2]\n- The Rangers scored twice in the third period to seal the win[2]\n\nGiven the Rangers' decisive victory and the game being completed as scheduled, the market resolves to **\"Rangers\"** per the defined conditions.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between the New York Rangers and Columbus Blue Jackets) occurred on March 15, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the event date. The AI checked multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is that the Rangers won 4-0. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Rangers win should resolve to \"Rangers\" (p2).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, and cross-references multiple sources to ensure consistency and reliability in the reported outcome. The AI's reasoning process is thorough and logically structured, leading to a clear and justified recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation to resolve the market as \"Rangers\" (p2) is based on verified facts that the Rangers won the game. The response aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies the resolution conditions based on the game's outcome.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI effectively used the information available and adhered strictly to the guidelines provided in the system prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.
