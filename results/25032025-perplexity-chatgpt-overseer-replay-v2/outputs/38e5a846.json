The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Houston Rockets vs. Miami Heat game scheduled for March 21, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Rockets win, it's p2; if the Heat win, p1; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened four days ago. That means I need to verify the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, the first source [1] from ESPN clearly states that the Rockets won 102-98. Fred VanVleet scored 37 points, and the Rockets extended their winning streak to nine. The Heat's losing streak continued to ten. Source [4] and [5] are YouTube videos highlighting VanVleet's performance, confirming the Rockets' victory. Source [8], another YouTube video of the highlights, ends with the score 102-98 in favor of the Rockets. \n\nOther sources like [2] list the event date as March 21, and [7] mentions the game's prediction, which aligns with the actual outcome. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game being played as scheduled with the Rockets winning. \n\nSince the event occurred, and the Rockets won, the resolution should be p2. No conflicting information or future dates here. Everything checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe Houston Rockets defeated the Miami Heat 102-98 on March 21, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][4][5][8]. Fred VanVleet led the Rockets with 37 points and nine three-pointers, while Amen Thompson contributed 18 points and seven steals in his return from injury[1][5]. The game occurred as scheduled at 8:00 PM ET at Kaseya Center, with no indications of postponement or cancellation[2][7].  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- The Rockets extended their winning streak to nine games[1][3]  \n- Miami\u2019s 10th consecutive loss marked their longest skid since 2007-08[1]  \n- Houston overcame an 11-point third-quarter deficit and dominated rebounding (46-34)[1][5]  \n\nSince the game concluded with a Rockets victory, the market resolves to **p2** (Rockets).  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930186 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:16:26 UTC",
