First, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place on March 13. The sources [1], [2], [4], [5], and [7] all mention the game happening at Madison Square Garden as part of the Big East Tournament quarterfinals. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation, so the game was played.\n\nNext, determine the winner. All sources report Creighton won 85-81 in double overtime. For example, source [1] states Creighton's victory, and [4] from CBS Sports also confirms the score. Even DePaul's own athletics site [2] acknowledges the loss. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Creighton wins, the market resolves to p1. Since Creighton won, the recommendation should be p1. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for resolving to p1.\n</think>\n\nCreighton defeated DePaul 85-81 in a double-overtime thriller during the Big East Tournament quarterfinals on March 13, 2025, at Madison Square Garden. The game proceeded as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the search results. Ryan Kalkbrenner led Creighton with 32 points and nine rebounds, including critical plays in the second overtime to secure the victory[1][4][5]. DePaul's Layden Blocker scored a career-high 25 points, but the Blue Demons fell short despite holding a 15-point halftime lead[2][7].  \n\n**Key Details:**  \n- **Final Score:** Creighton 85, DePaul 81 (2OT)  \n- **Game Date:** March 13, 2025, 7:00 PM ET  \n- **Venue:** Madison Square Garden, New York  \n- **Outcome:** The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, meeting the resolution criteria outlined in the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
