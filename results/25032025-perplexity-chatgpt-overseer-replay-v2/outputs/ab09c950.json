        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Elon\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are based on whether she uses the term, with \"Yes\" being p2. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer press secretary by then.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there have been any press briefings after March 25, 2025, up until now. The search results provided go up to March 19, 2025 (result [9]) and March 17, 2025 (result [13]). The latest briefing mentioned is on March 17, 2025. There's no information about any briefings after March 25, so as of the current date, there's no next briefing yet. \n\nNext, looking at her history, Leavitt frequently mentions Elon Musk in briefings. For example, in the February 23 briefing (result [1]), she mentions Elon multiple times. Similarly, in the March 19 briefing (result [9]), she discusses Elon Musk's Teslas. Her pattern shows she often refers to Elon Musk, especially in the context of DOGE and government efficiency efforts. \n\nHowever, the query specifies the \"next\" briefing after March 25. Since there's no data on briefings after that date, we can't confirm if she has already held one. The market remains unresolved until a briefing occurs. If no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to \"No\". But given her role is ongoing (as per her Wikipedia page, result [16]), and she's active, it's likely she'll hold more briefings. \n\nBut since the current date is March 25, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet, we can't predict with certainty. However, based on past behavior, there's a high probability she'll mention \"Elon\" again. But according to the rules, if the event hasn't occurred yet (future relative to current timestamp), we must return p4. Wait, the ancillary data says if the event is scheduled for a future date, resolve p4. But here, the event is whether she says \"Elon\" in the next briefing, which hasn't occurred yet. Since the current date is March 25, and the next briefing is in the future, the resolution should be p4. But wait, the user's personalization rules say if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the query's resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to \"No\". But since the event hasn't occurred yet, and it's a future event, the correct recommendation is p4. But wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". Since the next briefing is after March 25, which is the current date, it's a future event. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that it cannot predict future outcomes and must base its resolution on events that have already occurred. The response logically concludes that since the next briefing has not yet occurred as of the current date, the resolution must be p4, indicating that the query cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nHowever, the critical rule for the UMA optimistic oracle system states that if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a retry must always be chosen. This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining information are exhausted before concluding that the query cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nThe response is factually accurate in its assessment of the situation based on the information available up to the current date. It correctly applies the rules set forth in the system prompt regarding the handling of events scheduled for future dates. The logical reasoning is sound, and the response is complete in its analysis of the available information and the application of the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nHowever, due to the system's rules, despite the accuracy and logical soundness of the response, a retry is mandated. This is to ensure that no additional information can be obtained that might allow for a resolution other than p4 on a subsequent attempt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt p4 recommendations must always get a retry verdict to exhaust all possible avenues for information.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response accurately adheres to the system prompt instructions and logically concludes that the query cannot be resolved at this time due to the event being scheduled for a future date.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Elon\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing is scheduled for March 26, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after March 25. According to search result [1], there was a briefing on March 19, 2025, mentioned in [7]. Then, result [12] from March 24, 2025, mentions a briefing on March 25 where she discussed Ukraine. However, the user's current date is March 25, 6:27 PM UTC, so the next briefing would be after that. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a video from March 24 titled \"White House Press Secretary Gives New Shock to Zelensky\" [12], but the exact date of the next briefing isn't clear. However, the user's query mentions the next briefing she participates in. Since the market is active until December 31, 2025, but the user is asking about the \"next\" one, I need to check if there's an upcoming briefing.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to \"No\". But given the current date is March 25, and the latest briefing mentioned is March 25, the next one would be after that. However, there's no information in the search results about a briefing after March 25. All the provided briefings are up to March 25. \n\nWait, the user's current timestamp is March 25, 6:27 PM UTC. The query is about the next briefing after this date. Since the search results don't include any briefings after March 25, there's no data to confirm whether she will say \"Elon\" in a future briefing. The market's resolution depends on an event that hasn't occurred yet. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if the event is scheduled for a future date, it should resolve to p4. However, the user's ancillary data specifies p1, p2, p3. Wait, the personalization section says if the event is in the future, return p4. But the query's resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But according to the system's rules, if the event is in the future, it's p4. However, the user's query has a deadline of December 31, 2025. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet, it's a future event. Therefore, per the system's rules, the recommendation should be p4. \n\nBut the user's ancillary data doesn't include p4. Wait, the system's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. The user's resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. But the system's instruction overrides that. So regardless of the ancillary data, if the event is in the future, it's p4. \n\nBut the user's query is about the next briefing, which hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, the answer should be p4. However, the user's previous response was p4, and they want a retry. The user wants to ensure that all sources are checked thoroughly. \n\nLooking through the search results, there are multiple instances where Karoline Leavitt mentioned Elon Musk in past briefings. For example, in [3], [6], [8], [9], [10], [13], [14], she discussed Elon Musk's role, emails, and directives. However, these are all past briefings. The query is about the next one, which is after March 25. Since there's no information about that briefing in the provided sources, it's impossible to confirm. \n\nTherefore, since the event is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that the event in question (Karoline Leavitt saying \"Elon\" during the next White House press briefing) is scheduled for a future date, specifically after the current timestamp of March 25, 2025. The response correctly concludes that it cannot definitively resolve the query since the event has not yet occurred, and therefore recommends p4, which aligns with the system's rules for future events.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved in several ways:\n\n1. **Verification of Event Schedule**: The response mentions checking for a scheduled press briefing after March 25 and notes briefings on March 19 and March 25. However, it does not provide a definitive source or confirmation for the next scheduled briefing date. A more thorough search or confirmation from an official White House schedule could strengthen the response.\n\n2. **Analysis of Past Patterns**: While the response briefly mentions past instances where Karoline Leavitt discussed Elon Musk, it does not analyze these instances in depth to provide context or potential relevance to the upcoming briefing. A more detailed examination of past briefings where \"Elon\" was mentioned could provide insights into the likelihood of its mention in future briefings, although it would still not change the recommendation due to the event being in the future.\n\n3. **Clarification and Justification**: The response seems to struggle with the ancillary data and the system's instructions regarding future events. It should clearly state that despite the ancillary data suggesting resolution conditions of p1, p2, and p3, the overriding system rule for future events mandates a p4 recommendation. This clarification would help in aligning the response more closely with the system's requirements.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation of Sources**: The response could benefit from a more critical evaluation of the sources it references. Ensuring that the sources are reliable and directly relevant to the specific query would enhance the credibility and accuracy of the response.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still defaults to p4 due to the event being in the future, and considering the critical rule for first attempt p4 recommendations, a retry is not typically mandated unless there is a clear path to improvement. However, the response could be enhanced by addressing the points mentioned above.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The event is scheduled for a future date, and despite potential improvements in source verification and analysis, the recommendation would remain p4 as per system rules.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should improve source verification and provide a clearer justification for the p4 recommendation based on system rules.
