The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date is March 25, 2025. The first round of the NCAA Tournament typically occurs around mid-March. Since it's already March 25th, the first round has likely concluded. The search results mention that the Sweet 16 is set, which happens after the first weekend, so the first round is over.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's no mention of any 14, 15, or 16 seed winning in the 2025 first round. In fact, result [5] states that the 2025 Sweet 16 has no teams seeded 11th or lower, except for a 10-seed Arkansas. This implies that no 14, 15, or 16 seeds advanced past the first round. \n\nAdditionally, result [11] notes that the 2025 tournament has the largest performance gaps between higher and lower seeds, predicting a lack of upsets. Since the first round is over and there's no evidence of such upsets, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The sources don't report any upsets by these seeds, so the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe 2025 NCAA Tournament's first round has concluded, with no victories by 14, 15, or 16 seeds. The Sweet 16 bracket includes only one double-digit seed (No. 10 Arkansas)[5], and analysis of the tournament's historical trends indicated this year's large performance gaps between high and low seeds made upsets particularly unlikely[11]. Since no 14-16 seeds advanced past the first round, this market resolves to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The AI correctly identified that the event in question, the first round of the 2025 NCAA Tournament, has already occurred by the current date of March 25, 2025. It also correctly noted that the Sweet 16 was set, indicating that the first round had concluded.\n\nThe response is logically sound, as it uses the information that no teams seeded 14, 15, or 16 advanced past the first round, which directly addresses the user's query about whether any of these seeds would win in the first round. The AI used verified facts from the search results to conclude that no such upsets occurred, which aligns with the resolution condition p1 for \"No.\"\n\nThe AI's verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are both correct. It used the current date and the status of the tournament (Sweet 16 being set) to infer that the first round had concluded and then checked for any upsets involving the seeds in question. Finding none, it recommended p1, which is the correct resolution based on the ancillary data provided.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI did not predict future outcomes but rather analyzed the outcomes based on established facts, which is the core function of the oracle system.\n\nGiven this analysis, the response is satisfactory and adheres to the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and logical reasoning.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907917 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:05:17 UTC"
