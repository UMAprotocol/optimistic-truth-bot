The ancillary data specifies that if the Jets win, it's p2 (Jets), Oilers win p1 (Oilers), postponed remains open, canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The search results mention the game was on March 20, 2025. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. \n\nNext, checking the results for the outcome. Multiple sources ([1], [4], [6], [8]) state that the Jets won 4-3 in overtime. Kyle Connor scored the winning goal in OT. The Oilers lost despite efforts, and key players like McDavid and Skinner were injured during the game. \n\nI also need to check if the game was postponed or canceled. All sources report the game took place as scheduled, with a clear result. No mentions of postponement or cancellation. \n\nThe resolution conditions say a Jets win is p2. Since the Jets won, the market should resolve to p2. The injuries and other game details don't affect the outcome resolution as per the ancillary data. \n\nSo, the final recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets defeated the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 in overtime on March 20, 2025, at Rogers Place. Kyle Connor scored the game-winning goal 1:13 into overtime, securing the Jets' 100th point of the season[1][6][8]. The Oilers lost Connor McDavid to a lower-body injury in the second period and goaltender Stuart Skinner to concussion protocol late in the third[1][4][6].\n\n**Key details:**\n- **Regulation goals**:  \n  **Jets**: Cole Perfetti (1st period), Josh Morrissey (2nd), Brandon Tanev (3rd)  \n  **Oilers**: Jeff Skinner (2 goals in 1st and 2nd periods), Zach Hyman (3rd period tying goal)[1][4][6]  \n- **Overtime**: Connor\u2019s wrist shot beat backup goalie Calvin Pickard, who replaced Skinner[6][8].  \n- **Injuries**: McDavid (lower body) and Skinner (concussion protocol) joined Leon Draisaitl (undisclosed, day-to-day) on the sidelines[1][4].  \n\nThe game was completed as scheduled, with no postponement or cancellation[1][4][6]. Per the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **p2 (Jets)**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the NHL game between the Winnipeg Jets and the Edmonton Oilers scheduled for March 20, 2025, appears to be accurate and complete based on the information provided in the user prompt and the system prompt instructions.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game has already occurred by the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It verifies the outcome of the game, stating that the Winnipeg Jets won against the Edmonton Oilers with a score of 4-3 in overtime. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt where a Jets win should resolve to \"p2\". The response also correctly notes that there were no postponements or cancellations of the game, which matches the conditions for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed account of the game, including scores by period, key players' performances, and injuries, which, while detailed, do not affect the resolution outcome but provide context ensuring the game's occurrence and outcome are well-supported. The logical flow from verifying the date and occurrence of the game to confirming its outcome and checking for any deviations like postponements or cancellations is clear and methodical.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response aligns perfectly with the facts as the Jets' victory directs the resolution to \"p2\". The additional details about the game's specific events and player conditions are consistent with what would be reported by reliable sports news sources, ensuring that the event is verified accurately.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the user and system prompts, focusing solely on verified facts without speculation or irrelevant details.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"p2\" based on the Jets' win is justified and well-supported by the provided evidence.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Jets vs. Oilers game, aligns with the resolution conditions, and adheres to the system prompt instructions without any factual errors or missing information.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses detailed game information to confirm the event's occurrence and outcome, ensuring a high level of accuracy and reliability in the resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
