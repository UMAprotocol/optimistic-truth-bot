The ancillary data specifies that if the Lightning win, it's p1; Flyers win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game in question has already occurred. Checking the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 4, 5, 8) report the game took place on March 17, 2025, with the Tampa Bay Lightning winning 2-0. The Flyers were shut out, and Vasilevskiy had a shutout. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no confusion with other games. The Flyers did win a previous game against the Lightning on March 12 (source 6), but the March 17 game is clearly a different one. All sources agree on the Lightning's victory here. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so the game was completed as scheduled. \n\nSince the Lightning won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All sources corroborate this outcome without any discrepancies. No conflicting information found.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Tampa Bay Lightning on March 17, 2025, concluded with a **2-0 victory for the Tampa Bay Lightning** at Amalie Arena. Andrei Vasilevskiy recorded a 21-save shutout, his sixth of the season, while Nikita Kucherov and Jake Guentzel scored for Tampa Bay[1][2][4][5][8]. The Flyers were shut out for the second consecutive game, extending their power-play drought to 0-for-23[1][2][7]. \n\n**Key details confirming the outcome:**\n- The Lightning\u2019s win improved their record to 40-24-5, solidifying their playoff positioning[8].\n- The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by detailed recaps and box scores from multiple sources[1][2][4][5][8].\n- No contradictory reports or updates about the game\u2019s status or result exist in the provided sources.\n\n**Resolution:** The market resolves to **p1 (Lightning)** based on their confirmed victory.  \nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the outcome of the NHL game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Tampa Bay Lightning on March 17, 2025, and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game has already occurred (March 17, 2025) and that the current date is March 25, 2025. It confirms the outcome of the game based on multiple reliable sources, stating that the Tampa Bay Lightning won 2-0. This outcome matches the conditions set in the user prompt where a Lightning win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a thorough analysis by checking multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome and ensuring there was no postponement or cancellation. It also distinguishes this game from another game that occurred between the same teams on March 12, demonstrating attention to detail and ensuring the resolution is for the correct event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through detailed recaps and box scores from multiple sources. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Lightning win) directly with the verified outcome and the ancillary data conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. There is no need for a rerun or default to p4, as the response is accurate, complete, and adheres to the required instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions without any errors or missing information.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and ensures that the resolution recommendation is based on verified facts and the specific conditions provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934621 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:30:21 UTC",
