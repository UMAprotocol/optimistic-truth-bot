        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Putin\" during his Kennedy Center event on March 17, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Trump saying \"Putin\" during that event. The event in question is the Kennedy Center board meeting and tour on March 17. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's activities that day. For example, result [1] and [2] describe his participation in the board meeting and tour. Result [12] includes a transcript where Trump talks about speaking with Putin the next day. Specifically, he says, \"I'm speaking with President Putin of Russia to save some soldiers...\" and later mentions, \"I'm speaking to President Putin tomorrow morning.\" \n\nThe key here is whether \"Putin\" was mentioned during the Kennedy Center event. The transcript in [12] is from the board meeting, which is part of the event in question. The user's query specifies that any statements made during the appearance, including Q&A, count. Since Trump did mention \"Putin\" in his remarks during the event, this would satisfy the condition for the market to resolve to \"Yes\". \n\nI should also check if there are any other instances across the search results. Result [3] discusses a phone call with Putin, but that's on March 18, the day after the Kennedy event. Result [6] is from February 28, so it's not relevant here. The other results focus on the Kennedy Center changes and boycotts but don't mention Putin in the context of the March 17 event. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence from [12] and possibly [11], where Trump refers to his upcoming call with Putin during the Kennedy Center event, the answer should be \"Yes\". The resolution condition p2 corresponds to \"Yes\", so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did say \"Putin\" during his March 17, 2025 Kennedy Center event. During a press interaction at the venue, Trump referenced his planned conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin the following day, stating:  \n\n> \"I'm speaking with President Putin of Russia to save some soldiers who are in deep trouble... I'm speaking to President Putin tomorrow morning\" [12][11].  \n\nThis occurred during remarks to reporters after touring the Kennedy Center and ahead of the board meeting, which qualifies as part of the event per the resolution conditions. The mention of \"Putin\" meets the criteria regardless of context, including pluralization/possessive forms.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The AI has correctly identified and verified through reliable sources that Trump did mention \"Putin\" during the event, which aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks for mentions of \"Putin\" during the event and confirms this through specific transcripts cited as sources. The response also correctly disregards mentions of \"Putin\" that occurred on different dates or in different contexts, which do not affect the resolution of this market.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The AI uses the specified resolution source, which is the video of the speech, and confirms that the term \"Putin\" was mentioned during the event, fulfilling the conditions for the market to resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI has adhered strictly to the instructions to use only verified facts and concrete evidence from the event in question.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742922915 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:15:15 UTC",
