The resolution conditions are based on whether she uses the term that many times, with specific rules on what counts. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing scheduled before the deadline. The current date is March 25, 2025. The next briefing after this date would be the one to consider. However, looking at the search results, the most recent briefings mentioned are on March 19 and March 17, 2025. The user's query is about the \"next\" briefing after March 25, but the provided search results don't include any briefings after that date. \n\nWait, the latest briefing mentioned in the sources is March 19, 2025. The user is asking about a future briefing, but the search results don't have information beyond March 25. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and there's no data on any briefings after this date, I can't verify if she said \"Putin\" five times in a future event. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, which hasn't occurred yet as of March 25. Without information on future events, I can't confirm the outcome. \n\nMoreover, the ancillary data specifies that the resolution source must be video and transcripts of the briefing. Since there's no such material available post-March 25 in the provided sources, there's no evidence to support a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information and the event being scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, the correct recommendation is p4, indicating the request can't be resolved at this time.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining the necessary information are explored before concluding that the query cannot be resolved.\n\nThe response is factually accurate in stating that there is no available information about briefings after March 25, 2025, and logically concludes that without such information, it cannot verify whether the specified event will meet the conditions outlined in the user prompt. The response also correctly aligns with the ancillary data provided, which specifies the conditions under which the market should resolve.\n\nDespite the logical and accurate handling of the query based on the information available, the critical rule for handling first attempt p4 recommendations necessitates a RETRY.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Putin\" five or more times during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the user is asking for a resolution based on verified facts up to this point.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there have been any White House press briefings involving Karoline Leavitt after March 25, 2025. The search results provided go up to March 22, 2025, with the latest mention in source [4] from March 22. The user's current date is March 25, so the next briefing after this date would be the one in question. However, the search results don't include any information about briefings occurring after March 25. \n\nLooking at the sources, the most recent briefings mentioned are on March 19, 2025 (sources [5], [7], and [9]), March 17 (sources [6], [8], [10], [14]), and March 22 (source [4]). Since the current date is March 25, the \"next\" briefing after this date hasn't occurred yet. The user's query specifies that if the event hasn't happened by the resolution date, it resolves to \"No\". But the resolution date is December 31, 2025, so the event could still happen in the future. However, the user's current timestamp is March 25, 2025, and the system prompt says to consider the event's date relative to the current timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4.\n\nWait, the query is about whether she will say \"Putin\" 5+ times in the next briefing. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet, this is a future event. According to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's query includes a URL, but the sources provided don't include any information about a briefing after March 25. The ancillary data specifies that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\", but since the event hasn't occurred yet as of March 25, we can't verify it. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4 because the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Putin\" five or more times during her next White House press briefing. Based on the current timestamp of **March 25, 2025**, the \"next\" press briefing would refer to the first one occurring after this date.  \n\n### Key Analysis:  \n1. **No Post-March 25 Briefings Documented**: The latest available search results include briefings up to March 22, 2025[4], March 19, 2025[5][7], and March 17, 2025[6][8][10][14]. There is no verifiable information about any press briefings occurring after March 25, 2025.  \n2. **Event Is Scheduled for the Future**: Since the \"next\" briefing relative to March 25, 2025, has not yet occurred, this remains a future event. Per the resolution rules, events scheduled for a future date or time must resolve to **p4** (cannot be resolved at this time).  \n3. **No Evidence of Cancellation or Postponement**: There is no indication that Leavitt has ceased to be press secretary or that future briefings are canceled.  \n\n### Recommendation: p4  \n**Rationale**: The event in question is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, and no verifiable information about its occurrence or outcome exists.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response logically concludes that since the event is in the future and no verifiable information about its occurrence or outcome exists, the recommendation should be p4, which indicates that the request cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nThe response is factually accurate in stating that there are no documented briefings after March 25, 2025, and it correctly applies the rule that if the event is scheduled for a future date, it must resolve to p4. The response also correctly notes that there is no evidence of cancellation or postponement of future briefings, which aligns with the user prompt's conditions.\n\nHowever, the critical rule for this system states that if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a retry is required. This is the second attempt, and the response still recommends p4. Given the constraints and the information available, the response appears to be the most accurate and logical conclusion based on the current data.\n\nThe response is complete in its analysis, considering all available information up to the current date and correctly interpreting the user prompt's conditions for resolution.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929045 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:57:25 UTC",
