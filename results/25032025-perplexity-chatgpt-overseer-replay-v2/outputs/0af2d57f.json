The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the St. Mary's vs. American University basketball game played on March 19, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if St. Mary's wins, it's p2; if American University wins, p1. If postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened on March 19, which is in the past. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. Next, I need to confirm the actual outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [9], [11]) report that Mount St. Mary's defeated American University with a score of 83-72. For example, source [3] from CBS Sports clearly states the final score and that Mount St. Mary's advanced. Also, source [11] from ESPN's recap confirms the same result. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled, with detailed stats and post-game reports. No sources mention a cancellation or postponement. \n\nThe ancillary data mentions \"St. Mary's\" as p2. The team in question is Mount St. Mary's, which is sometimes referred to as St. Mary's in shorthand. The search results consistently use \"Mount St. Mary's\" but given the context and the common abbreviation, it's safe to assume they're the same team. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions are clear: a win by St. Mary's (p2) is the outcome here. Since the game was played, and Mount St. Mary's won, the correct resolution is p2. There's no ambiguity here as all sources confirm the result, and the event wasn't postponed or canceled.\n</think>\n\nMount St. Mary's defeated American University 83-72 in the NCAA Tournament First Four game on March 19, 2025, as verified by multiple sources[1][3][4][9][11]. The game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation. According to the resolution conditions, a St. Mary's win corresponds to **p2**. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934261 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:24:21 UTC"
