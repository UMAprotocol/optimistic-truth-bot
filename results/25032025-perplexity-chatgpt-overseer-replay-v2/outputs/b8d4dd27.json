The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Utah Hockey Club vs. Edmonton Oilers game scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Edmonton wins, the resolution is p1 (Oilers), if Utah wins, p2 (Utah), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [5], [7]) report that the game took place on March 18, 2025, with the Oilers winning 7-1. For example, source [1] mentions the 7-1 loss, and source [5] confirms the final score and the Oilers' victory. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game as having happened, with detailed recaps. There's no indication of any cancellation or postponement. \n\nSince the game was played and the Oilers won decisively, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. All the evidence points to the Oilers' victory, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Utah Hockey Club and Edmonton Oilers on March 18, 2025, concluded with a **7-1 victory for the Edmonton Oilers**[1][3][5][7]. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. The Oilers dominated the game, scoring three goals in the first period and maintaining control throughout[1][5]. Key performances included Zach Hyman (2 goals, 1 assist) and Connor McDavid (1 goal, 2 assists)[5][7], while Utah's lone goal came from Sean Durzi[1][5].\n\n**Key details confirming the outcome:**\n- Final score: **Edmonton Oilers 7**, Utah Hockey Club 1[1][3][5][7]\n- The game was played at Rogers Place in Edmonton as scheduled[1][5]\n- No reports of postponement or cancellation in any sources\n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **p1 (Oilers)** as the Edmonton Oilers won the game decisively.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and aligns the recommendation with the facts provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the NHL game between Utah Hockey Club and Edmonton Oilers took place on March 18, 2025, and that the Oilers won the game 7-1. This outcome matches the user prompt's resolution condition for an Oilers win (p1). The response adheres to the instruction to verify the event's occurrence and outcome based on reliable sources and to ensure the event is not in the future relative to the current timestamp.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and occurrence of the event, then verifying the outcome, and finally checking for any reports of postponement or cancellation. The reasoning is thorough and leads to a clear, supported conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event through multiple sources, confirming the Oilers' victory and the absence of any postponement or cancellation. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Oilers) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is focused and directly addresses the query based on the event specifics and outcome.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the system prompt.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
