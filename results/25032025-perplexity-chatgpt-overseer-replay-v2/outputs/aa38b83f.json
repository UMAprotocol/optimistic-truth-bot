        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Bulls vs. Lakers game scheduled for March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Bulls win, it's p2; Lakers win, p1; postponed remains open; canceled is p3.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually happened. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 22. So the event date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game. \n\nSearch result [1] from SI.com states the Lakers lost to the Bulls 146-115 on March 24. Wait, the game was scheduled for March 22, but this article is dated March 24. Maybe there was a delay? Wait, no, looking at the URL in [1], the article is from 2025-03-24, and the game was on March 22. The article says the Lakers lost 146-115. Similarly, [5] from the LA Times on March 24 confirms the Bulls won 146-115. [11] and [12] also report the same score, Bulls winning. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. In fact, the search results [3] and [7] talk about other postponed games (Rockets vs. Hawks in January 2025 and a 2020 Thunder-Rockets game), but those are unrelated. The game in question here, Bulls vs. Lakers on March 22, 2025, clearly took place as multiple sources report the outcome. \n\nThe user's ancillary data says if the Bulls win, resolve to p2. All the evidence points to the Bulls winning decisively. Therefore, the resolution should be p2. No need to consider postponement or cancellation here since the game occurred and the result is well-documented.\n</think>\n\nThe Chicago Bulls defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 146-115 in their March 22, 2025 matchup, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][5][11][12]. The game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the provided search results. Key details include:\n\n- **Final score**: Bulls 146, Lakers 115[1][5][11]\n- **Historic performance**: Josh Giddey recorded 15 points, 10 rebounds, 17 assists, and 8 steals - the first NBA player to achieve this stat line[1][12]\n- **Team statistics**: Chicago shot 58.3% from the field and 46.3% from three-point range[1][5]\n\nThe Lakers' defensive struggles were notable, allowing their highest points total in a non-overtime home game since 1984[5]. LeBron James returned from injury but appeared out of rhythm, contributing to 5 turnovers[5][6].\n\nAs the game concluded without cancellation or postponement, and the Bulls secured a verified victory, the market resolution aligns with the ancillary data's defined outcome for a Chicago win.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742917114 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 15:38:34 UTC"
