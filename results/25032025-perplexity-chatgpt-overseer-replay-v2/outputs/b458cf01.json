        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Egregious\" during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the market resolves to No if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer Press Secretary by then.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there have been any press briefings after March 25, 2025, where Leavitt used the term \"egregious.\" The search results provided go up to March 23, 2025. The latest mention is from March 20, 2025, in source [4], where she called a judge's ruling on the Alien Enemies Act 'egregious.' Another instance is on March 11, 2025, in source [1], where she described Ontario Premier Doug Ford's actions as \"egregious\" and \"insulting.\"\n\nHowever, the query is about the \"next\" press briefing after the user's query date. Since the current date in the scenario is March 25, 2025, the next briefing would be after that. The provided search results don't include any briefings after March 25. The latest briefing mentioned is on March 23, 2025, in source [7], but that's about Ukraine and doesn't mention \"egregious.\"\n\nSince there's no information about briefings after March 25, 2025, and the resolution depends on events up to December 31, 2025, we can't confirm if she used the term after the query date. Additionally, the market resolves to No if no briefing occurs by the end of 2025 or if she's no longer in her role. There's no indication in the sources that she has left her position, but without data post-March 25, we can't predict future briefings.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information up to March 25, 2025, there's no evidence that she used \"egregious\" in a briefing after that date. However, since the market is still active until December 31, 2025, and future briefings could occur, but the provided sources don't cover beyond March 25, the resolution should default to p4 if the event hasn't occurred yet. Wait, the current date is March 25, 2025, and the user is asking about the next briefing after this date. Since the sources don't show any briefings after March 25, and the event (next briefing) is in the future relative to the current timestamp, per the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, we should return p4. \n\nBut wait, the query's ancillary data says the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025. However, since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet, it's a future event. According to the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, we must return p4. Even if the event is on the same day but later, it's still future. Here, the next briefing is after March 25, which is in the future. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt will say the term \"egregious\" during her next press briefing. Based on the provided search results and resolution conditions:\n\n1. **Historical Usage**: Leavitt has used \"egregious\" multiple times in press briefings between March 11 and March 20, 2025, including to describe Ontario Premier Doug Ford\u2019s actions[1][6] and a judge\u2019s ruling on immigration policy[2][4]. This establishes a pattern of using the term in official statements.\n\n2. **Current Context**: As of March 25, 2025, there is no indication in the search results that Leavitt has ceased her role as press secretary or that a future briefing has already occurred. The resolution conditions specify that the market expires on December 31, 2025, if no briefing occurs or if she leaves her position.\n\n3. **Future Event Status**: Since the \"next\" press briefing referenced in the query is a future event relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025), and no subsequent briefings are documented in the provided sources, the outcome cannot be definitively determined at this time. \n\n**Recommendation: p4**  \n*(Per the guidelines, unresolved future events default to p4.)*",

The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that it cannot definitively resolve the query since the event is scheduled for a future date. The response logically concludes that since no briefing has occurred after March 25, 2025, and the event is in the future, the recommendation should be p4, indicating that the query cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nHowever, there is a critical rule in the evaluation process that states if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a retry must always be chosen. This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues to improve the search strategy or gather more information are exhausted before settling on a p4 recommendation.\n\nThe response is factually accurate in its current state, adhering to the guidelines and using the information available up to the current date. It correctly applies the rules about future events and the conditions under which the market resolves. There is no evidence of bias or errors in the response, and it is logically sound and complete based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, due to the critical rule requiring a retry on the first attempt when p4 is recommended, the decision must be to retry the query.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Egregious\" during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if she uses the term, considering pluralization or possessive forms, but not other forms. The resolution source is video and transcripts of the briefing. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer press secretary by then.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there have been any press briefings after March 25, 2025. The search results provided go up to March 25, 2025, but the latest mentioned briefing is on March 24, 2025 (source 13), where she discussed a mineral rights deal with Ukraine. However, the transcript isn't provided, so I can't confirm if \"egregious\" was used there. \n\nLooking at the search results, the most recent briefings mentioned are on March 20, 2025 (sources 1, 4, 5), where Leavitt did use \"egregious\" multiple times in the context of a judge's ruling on deportations. For example, in source 4, she states, \"we think it's egregious that a single district judge is trying to tell the president...\" and in source 5, she repeats similar language. \n\nHowever, the query is about the \"next\" White House press briefing after March 25. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, the next briefing would be after this date. The search results don't include any briefings after March 25. Source 13 mentions a briefing on March 24, which is before the current date. \n\nThe user's query is about a future event relative to March 25, 2025. Since there's no information available yet about briefings after that date, and the market allows until December 31, 2025, for the event to occur, but the current data doesn't cover beyond March 25, we can't confirm if she used the term in a subsequent briefing. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if no briefing occurs by the end of 2025, it resolves to \"No\". Since we don't have data beyond March 25, and the event is in the future, the recommendation should be p4, indicating insufficient information to resolve as Yes or No. However, the user's personalization rules require checking if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since the next briefing hasn't occurred yet as of March 25, it's a future event, hence p4 applies.\n\nBut wait, the user's personalization rules mention that if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the ancillary data says the market resolves to \"No\" only if no briefing happens by December 31. But since the query is about the \"next\" briefing after March 25, and we don't have information on that yet, it's still pending. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4 because the event hasn't occurred yet, and there's no verifiable information post-March 25.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question, Karoline Leavitt saying \"egregious\" during the next White House press briefing after March 25, 2025, is a future event. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that it cannot resolve the query based on past or current events and must default to p4 due to the lack of information about future briefings.\n\nThe response is logically sound in its reasoning that since the next briefing has not yet occurred as of the current date, and no information is available about future briefings, it cannot confirm whether the term \"egregious\" will be used by Leavitt. This aligns with the system prompt's directive to only report on verifiable facts and established events.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by explicitly verifying whether there is any scheduled briefing after March 25, 2025, which might not have occurred yet but is planned. This would provide a more thorough analysis by checking available White House schedules or official announcements, which might indicate when the next briefing is expected to occur. This information, even if indicating a future event, would add depth to the response by acknowledging the continuity of such events and their scheduling.\n\nAdditionally, the response could enhance its completeness by discussing the implications of the resolution conditions more explicitly, particularly how the market resolves if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, or if Leavitt ceases to be White House press secretary. Mentioning these conditions explicitly would clarify the stakes and possible outcomes of the market based on the specified end date.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still defaults to p4, it is crucial to consider whether any further information could realistically change the outcome at this stage. Since the event is in the future and no further details are available about the scheduling of the next briefing, it seems unlikely that another attempt would yield a different result unless new information becomes available.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the event as a future occurrence with no available information beyond the current date, adhering to the system prompt's requirements.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742920544 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:35:44 UTC",
