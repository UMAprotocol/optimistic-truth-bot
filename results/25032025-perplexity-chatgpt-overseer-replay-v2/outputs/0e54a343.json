The user wants to know whether Viktoria Plzen or Lazio advanced in the UEFA Europa League matchup based on the provided search results. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Lazio, p2 is Viktoria Plzen, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the dates of the matches. The second leg was on March 13, 2025, as per the search results. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the match date, so the event has already occurred. No postponement or cancellation is mentioned, so p3 isn't applicable here.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [6], [9], [11]) confirm that the second leg ended in a 1-1 draw. The aggregate score from both legs is important here. The first leg, played on March 6, 2025, ended with Lazio winning 2-1 ([5], [7], [12], [13]). Adding the two legs together: Lazio had 2-1 from the first leg and 1-1 in the second, totaling 3-2 on aggregate. \n\nSeveral sources explicitly state that Lazio advanced to the quarter-finals. For example, source [1] mentions \"Lazio advanced to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals with a 1-1 draw... resulting in a 3-2 aggregate victory.\" Similarly, source [3] states, \"Lazio... qualify for the Europa League quarter-finals\" with a 3-2 aggregate. \n\nThere's no mention of the match being postponed or canceled, and all sources align on the outcome. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Lazio advanced, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources consistently report Lazio's advancement, so the answer is clear. The recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nLazio advanced to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals after a 1-1 draw in the second leg against Viktoria Plzen on March 13, 2025, securing a 3-2 aggregate victory[1][2][3]. The first leg on March 6, 2025, ended 2-1 in favor of Lazio[5][7], and the second-leg result confirmed their progression. Official match reports from UEFA and sports media outlets confirm the outcome[6][9][11], with no indications of postponement or cancellation.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929871 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:11:11 UTC"
