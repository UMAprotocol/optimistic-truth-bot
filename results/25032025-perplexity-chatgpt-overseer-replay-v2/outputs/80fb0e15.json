        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Dayton vs. Florida Atlantic basketball game played on March 19, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Dayton wins, it resolves to p2 (Dayton), if Florida Atlantic wins to p1, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was on March 19, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 25, 2025. So no issue with it being a future event. \n\nNext, looking at the search results. Multiple sources [1][2][3][4][5][8][12] report that Dayton won the game 86-79. Javon Bennett scored 30 points, leading Dayton to victory. The game was part of the NIT tournament, and Dayton advanced to the next round. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nSources like the official Dayton Flyers website [3], CBS Sports [1][2], and local news outlets [4][5][8] all confirm the score and outcome. Additionally, FAU's own coverage [12] acknowledges the loss, ending their season. \n\nNo sources indicate any postponement or cancellation. All results point to the game being completed as scheduled with Dayton as the winner. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Dayton).\n</think>\n\nThe March 19, 2025 NIT game between Dayton and Florida Atlantic concluded with Dayton defeating Florida Atlantic 86-79[1][2][3][4][5][12]. Javon Bennett led Dayton with a career-high 30 points, including eight three-pointers, while Kaleb Glenn's 18 points paced Florida Atlantic[1][3][12]. Dayton built a 19-point second-half lead and held off a late FAU rally that narrowed the gap to five points in the final minute[4][8][12].\n\nKey details confirming the outcome:\n- **Final score**: Dayton 86, Florida Atlantic 79[1][3][5][12]\n- **Tournament context**: This was a first-round NIT game, with Dayton advancing to face Chattanooga in the second round[3][8]\n- **Venue**: Played at FAU's Eleanor R. Baldwin Arena due to scheduling conflicts at UD Arena[5][10]\n- **Postseason significance**: Marked FAU's second-ever NIT appearance and first since 2011[10][12]\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1-13]. All reports explicitly state the game occurred on March 19 with a decisive result[3][4][12].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

This includes details such as the final score, key players' performances, and the context of the tournament, which aligns well with the requirements to provide concrete evidence and established facts. The AI also correctly identifies that there were no postponements or cancellations, which matches the conditions set out for different resolutions in the user prompt.\n\nFurthermore, the AI's recommendation of \"p2\" (Dayton win) is directly aligned with the definitions provided in the ancillary data, where p2 corresponds to a Dayton win. This shows proper adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926138 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:08:58 UTC"
