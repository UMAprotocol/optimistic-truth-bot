The ancillary data specifies that if Gonzaga wins, it's p1; Georgia, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 20) is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles confirm the game took place. Source [1] states Gonzaga won 89-68. Source [2] also mentions Gonzaga's victory with the same score. Sources [3], [5], and [6] all report Gonzaga's win, detailing their strong performance. The scores and details are consistent across these sources. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having happened on March 20. Therefore, the outcome is clear: Gonzaga won. According to the resolution conditions, this means the market resolves to p1. \n\nI should also check if any sources contradict this, but all point to a Gonzaga victory. No sources suggest a different result or issues with the game's completion. Thus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nGonzaga defeated Georgia 89-68 in their March 20, 2025 NCAA Tournament first-round game, as confirmed by multiple sources detailing the game's outcome[1][2][3][5][6]. The Zags dominated from the start, building a 27-3 lead early and maintaining control throughout, with key performances from Khalif Battle (24 points) and Nolan Hickman (18 points)[1][5][6]. Georgia's season ended with the loss, while Gonzaga advanced to face Houston in the second round[2][3]. The game occurred as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, meeting all resolution criteria. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a Gonzaga win corresponds to a resolution of p1. The response does not predict future outcomes or speculate but relies on verified facts from multiple sources confirming the game's result.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date of the event, confirming the event took place as scheduled, and then checking multiple sources to confirm the outcome. The response uses consistent information across various sources to substantiate the claim of Gonzaga's victory, ensuring that the resolution is based on concrete evidence.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place on the scheduled date without any postponements or cancellations. It aligns the recommendation (p1) directly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies that a Gonzaga win should resolve to p1.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's conditions and does not include irrelevant or speculative information.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of the event's outcome and the strict adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Georgia vs. Gonzaga game and aligns the resolution recommendation with the user prompt's conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, adheres strictly to the user prompt's instructions, and provides a clear and accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907080 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:51:20 UTC",
