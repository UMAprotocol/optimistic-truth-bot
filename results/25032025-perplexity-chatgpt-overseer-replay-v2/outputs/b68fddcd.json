The ancillary data specifies that if the Islanders win, it's p2; Penguins win, p1; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, check the current date: March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 18, which is in the past. So the event has already occurred. Now, need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) report that the Islanders won 4-2. For example, source [2] from TSN states the Islanders rallied with four third-period goals to win 4-2. Similarly, ESPN's recap [4] confirms the same score. The NHL.com article [9] also mentions the Islanders' comeback victory. All these sources are consistent and reliable, being from sports news outlets and official NHL sites. \n\nNo sources indicate the game was postponed or canceled. All reports are about the game happening as scheduled with a clear result. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2 (Islanders). The user's ancillary data aligns with this outcome. No conflicting information found in the search results. All citations point to the Islanders' win, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Islanders defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-2 in their NHL game on March 18, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the Islanders overcame a 2-0 deficit with four third-period goals, including tiebreaking scores from Pierre Engvall and an empty-netter by Simon Holmstrom[1][2][4][6][9]. The game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation[2][4][6].  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- Final score: Islanders 4, Penguins 2[4][10].  \n- The Islanders\u2019 third-period rally included goals from Kyle Palmieri, Noah Dobson, Engvall, and Holmstrom[2][6][9].  \n- The outcome aligns with the resolution condition specifying a win for the Islanders (p2)[1][2][4].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Islanders vs. Penguins game) occurred on March 18, 2025, and the current date is March 25, 2025, which means the event is in the past. The response then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event using multiple reliable sources, which all confirm that the New York Islanders won the game 4-2. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a win by the Islanders corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm it is a past event. It then verifies the outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the information is consistent and from credible sports news outlets and the official NHL site. The response also checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which there are none, ensuring the resolution conditions are met accurately.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is not only consistent across different platforms but also detailed, providing specifics of the game such as the final score and key players involved. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the user prompt's ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is thorough in verifying the event's details and outcome, and it adheres strictly to the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927270 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:27:50 UTC"
