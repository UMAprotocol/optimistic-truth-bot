        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"Ceasefire\" three or more times during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for mentions of that specific meeting. The user provided several sources, so I'll go through each one to find relevant information. \n\nLooking at the search results, sources [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [11], [12], and [13] mention the March 13 meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. \n\nIn source [4], the transcript from the White House shows Trump saying, \"Well, we'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia.\" That's one instance. Then later, he mentions, \"we\u2019re going to see whether or not Russia is there, and if they\u2019re not, it\u2019ll be a very disappointing moment for the world.\" But that's not using the word \"ceasefire\" again. \n\nSource [6] quotes Trump as saying, \"We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia.\" That's the same as in [4], so maybe a repeat. But the article also mentions Trump reacting to Putin's agreement in principle, but doesn't quote him using \"ceasefire\" again. \n\nSource [7] includes Trump's statement: \"We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia.\" Again, same as before. Then he refers to a \"30-day ceasefire\" proposed by the U.S. and Ukraine. That's a second instance. \n\nSource [11] and [12] both report Trump saying, \"We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia,\" and mention the 30-day ceasefire proposal. That's two uses. \n\nSource [13] discusses the ceasefire talks but doesn't add new instances from Trump during the meeting. \n\nWait, in source [4], during the Q&A, a reporter asks about Putin's openness to a ceasefire, and Trump responds, \"He did say that today. It was a very promising statement...\" But he doesn't say \"ceasefire\" again here. \n\nLooking back, the key instances are:\n1. \"We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia.\" (mentioned in multiple sources)\n2. Referring to the \"30-day ceasefire\" proposal. \n\nThat's two instances. Is there a third? Let me check again. \n\nIn source [4], after the initial mention, Trump says, \"we\u2019re going to see whether or not Russia is there, and if they\u2019re not, it\u2019ll be a very disappointing moment for the world.\" But he doesn't use the word \"ceasefire\" here. \n\nAnother part of source [4] has a reporter asking about Putin's statement on a ceasefire, and Trump responds, \"He did say that today. It was a very promising statement...\" Again, he doesn't say \"ceasefire\" himself in that response. \n\nLooking at source [7], the article mentions that Trump and Rutte discussed the ceasefire, and Trump noted that his adviser was in Russia for discussions. But the direct quotes from Trump only include two uses. \n\nIn source [11], Trump is quoted as saying, \"We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia,\" and later mentions the 30-day ceasefire. That's two. \n\nWait, in source [12], the same quotes as [11], so no additional instances. \n\nSo, based on the available transcripts and reports, Trump used \"ceasefire\" twice during the meeting. Therefore, the count is less than three. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, I need to ensure there are no other instances I missed. \n\nChecking source [14], which is an interview with Zelensky, it doesn't mention the NATO meeting. Sources [1], [2], [3], [5], [10] are about other events or dates. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that Trump said \"ceasefire\" twice, so the resolution is \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump used the term \"ceasefire\" **twice** during his March 13, 2025, meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, according to the official White House transcript and corroborating reports[4][6][7][11][12].  \n\n1. **First instance**:  \n   > *\"We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia\"* [4][6][7][11][12].  \n\n2. **Second instance**:  \n   Trump referenced the U.S.-proposed *\"30-day ceasefire\"* during discussions about the agreement[7][11][12].  \n\nNo third instance of the term was documented in transcripts or media coverage of the meeting. The resolution conditions specify that pluralization/possessive forms count, but no such variations occurred. Since the threshold of three uses was not met, the market resolves to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of the event, and alignment of the recommendation with the facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions provided in the user prompt. It correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on whether Donald Trump said \"Ceasefire\" three or more times during the specified meeting. The response also correctly notes that pluralization and possessive forms count towards the resolution, but other forms do not.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates thorough logical reasoning by checking multiple sources for instances of the word \"Ceasefire\" being used by Donald Trump during the meeting. It methodically counts the instances and concludes that the term was used twice, which is less than the required three times for the market to resolve to \"Yes\". This reasoning is well-supported by evidence from the sources cited.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event by referencing specific sources that discuss the meeting on the specified date. It aligns the recommendation with the facts gathered from these sources, concluding that the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1) because the term \"Ceasefire\" was not used three times.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or significant missing information in the response. The AI has correctly focused on the event specified in the prompt and used the appropriate sources to gather evidence.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns with the verified facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately counts the instances of the term 'Ceasefire' used by Donald Trump during the specified meeting, adheres to the prompt instructions, and logically concludes that the market should resolve to 'No'.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-supported by evidence from the specified sources. It correctly interprets the resolution conditions and applies them to the factual information obtained.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929060 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:57:40 UTC",
