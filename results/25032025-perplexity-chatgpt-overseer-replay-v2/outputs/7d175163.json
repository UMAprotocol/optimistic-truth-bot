The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Duquesne vs. St. Bonaventure college basketball game played on March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if St. Bonaventure wins, it's p1; if Duquesne wins, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 26, 2025, which is after the game's date of March 13. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking through the sources, several articles report the game's result. Source [4] from Duquesne's official site mentions St. Bonaventure won 64-59 with a late 13-1 run. Source [9] on SportyTrader confirms the final score as 64-59 in favor of St. Bonaventure. Source [12] provides a detailed box score showing St. Bonaventure's 64-59 victory. Additionally, source [11] from A10 Talk describes St. Bonaventure's comeback win, and source [13] from St. Bonaventure's official site also confirms their victory.\n\nAll these sources consistently report that St. Bonaventure won the game. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1, which corresponds to St. Bonaventure winning.\n</think>\n\nThe game between Duquesne and St. Bonaventure took place on March 13, 2025, as scheduled. According to multiple verified sources, **St. Bonaventure defeated Duquesne with a final score of 64-59**[4][9][12]. The Bonnies secured the victory with a decisive 13-1 run in the final 3:47 of the game, overcoming a late deficit[4][11]. Key performances included Melvin Council Jr. scoring 18 points and Lajae Jones adding 18 points for St. Bonaventure[12][13]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required.  \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Duquesne vs. St. Bonaventure basketball game) and its scheduled date (March 13, 2025). The current date at the time of the response is March 26, 2025, confirming that the event has occurred. The response uses multiple reliable sources to verify the outcome of the game, which is that St. Bonaventure won with a score of 64-59. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a St. Bonaventure win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the current date, confirms the event has occurred, and then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources. It ensures that there is no information about the game being postponed or canceled, which would affect the resolution. The response provides a detailed account of the game's conclusion and key performances, enhancing the credibility and completeness of the verification.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through several sources, including official sites and sports news outlets. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (St. Bonaventure win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not omit any crucial information that would be necessary for resolving the market. It strictly adheres to the facts and the user prompt's conditions without making assumptions or predictions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985596 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:39:56 UTC"
