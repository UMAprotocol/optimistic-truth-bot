The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Tulane vs. Memphis college basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Memphis wins, it's p1; if Tulane wins, p2; postponed stays open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 15, so the event should have already happened. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Sources [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], and [8] all mention the game on March 15, 2025. \n\nNext, determining the outcome. The search results consistently state that Memphis won the game 78-77. For example, source [1] says \"Memphis beat Tulane 78-77 on Saturday to advance,\" and source [3] from Tulane's own website confirms the loss. The detailed recaps in sources [4] and [5] describe the close finish, with PJ Haggerty's free throws securing the win for Memphis. \n\nI also need to check for any postponement or cancellation. All sources refer to the game being played as scheduled on March 15, with no mention of delays or cancellations. The scores and game details are consistent across multiple reports, including stats and player performances. \n\nSince the game was played on the scheduled date and Memphis won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. There's no conflicting information in the sources, and all evidence points to a Memphis victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Tulane vs. Memphis men's basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET was played as planned. Multiple sources confirm **#16 Memphis defeated Tulane 78-77** in the AAC Tournament semifinals[1][3][4][5][7]. The game featured a dramatic finish with Memphis' PJ Haggerty making critical free throws and defensive plays in the final 40 seconds to secure the one-point victory[1][4][5]. Tulane's last-second three-pointer at the buzzer narrowed the final margin to 78-77[1][3][4].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Memphis 78, Tulane 77[1][3][4][5]\n- Game occurred on schedule at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas[1][6][8]\n- No indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][3][4][6]\n\nBased on the verified outcome and resolution conditions, the market should resolve to **Memphis** (p1).\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
