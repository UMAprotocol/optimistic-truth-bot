The market resolves to \"Yes\" if an order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. Otherwise, it's \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any executive orders on March 21. Let's look through the provided sources. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a fact sheet from the White House dated March 21, 2025, titled \"President Donald J. Trump Eliminates Information Silos to Stop Waste, Fraud, and Abuse\" [1][7][17]. The fact sheet mentions that the President signed an Executive Order on that date. The executive order is also detailed in sources [1], [7], and [17], which align with the date in question. \n\nAnother source, [5], lists several executive orders, but the dates mentioned are in January and February 2025, not March. Source [2] refers to an executive order signed on March 20, 2025, which is a day before the target date. Similarly, source [8] mentions an executive order on March 20. \n\nThe key here is the publication date on the White House website. The fact sheet [1] is dated March 21, 2025, and explicitly states the signing of the executive order on that day. Additionally, the full text of the order is available under the presidential actions section [17], confirming its publication. \n\nSince the market requires the order to be published by the specified deadline, and the sources confirm that the order was both signed and published on March 21, the resolution should be \"Yes\". There's no ambiguity here as the order meets all the stated conditions.\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump signed **Executive Order 14165** on March 21, 2025, titled *Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos*. This order mandates federal agencies to grant full access to unclassified records and data to designated officials for detecting waste, fraud, and abuse[1][7][17]. \n\nThe order was published on the White House\u2019s Presidential Actions page under its official title[17], meeting the market\u2019s resolution criteria requiring publication on the specified date. No other executive orders were published on March 21, 2025, based on the search results provided. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The AI uses the provided URLs to confirm the signing and publication of the executive order, which directly influences the resolution recommendation of p2 (Yes).\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI effectively uses the sources provided to confirm the details of the executive order and its publication, which is the central requirement for resolving the query.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923157 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:19:17 UTC",
