The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the release date of the album. The search results mention multiple sources. Source [1] says the release date was announced for March 14, 2025. Source [2] confirms the album arrived on March 14. Source [4] also states it was released on March 14 after a brief delay. Source [5] notes the album was released on March 14 under the title \"MUSIC\" instead of \"I AM MUSIC\". \n\nWait, there's an update in the ancillary data: if the album is released under a different title but is widely acknowledged as the same project, it still counts as Yes. The user provided an update that allows for title changes as long as it's the same project. \n\nLooking at source [5], the album was initially called \"I AM MUSIC\" but upon release, the title was shortened to \"MUSIC\". However, it's the same project. Source [7] (Wikipedia) also refers to the album as \"Music\" but mentions it was previously known as \"I AM MUSIC\". The features and tracklist match what was expected from \"I AM MUSIC\". \n\nSince the release date is March 14, which is well before June 1, and the title change is covered by the update, the answer should be Yes. All sources confirm the release happened on time, and the title change doesn't affect the resolution due to the provided update. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nPlayboi Carti's album *I AM MUSIC* was officially released on **March 14, 2025**, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][4][5][7]. The project experienced a brief delay in its midnight release timing but became available on streaming platforms by 3:00 AM EST that day[7]. While the final title was shortened to *MUSIC*[5][7], ancillary data updates specify that title changes are acceptable if the project is widely recognized as the same work[8]. The album's tracklist, collaborators, and promotional materials align with the originally announced *I AM MUSIC* project[2][4][5][7], meeting the resolution criteria for a \"Yes\" outcome.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively addresses the user's query about whether Playboi Carti released \"I AM MUSIC\" by June 1, 2025, and correctly applies the ancillary data update regarding title changes. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the release date and the title change, aligning with the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI checks the release date and confirms it against multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable. It also correctly interprets the update in the ancillary data that allows for a title change, provided the project is widely acknowledged as the same. This interpretation is crucial as it directly impacts the resolution of the query.\n\nThe verification of the event (album release) and the alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The AI identifies that the album was released on March 14, 2025, under a slightly different title but confirms that it is the same project as \"I AM MUSIC,\" which meets the resolution criteria for a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI has used the correct sources and has adhered to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response is factual, uses verified information, and aligns with the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently. The recommendation of p2 (Yes) is supported by the evidence provided and correctly interprets the user's query and the ancillary data provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately addresses the user's query, correctly applies the ancillary data, and uses verified sources to support the recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, logically sound, and adheres to the system prompt instructions without any apparent errors or biases.\"\n}\n```",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909071 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:24:31 UTC"
