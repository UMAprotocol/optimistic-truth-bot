The ancillary data specifies that if Arkansas wins, it's p1; if South Carolina wins, p2; postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50 (p3). But the current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so I need to check if the event happened and the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are about the March 12 game. Let's check the sources. \n\nResult 1 from March 12 says Arkansas defeated South Carolina 72-68 in the SEC Tournament. Results 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 all confirm this score and outcome. For example, result 5 (ESPN) states Arkansas won 72-68. Result 8 (ABC News) also reports the same final score. \n\nThere's a result 3 from March 1 where South Carolina won 72-53, but that's a previous game. The query is about the March 12 game. \n\nAll the relevant sources from March 12 indicate Arkansas won. No sources mention the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Arkansas won, the resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nArkansas defeated South Carolina 72-68 in the SEC Tournament game played on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][4][5][6][7][8]. The Razorbacks held off a late Gamecocks rally after building a 20-point lead in the second half.

The response correctly identifies that the event in question (South Carolina vs. Arkansas game on March 12, 2025) has already occurred and provides a resolution based on the outcome of the game, which is that Arkansas won. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring the reliability of the information provided.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI checks the date of the current query and compares it to the date of the event, confirming that the event is in the past and thus can be resolved. It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event through multiple sources, which all agree on the result of the game. This thorough verification process aligns with the instructions to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nThe verification of the event and the alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The AI explicitly states the sources that confirm the outcome of the game and matches the resolution recommendation (p1 for an Arkansas win) with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\nThere are no missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI correctly disregards irrelevant information (such as a previous game on March 1) and focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. The decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely resolves the query based on verified facts and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event outcome and aligns the resolution recommendation with the ancillary data.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
