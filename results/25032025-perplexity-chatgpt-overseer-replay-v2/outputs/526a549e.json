        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the Fed will end QT before May 2025, based on whether the securities held outright increase week-over-week by April 30, 2025. The resolution source is the WSHOTSL data from the St. Louis Fed.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The deadline for the condition is April 30, 2025. So there's still about a month left. But the user provided some updates, including a Unix timestamp 1741972209, which converts to July 14, 2024. Wait, that's in 2024, which is before the current date. The update mentions that the \"Yes\" conditions have been satisfied. But how does that align with the current date in 2025?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake here. The current date in the system is March 25, 2025, but the update is from July 2024. That seems conflicting. The update says the \"Yes\" conditions were met in 2024, but the query is about an event that should resolve by April 2025. This might be a data entry error or a misunderstanding. However, according to the rules, if the user provides updates, I should heavily bias towards them. The update states that the \"Yes\" condition was satisfied, so regardless of the timestamp discrepancy, the resolution should be based on that update.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the Fed's QT timeline. Search result [1] from March 2025 says Polymarket bettors see a 100% chance the Fed ends QT before May. The Fed minutes from January discussed pausing QT, and Powell hinted at ending QT in 2025. Search result [10] from May 2024 mentions the Fed slowing QT and plans to end runoff in spring/summer 2025. However, the update provided by the user from July 2024 claims the \"Yes\" condition was met, which would mean the Fed increased securities holdings week-over-week by April 30, 2025. But if the update is from 2024, that's before the deadline. This is confusing.\n\nWait, the Unix timestamp 1741972209 is actually July 14, 2024. The update is from 2024, but the resolution deadline is April 2025. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the update is a mistake. However, according to the user's instructions, if there are updates, I must use them to update the analysis. The update says the \"Yes\" condition was satisfied, so even if the timestamp is off, per the user's ancillary data, the resolution should be \"Yes\".\n\nAdditionally, search result [11] from March 2025 mentions the Fed slowing QT runoff, which might indicate they are ending QT. The Fed Chair Powell indicated a slower drawdown, which could lead to ending QT. However, the exact week-over-week increase in securities isn't clear from the search results. But the update provided by the user overrides other sources, so the answer should be \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nThe market resolves to \"Yes\" as the provided update explicitly states that the resolution conditions for \"Yes\" have been met. According to the user's ancillary data and resolution rules, the update supersedes other considerations, even though the timestamp (July 14, 2024) precedes the April 30, 2025 deadline. This indicates the condition was verified as satisfied through the designated resolution source (WSHOTSL) prior to the deadline. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding whether the Federal Reserve will end quantitative tightening (QT) before May 2025 requires careful evaluation. The response is based on the user's prompt, which specifies that the market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the US Federal Reserve increases the amount of securities it holds outright week over week by April 30, 2025.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the source of resolution as the St. Louis Fed's WSHOTSL data and acknowledges the user-provided update stating that the \"Yes\" conditions have been met. However, there is a significant issue with the timestamp of the update (July 14, 2024), which precedes the current date (March 25, 2025) and the resolution deadline (April 30, 2025). The response initially recognizes this discrepancy but ultimately decides to accept the update at face value based on the user's instructions to heavily bias reasoning towards updates.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by analyzing the discrepancy in timestamps and the implications of the user's update. However, it fails to critically evaluate the possibility that the update could be erroneous or misinterpreted, given its premature date relative to the resolution deadline. The response does not explore alternative interpretations or seek additional verification that the conditions specified in the update were indeed met according to the primary resolution source.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not verify the event (increase in securities held outright) through the designated resolution source (WSHOTSL chart) as of the current date or any date close to the resolution deadline. Instead, it relies solely on the user-provided update, which is problematic due to its timing.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response exhibits a bias towards the user-provided update without sufficient skepticism about its accuracy given the timing issue. It also lacks a direct verification of the event from the specified resolution source near the resolution deadline.\n\nGiven these considerations, the response needs improvement to ensure accuracy and reliability. The critical issue is the reliance on an update with a timestamp that significantly precedes the resolution deadline without additional verification or consideration of potential errors.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to critically evaluate the accuracy of a user-provided update with a problematic timestamp and does not verify the event through the designated resolution source near the resolution deadline.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should include a verification of the increase in securities held outright from the WSHOTSL chart as of a date closer to the resolution deadline or provide a more thorough analysis of the implications of the premature timestamp in the user-provided update.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please verify the increase in securities held outright by checking the WSHOTSL chart for data points close to the resolution deadline (April 30, 2025) or provide a detailed analysis of the timestamp discrepancy in the user-provided update.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market prediction about whether the Fed will end QT before May 2025, based on the WSHOTSL data. The resolution condition is a week-over-week increase in securities held outright by April 30, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The deadline is April 30, so there's still time until then. But the user provided an update stating that the \"Yes\" conditions were already met. However, the timestamp of the update (1741972209) converts to July 18, 2024, which is way before the current date. That's a problem because the update is from the past and might not reflect the actual data near the resolution deadline. \n\nLooking at the search results, the FOMC statement from March 19, 2025 (source [3]) mentions slowing the pace of reducing Treasury securities, but not stopping QT. The WSHOTSL data (source [8]) goes up to March 19, 2025. If the Fed is still reducing holdings, even at a slower pace, the securities held would decrease, not increase. The user's update might be based on incorrect or outdated information. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on the WSHOTSL chart. Since the Fed hasn't increased securities yet and the update's timestamp is premature, the \"Yes\" condition hasn't been legitimately met. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1) unless there's verifiable data showing an increase by April 30. But as of now, there's no such evidence.\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether the Federal Reserve will increase securities held outright week-over-week by April 30, 2025, as measured by the WSHOTSL chart. Analysis of available data shows:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n1. The Fed's March 19, 2025 FOMC statement explicitly states they will continue reducing securities holdings, albeit at a slower pace:  \n   - Treasury redemption caps reduced from $25B to $5B/month [3]  \n   - Agency debt/MBS caps maintained at $35B/month [3]  \n   This confirms QT remains ongoing through at least April 2025.\n\n2. The WSHOTSL chart (source [8]) shows securities holdings decreasing throughout March 2025:\n   - March 12: $4.82T  \n   - March 19: $4.79T  \n   Demonstrating continued balance sheet contraction.\n\n3. The user-provided update claiming resolution conditions were met uses an invalid timestamp (July 2024) that predates both the market creation and current analysis period. This appears to be either an error or premature resolution attempt.\n\n**Critical Analysis of Sources:**\n- Polymarket's 100% confidence (sources [1][4][7]) conflicts with official Fed guidance and WSHOTSL data showing ongoing reductions.  \n- Bank of America's prediction of QT pause (source [1]) refers to debt ceiling concerns, not balance sheet expansion.  \n- The FOMC minutes cited (source [1]) discuss slowing QT pace, not reversing it.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe Fed has not increased securities holdings week-over-week as of March 25, 2025, and continues gradual balance sheet reduction per its published schedule. The user-provided update contains a timestamp discrepancy that invalidates its claim. Absent verifiable WSHOTSL data showing increases before April 30, the resolution conditions remain unmet.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately uses the specified source (WSHOTSL chart) to verify the status of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. It correctly identifies that the user-provided update has a timestamp discrepancy, which is crucial for the resolution. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on the data up to March 25, 2025, and not predicting beyond this date, in line with the requirement to report on events that have already occurred.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the information from the FOMC statement and the WSHOTSL data to conclude that the Federal Reserve has not increased its securities holdings as required for a \"Yes\" resolution. The reasoning is well-structured, moving from the verification of the current status of securities holdings to the analysis of the user-provided update's timestamp.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies that the event (increase in securities held outright by the Fed) has not occurred as of the latest available data. It aligns the recommendation (p1) with the facts derived from the primary source (WSHOTSL chart) and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors. It critically evaluates the sources and dismisses the premature and incorrect user-provided update based on the timestamp analysis. All relevant information appears to be considered, and the response is free from irrelevant data.\n\nGiven the thorough analysis, accurate use of sources, logical deductions, and strict adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, the response is satisfactory. It provides a clear and justified recommendation based on the verified facts up to the date closest to the resolution deadline currently available.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzes the available data, adheres to the resolution conditions, and provides a well-justified recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the specified sources, correctly identifies the timestamp discrepancy in the user-provided update, and aligns the recommendation with the factual status of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings as per the WSHOTSL chart.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906181 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:36:21 UTC",
