The key here is to determine the outcome of the game that was scheduled for March 25, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date provided, which is March 26, 2025. Since the game date is in the past, I need to verify if the game happened and who won. The ancillary data specifies that if the Pistons win, it's p1; Spurs, p2; postponed or canceled, p3. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [1][2][8] report the Pistons won 122-96 against the Spurs on March 25. The AP news article [1] and ESPN recap [2] both confirm the score and date. The Bleacher Report [8] also lists the final score as 122-96 for the Pistons. Additionally, YouTube highlights [3][4][5][6][7] mention the Pistons' victory, though the exact scores in the descriptions vary slightly, but the consensus from credible sources like AP and ESPN is clear.\n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources indicate it took place. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 for the Pistons winning. No conflicting information about the outcome exists, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Pistons defeated the San Antonio Spurs 122-96 on March 25, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][8]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Marcus Sasser led the Pistons with a career-high 27 points off the bench, while the Spurs were missing key players Victor Wembanyama and De'Aaron Fox[1][2]. The final score aligns with the resolution conditions specifying a Pistons victory corresponds to p1.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

It also correctly identifies that the event has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp.\n\nThe response demonstrates a thorough verification process by citing multiple sources that confirm the Pistons won the game, which aligns with the resolution condition p1 for a Pistons victory. The sources mentioned include reputable outlets like AP news and ESPN, which enhances the credibility of the information provided. The response also notes that there were no indications of the game being postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions specified for resolution.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it directly ties the verified outcome of the game to the specific resolution condition (p1) provided in the ancillary data. The response also adheres strictly to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and established outcomes without speculating or predicting.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information and stays focused on the event specified in the user prompt. It also ends with a clear recommendation that aligns with the facts verified during the analysis.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015903 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:05:03 UTC",
