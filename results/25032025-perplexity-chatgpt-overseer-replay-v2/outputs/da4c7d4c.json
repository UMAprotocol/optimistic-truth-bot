The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 19 has already occurred. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [5], [8]) report that North Texas defeated Furman 75-64 in the NIT first round. For example, source [1] states the final score was 75-64 in favor of North Texas, and source [5] confirms the same score with details about the game. Additionally, source [8] from North Texas's official site mentions their victory and advancement to the next round. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources agree on the outcome. Since the event happened and North Texas won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe March 19, 2025, college basketball game between Furman and North Texas concluded with North Texas defeating Furman 75-64 in the NIT first round[1][2][5][8].

        "response": "The evaluation of the Perplexity AI oracle response reveals that it has adhered well to the instructions provided in the system prompt and has accurately resolved the query based on the event's outcome. Here is a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Furman vs. North Texas CBB game) occurred on March 19, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources, which consistently report that North Texas won the game. This aligns with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the event date against the current date to confirm it is a past event. It then verifies the outcome through multiple reliable sources, ensuring there is no conflicting information about the game being postponed or canceled. The AI's reasoning process is thorough and leads to a clear, supported conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms the game's outcome as a win for North Texas with a score of 75-64. This is cross-verified with several sources, including official sites and sports reporting websites. The recommendation of `p1` (North Texas win) directly aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the facts and provided sources for its findings.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It has accurately and completely addressed the query based on the stipulated conditions and verified information. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the event, adhering strictly to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to verify the event outcome and provided a clear, factual resolution recommendation aligned with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907054 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:50:54 UTC",
