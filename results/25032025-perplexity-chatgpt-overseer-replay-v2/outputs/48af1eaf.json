The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Vanderbilt vs. St. Mary's basketball game based on the provided search results. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game, which was scheduled for March 21, 2025, has already occurred. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event happened on the scheduled date. The search results all mention the game took place on March 21, 2025, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. Now, I need to determine the outcome. Multiple sources, like [1], [2], [4], and [5], state that St. Mary's won 59-56. Vanderbilt's season ended with this loss, as per [6]. \n\nNext, I verify the resolution conditions. The ancillary data specifies that if St. Mary's wins, the market resolves to p1. Since the game occurred and St. Mary's won, the correct resolution is p1. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirm the result, so there's no ambiguity. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Vanderbilt and Saint Mary's occurred as scheduled on March 21, 2025, at 3:15 PM ET in Cleveland. **Saint Mary's defeated Vanderbilt 59-56** after overcoming a 12-point second-half deficit[1][2][4][5]. Key factors included:\n\n- **Saint Mary's defensive adjustments** that limited Vanderbilt to 34% shooting in the second half[4][6]\n- **Jordan Ross' 15-point performance** (13 in the second half) during Augustas Marciulionis' foul trouble[4][12]\n- Vanderbilt's late missed opportunities, including Jason Edwards' contested three-pointer with 13 seconds remaining[3][5]\n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, and no unresolved contingencies exist. Based on the resolution conditions provided:\n\n- **p1 (St. Mary's)** is the correct outcome.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926666 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:17:46 UTC"
