        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if a 1 seed lost in the first round of the 2025 NCAA March Madness Tournament. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if any 1 seed lost their first-round game, otherwise \"No\" (p1). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The system says it's March 25, 2025. The first round of the men's tournament was on March 20-21, according to the search results [1][3][7]. The women's tournament's first round was March 21-22 [5]. But the query is about the NCAA Tournament in general, so I need to check both men's and women's.\n\nLooking at the men's results: The search results mention several first-round games. For example, in [10], it says No. 1 Auburn and No. 1 Houston won their second-round games, which means they advanced past the first round. There's no mention of any 1 seed losing in the first round. The upsets listed, like McNeese (12 seed) beating Clemson (5 seed) [11], and Drake (11) over Missouri (6) [6], but no 1 seeds. The history sections [9][13] note that 16 seeds have beaten 1 seeds before, but in 2025, the only 16 vs. 1 games were won by the 1 seeds. For instance, [13] mentions that in 2023 FDU beat Purdue, but in 2025, the 1 seeds like Auburn and Houston advanced. \n\nFor the women's tournament, [14] states that all top seeds (No. 1 South Carolina, Texas, etc.) advanced past the first round, even scoring over 100 points. No upsets of 1 seeds there either.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that the resolution is based on official NCAA info. The search results from NCAA.com [1][3][7] don't report any 1 seed losses in the first round. Also, [10] and [15] discuss second-round upsets but not first-round ones involving 1 seeds. \n\nSince all 1 seeds in both men's and women's tournaments won their first-round games, the answer should be \"No\". Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe 2025 NCAA March Madness Tournament's first round concluded without any No. 1 seeds losing. All top-seeded teams in both the men's and women's tournaments advanced past their opening games. For the men's tournament, No. 1 seeds Auburn, Houston, Duke, and Florida all secured decisive victories in the first round[1][3][7][10][15]. Similarly, in the women's tournament, No. 1 seeds like South Carolina and Texas dominated their matchups, with several teams scoring over 100 points[5][14]. Historical upsets by No. 16 seeds, such as UMBC over Virginia in 2018 and Fairleigh Dickinson over Purdue in 2023, did not recur in 2025[9][13]. The absence of any first-round losses by No. 1 seeds aligns with official NCAA reports cited in the search results. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here's a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the current date and the dates of the NCAA Tournament's first round. It uses reliable sources to confirm that no #1 seeds lost in the first round of either the men's or women's tournaments. The response adheres strictly to the instructions by focusing on verified facts and not predicting or assuming outcomes without evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks both the men's and women's tournament results, which is comprehensive and ensures that all aspects of the user's question are addressed. It provides specific examples of games and outcomes to substantiate the claim that no #1 seeds were defeated in the first round.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the facts gathered from these sources. The decision to recommend p1 is based on concrete evidence from the tournament results, which matches the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The AI has correctly used the sources to gather information about the specific event in question, without deviating from the user's requirements.\n\nGiven the thoroughness, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934434 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:27:14 UTC",
