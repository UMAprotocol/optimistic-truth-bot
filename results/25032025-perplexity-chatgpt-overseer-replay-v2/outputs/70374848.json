The ancillary data specifies that if Oklahoma wins, the market resolves to \"Oklahoma\" (p2), if Georgia wins, it's \"Georgia\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 12, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [5]) report that Oklahoma defeated Georgia 81-75 in the SEC Tournament first round on March 12. For example, source [1] states Jeremiah Fears scored 29 points leading Oklahoma to victory. Source [3] confirms the final score as 81-75 with Oklahoma as the winner. Additionally, source [5] mentions Georgia's loss ending their four-game streak. \n\nSome sources like [4] and [6] had predictions favoring Georgia, but the actual result is clear from the post-game reports. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All evidence points to the game being completed with Oklahoma winning. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Oklahoma).\n</think>\n\nOklahoma defeated Georgia 81-75 in the SEC Tournament first-round game played on March 12, 2025, as scheduled[1][2][3]. The Sooners secured victory through a decisive 10-0 run late in the second half, led by Jeremiah Fears' game-high 29 points and 4 three-pointers[1][2][5]. Key details:\n\n**Game outcome**\n- Final score: Oklahoma 81, Georgia 75[1][3]\n- Oklahoma advanced to face Kentucky in the second round[2]\n- Georgia's four-game win streak was snapped[5]\n\n**Performance highlights**\n- Oklahoma shot 52% in first half with 10 three-pointers[1]\n- Georgia's Silas Demary Jr. scored 24 points, while Asa Newell had 21 points/17 rebounds[2][5]\n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, meeting all scheduled conditions. No evidence suggests any irregularities affecting the result.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the query based on the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Oklahoma vs. Georgia college basketball game) and its scheduled date (March 12, 2025). It verifies that the event has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). The response then proceeds to confirm the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which report that Oklahoma won against Georgia with a score of 81-75. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where Oklahoma's win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and then gathers evidence from reliable sources to determine the outcome. It provides specific details from the game, including scores and key performances, which not only supports the resolution but also adds depth to the verification process. The response concludes that there was no postponement or cancellation, which matches the conditions provided for resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively uses multiple sources to verify the event's outcome. It ensures that the recommendation (p2) directly corresponds to the verified outcome of the event as per the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on verified facts and avoids any speculative or unverified information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it adheres closely to the system prompt instructions, accurately verifies the event based on reliable sources, and aligns the recommendation with the verified facts and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-structured, providing a clear and factual resolution based on the event's outcome.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742919226 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:13:46 UTC"
