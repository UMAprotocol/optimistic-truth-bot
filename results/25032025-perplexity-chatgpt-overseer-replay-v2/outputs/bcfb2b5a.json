First, I need to check if the event date is in the past relative to the current date, which is March 25, 2025. Since March 12 is earlier, the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, all the sources [1] through [8] report that the Oklahoma City Thunder won the game against the Boston Celtics with a score of 118-112. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so the resolution conditions don't apply to those scenarios. The ancillary data specifies that if the Thunder win, the market resolves to \"Thunder\" (p2). All sources confirm the Thunder's victory, so the correct resolution is p2. No conflicting information is present, and the event details match the user's query. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Boston Celtics 118-112 in their March 12, 2025 matchup[1][2][3][4][6][7][8].

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Thunder vs. Celtics game on March 12, 2025) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It verifies through multiple sources that the Oklahoma City Thunder won the game, which aligns with the user's resolution conditions. The response adheres strictly to the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts and not to predict outcomes.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm it has occurred. It then verifies the outcome of the event through multiple sources, ensuring that the game was neither postponed nor canceled. This thorough verification supports the resolution recommendation directly.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response confirms the event's occurrence and its outcome (Thunder win) through multiple sources, which is consistent with the user prompt's ancillary data. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Thunder\" (p2) is directly aligned with the specified conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not exhibit any unnecessary information or deviation from the required facts.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the user prompt's resolution conditions based on the verified outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the Thunder vs. Celtics game, adhering to the system prompt instructions and user prompt conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to verify the event's outcome and provided a clear, accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930903 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:28:23 UTC",
