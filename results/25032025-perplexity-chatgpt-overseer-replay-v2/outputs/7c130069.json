The ancillary data specifies that if the Predators win, it's p2; if the Hurricanes win, p1. If postponed, it stays open, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the date. The current date is March 26, 2025, so the game was yesterday. That means it's in the past, so no need to worry about postponement or cancellation. Now, I need to confirm the result of the game.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources report the game's outcome. Source [1] states the Predators won 3-1. Source [4] also mentions a 3-1 victory for Nashville. The YouTube video in [7] and the recap in [5] both confirm the same score. Additionally, [8] from a local news site reports the Hurricanes were swept by the Predators with a 3-1 loss. \n\nAll sources consistently show that Nashville won. The Hurricanes' coach, Rod Brind'Amour, even credited Saros, the Predators' goalie, for the win in [4] and [6]. There's no conflicting information about the result. \n\nSince the game happened, and the Predators won, the market should resolve to p2. No signs of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Nashville Predators defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3-1 in their NHL game on March 25, 2025[1][4][5][7]. Key highlights include:\n\n- **Luke Evangelista** scoring two goals for Nashville, including the game-winning tip-in shot in the third period[1][5][7].\n- **Juuse Saros** making 34 saves to secure his 200th career win[1][4][5].\n- **Taylor Hall** scoring Carolina\u2019s lone goal, extending his streak to four consecutive goals for the team[1][4][5].\n\nThe Predators\u2019 victory was sealed by their efficient scoring despite being outshot 35-16[1][5]. Carolina\u2019s head coach Rod Brind'Amour acknowledged Saros\u2019 pivotal role, stating, \"That guy won them the game tonight\"[4][6]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743017378 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:29:38 UTC"
