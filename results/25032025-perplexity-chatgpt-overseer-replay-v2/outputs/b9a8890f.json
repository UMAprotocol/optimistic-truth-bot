The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Alcorn State vs. Bethune-Cookman game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Bethune-Cookman wins, it's p1; Alcorn State, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 13 is definitely in the past. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome of the game using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([1], [2], [6], [8], [9]) report that Bethune-Cookman defeated Alcorn State 69-60 in the SWAC Tournament quarterfinal on March 13. For example, source [1] states the final score clearly, and [9] from ESPN confirms the same result. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution conditions for those scenarios don't apply. \n\nI should also check if there are any conflicting reports, but all the sources from March 13 and 14 consistently report Bethune-Cookman's victory. Other sources like [3] and [12] discuss previous meetings between the teams but aren't relevant to the March 13 game. \n\nSince the event occurred, and the result is well-documented with multiple credible sources, the market should resolve to p1 as Bethune-Cookman won. There's no ambiguity here, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nBethune-Cookman defeated Alcorn State 69-60 in the SWAC Tournament quarterfinal on March 13, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources including ESPN and Associated Press reports[1][2][6][8][9]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: **69-60** in favor of Bethune-Cookman[1][8]\n- Bethune-Cookman advanced to the SWAC semifinals[1][2]\n- Alcorn State\u2019s season ended with an 11-21 record[6][9]\n\nThe outcome meets the resolution condition for **p1** (Bethune-Cookman win) as defined in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Bethune-Cookman win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event is in the past. It then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple credible sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The response also correctly identifies that there were no indications of the game being postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions outlined for resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has used the correct sources to verify the event's outcome and has not included irrelevant or unverified information. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is based on verified facts that Bethune-Cookman won the game, which is the exact condition specified for a p1 resolution in the ancillary data.\n\nGiven the thorough verification and alignment with the user prompt's conditions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple credible sources and aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, adheres to the instructions, and provides a clear and accurate resolution based on the event's verified outcome.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928090 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:41:30 UTC"
