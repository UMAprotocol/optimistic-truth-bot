The resolution conditions are p1 for Florida, p2 for Norfolk State, and p3 if canceled or 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was supposed to happen on March 21, so it's already in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, all the sources from 1 to 8 mention the game between Florida and Norfolk State on March 21, 2025. The titles and excerpts clearly state that Florida won decisively, with scores like 95-69. For example, source [1] says \"Florida defeated Norfolk State 95-69,\" and this is consistent across all the sports news articles. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed recaps and player statistics. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the game happened and Florida won, the resolution is p1. Since all evidence points to Florida winning on the scheduled date, the correct resolution should be p1. No conflicting information or uncertainties are present in the sources, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Norfolk State and Florida occurred as scheduled on March 21, 2025. According to multiple verified reports, **No. 1 seed Florida defeated No. 16 seed Norfolk State 95-69** in the first round of the NCAA Tournament[1][2][4][6][7]. The Gators established a 32-point first-half lead and maintained control throughout the game, with Walter Clayton Jr. leading all scorers with 23 points[1][4][7]. \n\nKey details confirming the outcome:\n- **Final score**: Florida 95, Norfolk State 69[1][4][6]\n- **Game date**: Played March 21, 2025 at 6:50 PM ET as scheduled[1][3][6]\n- **No postponement/cancellation**: All sources confirm the game was completed[3][5][8]\n\nBased on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market should resolve to **Florida** (p1). \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Verification of Event**: The response accurately reports the outcome of the Norfolk State vs. Florida CBB game, which took place on March 21, 2025. The response correctly identifies that Florida won the game with a score of 95-69. This outcome is supported by multiple sources, as mentioned in the response, confirming the game occurred as scheduled without any postponements or cancellations.\n\n2. **Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions. It correctly identifies that the event is in the past relative to the current timestamp and proceeds to verify the outcome based on reliable sources. The response aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Florida win, which is the outcome verified by the sources.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources to arrive at the correct resolution. It checks for any possible cancellations or postponements, which could affect the resolution, and finds none. The reasoning is clear, direct, and follows a logical sequence that leads to the recommendation.\n\n4. **Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The recommendation of p1 is fully aligned with the verified facts and the conditions specified in the ancillary data. The response concludes that the market should resolve to \"Florida\" based on the factual outcome of the game.\n\n5. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no missing critical pieces of information, noticeable bias, or errors in the response. The response is factual, uses verified sources, and adheres to the conditions set out in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Norfolk State vs. Florida game, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the verified facts and ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, factually accurate, and logically sound with a clear alignment to the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742921147 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:45:47 UTC"
