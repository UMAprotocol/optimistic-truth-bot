        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will issue an executive order on March 22, 2025, and the market resolves based on whether such an order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The query is about March 22, so that's three days prior. The user provided several search results, so I need to look through them for any executive orders dated March 22. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of the executive orders mentioned are from dates before March 22. For example, the Department of Education order was signed on March 20 and 21. The \"Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness\" order is dated March 19. There's also an order from March 20 about consolidating procurement. \n\nNow, checking result [14], which is the White House presidential actions page. The latest entries there are from March 22, including a presidential memorandum titled \"Rescinding Security Clearances and Access to Classified Information from Specified Individuals.\" However, the user specified that executive orders count, not other presidential actions like memoranda. The query explicitly states that executive actions (like memoranda) do not qualify. \n\nResult [15] is a presidential memorandum from March 22, which again isn't an executive order. The other entries on the presidential actions page around March 22 include memoranda and executive orders from March 20 and 21, but none from March 22. \n\nThe key point here is distinguishing between executive orders and other presidential actions. Since the market resolution depends solely on an executive order being published on that specific date, and the only March 22 actions are memoranda, the answer should be \"No.\" Even though there are actions on that day, they don't meet the criteria of being executive orders. Therefore, the market resolves to p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results and the current date of March 25, 2025, there is no evidence that President Trump issued an executive order on March 22, 2025. The White House presidential actions page shows:\n\n1. Three March 22, 2025 actions - all classified as **Presidential Memoranda** rather than executive orders:\n   - \"Rescinding Security Clearances and Access to Classified Information from Specified Individuals\" [15]\n   - \"Preventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court\"\n   - \"Addressing Remedial Action by Paul Weiss\" [14]\n\n2. The most recent executive orders listed are from **March 20-21, 2025**, including:\n   - Education Department closure order (March 20-21) [3][7][11]\n   - Procurement consolidation order (March 20) [8]\n   - State/local preparedness order (March 19) [2]\n\nThe resolution conditions specify that **only executive orders** (not memoranda or other actions) qualify, and they must appear on the White House presidential actions page or Federal Register by noon ET on March 23. No executive orders meeting these criteria were published for March 22.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the query pertains to whether Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 22, 2025. It correctly distinguishes between executive orders and other types of presidential actions, such as memoranda, which are not relevant to the market's resolution criteria. The response uses the specified URLs to verify the presence or absence of an executive order on the specified date, adhering to the user prompt's instructions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically examines the available data from the White House presidential actions page, noting the types of documents published on March 22, 2025, and confirming that none were executive orders. It correctly concludes that since no executive orders were issued on that date, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The reasoning is clear, follows a logical sequence, and addresses the specific requirements of the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event (issuance of an executive order on March 22, 2025) did not occur by checking the specified source (White House presidential actions page). The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (No) is directly aligned with the verified facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the required information and does not include irrelevant details. It strictly adheres to the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924324 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:38:44 UTC",
