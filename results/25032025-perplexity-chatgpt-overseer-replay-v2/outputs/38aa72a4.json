The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Columbus Blue Jackets vs. Pittsburgh Penguins game scheduled for March 21, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Blue Jackets win, it's p2; Penguins win, p1; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so it's in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources [1][3][5][6][7][8] report the game took place on March 21. For example, source [1] mentions the Penguins beat the Blue Jackets 6-3. Source [7] also confirms the Penguins' 6-3 victory with Crosby scoring. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the recent results. Sources [4] talk about NHL postponements in 2021, which is irrelevant here. All other sources from 2025 discuss the game as having occurred. \n\nSince the game was played and the Penguins won, the resolution should be p1. Need to ensure there's no conflicting info about the game being postponed or canceled. All evidence points to the game being completed with a Penguins victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Columbus Blue Jackets and Pittsburgh Penguins on March 21, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET was played as scheduled. The Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets with a final score of **6-3**[1][7][8]. Key details from the game include Sidney Crosby scoring his 25th goal of the season and Alex Nedeljkovic making 44 saves for the Penguins[1][7]. The Blue Jackets lost their sixth consecutive game, failing to close the gap in the Eastern Conference wild-card race[1][8]. \n\nNo evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in the search results, and all sources confirm the game occurred on the scheduled date. Based on the ancillary data, the market resolves to **\"Penguins\"** (p1). \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
