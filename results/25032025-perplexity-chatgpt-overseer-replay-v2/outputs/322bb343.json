The ancillary data specifies that if George Mason wins, it's p1; if St. Joseph's wins, p2; postponed stays open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened 10 days ago. That means I should look for verified outcomes. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13]) report that George Mason defeated St. Joseph's 74-64 in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament semifinal on March 15. For example, source [6] from ABC News and [9] from the official George Mason athletics site confirm the score and that George Mason advanced to the final. The box score in [12] also shows George Mason's 74-64 victory. \n\nI need to ensure there's no confusion with other games. There's a mention of a women's game on March 10 where George Mason won ([5]), but the query is about the men's game on March 15. All relevant sources point to the men's game result. \n\nSince the event occurred, and George Mason won, the resolution should be p1. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nGeorge Mason defeated Saint Joseph's 74-64 in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament semifinal on March 15, 2025, as verified by multiple sources including official game recaps and box scores[6][7][9][12]. The game occurred on the scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **George Mason** (p1) as the winning team.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that the event (St. Joseph's vs. George Mason game) occurred on March 15, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, which places the event in the past. The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event using multiple sources, confirming that George Mason won the game with a score of 74-64. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a George Mason win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the event date against the current date, searching for verified outcomes, and ensuring that the sources referred to the correct event (men's game on March 15). It also correctly disregards irrelevant information (such as the women's game on March 10).\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The AI uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the outcome, and there is no indication of postponement or cancellation, which would have affected the resolution.\n\nThere are no missing information, bias, or errors detected in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the instructions, focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question without making assumptions or predictions.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929081 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:58:01 UTC"
