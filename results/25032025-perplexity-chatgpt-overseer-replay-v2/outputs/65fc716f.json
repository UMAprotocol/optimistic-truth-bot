        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if MicroStrategy will buy 200 or more Bitcoin in their next purchase between March 18, 2025, 8:10 PM ET and April 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The answer needs to be based on official sources from MicroStrategy or Michael Saylor, and the resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the latest search results provided. The most recent information is from March 24, 2025 (source [4] and [12]), where MicroStrategy bought 6,911 BTC for $584 million. That's well above 200 BTC. The next purchase after that would be the one in question. \n\nLooking at the timeline, the current date in the system is March 25, 2025. The query period starts on March 18, so the March 24 purchase falls within this window. However, the user is asking about the \"next\" purchase after the query's start date. Since the last purchase was on March 24, which is within the period, the next purchase would be after that date. But the resolution period ends on April 30, so we need to determine if there's any indication of another purchase before April 30.\n\nThe search results mention that MicroStrategy has a consistent pattern of purchasing Bitcoin, often using proceeds from stock sales. For example, sources [3] and [12] discuss their strategy of raising funds through stock offerings to buy more Bitcoin. Additionally, Michael Saylor has a history of hinting at purchases through social media, as seen in sources [2], [3], and [7]. \n\nHowever, the latest info from March 24 (sources [4] and [12]) shows they just made a large purchase. There's no mention in the provided search results of any purchases after March 24. The company's 21/21 plan aims to raise $42 billion over three years, which suggests ongoing purchases, but the next one hasn't been announced yet within the query's timeframe. \n\nSince the resolution depends on an official announcement between March 18 and April 30, and the last known purchase is March 24, we need to check if there's any upcoming purchase hinted. The search results don't provide any information about a purchase after March 24. Without an official announcement or hint from Saylor within the remaining period (March 25 to April 30), we can't confirm a \"Yes\". \n\nTherefore, unless there's an announcement in the remaining time, the answer would default to \"No\". However, considering MicroStrategy's aggressive buying pattern, there's a high likelihood they might make another purchase. But since the resolution requires official confirmation within the timeframe, and none is present in the provided data, the safe answer based on available info is \"No\". But wait, the March 24 purchase is within the query period (March 18 to April 30), so if that's their next purchase after March 18, then it's a \"Yes\". But the user's query is about the \"next\" purchase after the market's start date. If the March 24 purchase is the first one after March 18, then the answer is Yes. But the user's query is whether they will buy 200+ in their next purchase within the period. Since the March 24 purchase is within the period and is 6,911 BTC, which is over 200, then the answer should be Yes. Wait, but the user's query is about the next purchase after the market's start date. If the March 24 purchase is the next one after March 18, then the answer is Yes. But the market resolves based on whether they buy 200+ in any purchase during the period. So if they made at least one purchase of 200+ BTC between March 18 and April 30, it's Yes. The March 24 purchase is within that window and is 6,911 BTC, so the answer should be Yes (p2). But I need to confirm the dates. The search result [4] and [12] mention March 24, 2025, as the date of the purchase. Since the query period starts on March 18, 2025, 8:10 PM ET, the March 24 purchase is within that window. Therefore, the market should resolve to Yes because they did buy 200+ BTC during the specified period. The user might have intended the \"next\" purchase after the query's creation date, but according to the resolution conditions, it's any purchase within the timeframe. Hence, the answer is Yes.\n</think>\n\nMicroStrategy's most recent Bitcoin purchase occurred on March 24, 2025, when the company acquired **6,911 BTC** for $584 million[4][12]. This transaction falls within the resolution window defined in the query (March 18, 2025 \u2013 April 30, 2025) and exceeds the 200 BTC threshold specified in the ancillary data. The purchase was officially disclosed in regulatory filings[12], meeting the requirement to use MicroStrategy's own announcements as resolution sources.\n\nThe company has maintained an aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy throughout 2024-2025, with:\n- 11 consecutive weekly purchases in January 2025[6][7]\n- A $2 billion convertible note offering specifically for Bitcoin purchases[3]\n- Total holdings surpassing 500,000 BTC as of March 2025[4][12]\n\nWhile future purchases between March 25 and April 30 remain possible given MicroStrategy's established pattern of using stock sales to fund acquisitions[12], the confirmed March 24 purchase alone satisfies the resolution criteria for a \"Yes\" outcome. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929784 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:09:44 UTC",
