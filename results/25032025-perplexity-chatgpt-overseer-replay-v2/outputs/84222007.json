        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump issued an executive order on March 19, 2025, based on the provided search results. The resolution conditions specify that the answer is \"Yes\" (p2) if the order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. Otherwise, it's \"No\" (p1). \n\nFirst, I need to check all the search results for any mention of an executive order signed on March 19. Let's go through each relevant source. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of the executive orders mentioned are from January, February, and March 2025, but the specific dates vary. For example, result [1] mentions an order from March 14, 2025, rescinding previous orders. Result [3] and [5] discuss an executive order signed on March 20 about closing the Education Department. Result [7] is a fact sheet from March 14. \n\nResult [14] lists executive orders signed in 2025, including EO 14238 on March 14 and others up to March 14. The list doesn't show any orders on March 19. Result [16] from March 19, 2025, tracks all executive orders up to that date, and the latest mentioned is March 14. The user's current date is March 25, so if there was an order on March 19, it should have been published by March 20 at 12 PM ET. \n\nNone of the search results reference an executive order published on March 19. The closest are orders on March 14 and March 20. Since the requirement is for the order to be published by the deadline, and there's no evidence of such an order on March 19, the answer should be \"No\". Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results, there is no evidence that President Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 19, 2025. The most recent executive orders mentioned in the sources are:\n\n- **March 14, 2025**: Executive Order 14148 rescinded 78 Biden-era orders[1][7], and EO 14236 revoked 19 additional Biden actions[7][14].  \n- **March 20, 2025**: An executive order directing the closure of the Department of Education was signed[3][5][15][17].  \n\nThe Federal Register and White House presidential actions page show no executive orders published on March 19, 2025[1][14][16]. The latest tracked orders as of March 19, 2025, were from March 14[16].  \n\n**Resolution**: Since no executive order was published by the March 20, 12 PM ET deadline, the market resolves to \"No.\"  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions provided in the user prompt. It correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on whether an executive order was signed by Donald Trump on March 19, 2025, and published by the specified deadline. The response uses the correct sources as stipulated in the prompt, checking the White House presidential actions page and the Federal Register.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the sources mentioned. It checks for the presence of an executive order on the specified date and finds none. The reasoning is sound, as it confirms the absence of an executive order on March 19 by checking the latest available orders up to and including that date.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that no executive order was issued on March 19, 2025, by checking the relevant sources. It aligns with the facts presented in the sources and correctly concludes that the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1) since no order was published by the deadline.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks the specified sources and bases its conclusion on the absence of an executive order on the required date.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory.

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906166 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:36:06 UTC",
