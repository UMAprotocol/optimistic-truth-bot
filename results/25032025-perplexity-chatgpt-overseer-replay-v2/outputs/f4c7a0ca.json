The ancillary data specifies that if the Golden Knights win, it's p2 (Golden Knights), if the Wild win, p1 (Wild), and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 26, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to determine who won. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] states that the Golden Knights defeated the Wild 5-1. Similarly, sources [3], [4], [6], [7], [9], and [12] all report the same score with Eichel's hat trick leading Vegas to victory. The scores are consistent across these sources, so there's no discrepancy. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game happening as scheduled on March 25, with detailed recaps. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. \n\nThe resolution conditions say a Golden Knights win resolves to p2. Since all evidence points to a 5-1 Vegas win, the market should resolve to p2. There's no conflicting information, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Vegas Golden Knights defeated the Minnesota Wild 5-1 in their NHL game on March 25, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][3][6][9][12]. Jack Eichel led the Golden Knights with a hat trick, his fifth career three-goal performance, while Adin Hill made 23 saves[1][3][6]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][3][6][9][12].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Golden Knights 5, Wild 1[1][3][6]\n- Vegas extended their winning streak to four games[3][6][9]\n- Minnesota's disallowed goal in the third period (ruled high stick) prevented a potential 2-2 tie[1][6]\n- The Golden Knights scored three unanswered goals in the final 5:03[1][6][9]\n\nBased on the resolution conditions and the verified outcome, the market should resolve to \"Golden Knights\" (p2).\n\nrecommendation: p2",

This level of detail supports the accuracy of the event's reporting and the final recommendation.\n\nThere are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The AI has adhered strictly to the facts as required, and there is no indication of reliance on unverified or irrelevant sources. The response aligns perfectly with the ancillary data and resolution conditions provided, ensuring that the recommendation is based on verified outcomes.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015885 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:04:45 UTC"
