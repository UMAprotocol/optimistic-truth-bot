The ancillary data specifies that if the Canucks win, it's p2; if the Devils win, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([2], [6], [8], [12]) report that the Canucks won 4-3 in a shootout. Specifically, Jonathan Lekkerimaki scored the deciding goal in the shootout. \n\nNext, I need to ensure that the event wasn't postponed or canceled. The detailed game summaries and stats from sources like NHL.com and ESPN confirm the game took place as scheduled. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the results. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that a shootout win counts as a win for the team, so Vancouver's victory should resolve to p2. All sources align on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The Devils' loss means the market resolves to \"Canucks,\" which is p2. No conflicting information is present, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks defeated the New Jersey Devils 4-3 in a shootout on March 24, 2025. Jonathan Lekkerimaki scored the decisive shootout goal in the fourth round, marking his first career shootout attempt[2][6][8]. The game remained tightly contested, with three lead changes in the third period before Pius Suter tied it 3-3 for Vancouver with 36 seconds remaining in regulation[8][12]. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Vancouver's Thatcher Demko made 22 saves in his first start since returning from a six-week injury[7][8].\n- New Jersey's Timo Meier scored two goals in regulation, while Erik Haula added another[2][8].\n- The Canucks improved to 33-26-12, keeping their Western Conference wild-card hopes alive[2][8].\n- The Devils (37-28-7) earned a standings point but lost their third straight game[8][12].\n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **\"Canucks\"** (p2) as Vancouver secured the victory. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
