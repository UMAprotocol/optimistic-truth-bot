The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Canucks vs. Blues game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Canucks win, it's p2; if the Blues win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open until completion; and if canceled, it resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the game was played. For example, source [1] from ESPN shows the final score as Blues 4, Canucks 3 in overtime. Source [4] and [5] on YouTube confirm the Blues won 4-3 in OT with Philip Broberg scoring the winner. The box score in source [6] also lists the Blues as the victors. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources reference the game occurring on March 20, with detailed stats and highlights, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that a cancellation would result in p3, but since the game was played, that's not applicable.\n\nNow, verifying the outcome: multiple sources agree the Blues won 4-3 in overtime. Even though the Canucks forced OT with a late goal, the Blues secured the win in OT. According to NHL rules, overtime wins count as regular wins for the purpose of standings and betting resolutions. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 (Blues). There's no ambiguity here as all evidence points to a Blues victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks vs. St. Louis Blues NHL game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET was played as planned. According to multiple verified sources, the **St. Louis Blues defeated the Vancouver Canucks 4-3 in overtime**[1][4][6]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- Regulation ended tied 3-3 after Vancouver's Brock Boeser scored a last-minute goal to force overtime[4][5].\n- Blues defenseman Philip Broberg scored the overtime winner at 3:54 of the extra period[1][4].\n- Official box scores and video highlights confirm the Blues' victory[1][4][6].\n\nSince the game was completed without postponement or cancellation, and the Blues won under standard NHL overtime rules, the market resolves based on the ancillary data's defined outcomes for a Blues victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Canucks vs. Blues game took place on March 20, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. It correctly states that the St. Louis Blues won the game in overtime, which aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, which enhances the reliability of the information provided.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It checks for the occurrence of the game, confirms it was not postponed or canceled, and verifies the winner based on reliable sources. The reasoning is clear and follows a structured approach to arrive at the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is not based on a single source. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Blues win) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Blues victory.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not exhibit any unnecessary deviations from the user prompt or ancillary data. All necessary checks (game occurrence, outcome, and conditions for resolution) are adequately addressed.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It adheres strictly to the user prompt instructions, uses verified facts to make a resolution, and logically processes all necessary information to arrive at an accurate conclusion.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908002 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:06:42 UTC"
