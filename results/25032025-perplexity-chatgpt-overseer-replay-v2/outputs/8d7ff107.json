        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the Vikings will re-sign Sam Darnold by September 4, 2025, 5:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether he signs an extension or gets franchise tagged. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any official statements or credible reports about Darnold's contract status. From the sources, it's clear that the Vikings didn't use the franchise tag on him (sources [1], [2], [7], [10], [12], [17]). That's a point towards \"No\" if the tag was a factor, but the main condition is an extension.\n\nLooking at recent updates, source [3] mentions that Darnold signed a 3-year deal with the Seahawks on March 10, 2025. That's a key point. If he's already signed with another team, the Vikings can't re-sign him. Additionally, source [9] states that Darnold is not expected to return to the Vikings, and they're focusing on other QB options. Source [13] also reports that he decided not to return, and source [18] confirms his contract with Seattle.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that using the franchise tag would resolve to \"No,\" which they didn't do. However, since Darnold has already signed with the Seahawks, the answer is definitively \"No.\" The resolution conditions say p1 is \"No,\" so the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nSam Darnold will not re-sign with the Minnesota Vikings, as he agreed to a three-year, $100.5 million contract with the Seattle Seahawks on March 10, 2025[3][18]. The Vikings opted against using the franchise tag (which would have resolved this market to \"No\" per the ancillary data) and instead allowed Darnold to enter free agency, where he secured a multi-year deal with Seattle[1][2][7][10]. Minnesota is now focused on other quarterback options, including 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy and veteran Daniel Jones[9][17]. Since Darnold has already signed with another team, the condition for resolving this market to \"Yes\" (an extension with Minnesota by September 4, 2025) cannot be met.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that Sam Darnold has signed with the Seattle Seahawks, which is a key fact in determining the resolution of the market. The response also correctly notes that the Minnesota Vikings did not use the franchise tag on Darnold, which aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically deduces that since Darnold has signed with another team, the condition for him re-signing with the Vikings (an extension by September 4, 2025) cannot be met. This reasoning is sound and follows from the facts presented.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event (Darnold's signing with the Seahawks) through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p1, corresponding to \"No\") with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. This shows a thorough verification process and correct application of the resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses on the specific event in question and uses credible sources to confirm the details necessary for resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It adheres strictly to the user prompt's instructions, uses verified facts to make a logical conclusion, and aligns the recommendation correctly with the ancillary data. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event of Sam Darnold signing with the Seahawks and logically concludes that he will not re-sign with the Vikings, aligning the recommendation correctly with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses verified sources effectively, and adheres closely to the user prompt's conditions for resolution.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742919498 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:18:18 UTC"
