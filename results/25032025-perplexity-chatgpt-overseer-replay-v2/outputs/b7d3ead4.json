The ancillary data specifies that if Jackson State wins, it's p1; Bethune-Cookman, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 14 is definitely in the past. No need to consider postponement or future dates here.\n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find out who won. The first three results ([1], [2], [3]) all mention Jackson State defeating Bethune-Cookman 71-50 in the SWAC Tournament semifinals. For example, result [1] states, \"Jackson State Tigers defeated the Bethune-Cookman Wildcats 71-50.\" Similarly, result [6] from ESPN confirms the same score and outcome. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. Results [7], [8], and [9] talk about other sports (baseball and football) between the same schools, but those are different events and dates, so they're irrelevant here. Results [4] and [5] discuss earlier basketball games, but the March 14 game is clearly covered in the first few results. \n\nThe user's resolution conditions are straightforward: Jackson State's win is p1. All reliable sources confirm Jackson State won the game on March 14. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Bethune-Cookman vs. Jackson State men's basketball game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET concluded with Jackson State defeating Bethune-Cookman 71-50 in the SWAC Tournament semifinals[1][2][3][6]. The Tigers controlled the game from the first half, building a 35-24 halftime lead and maintaining dominance throughout the second half behind Daeshun Ruffin's 25-point performance[1][2]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions where a Jackson State victory corresponds to p1.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Bethune-Cookman vs. Jackson State game occurred on March 14, 2025, and that Jackson State won the game with a score of 71-50. This is in line with the user prompt's conditions for resolution, where a win by Jackson State corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event is in the past and therefore eligible for resolution. It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event through multiple sources, confirming the win by Jackson State. The response also correctly ignores irrelevant information about other sports and games involving the same teams on different dates.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation of p1 aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a win by Jackson State.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question and uses verified sources to confirm the outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It adheres strictly to the instructions, uses logical reasoning, verifies the event accurately, and aligns the recommendation with the facts and conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources, adheres to the user prompt instructions, and logically aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used verified sources to confirm the event outcome and correctly ignored irrelevant data, ensuring a focused and accurate resolution.\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908482 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:14:42 UTC"
