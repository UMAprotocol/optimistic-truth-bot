The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Memphis Grizzlies vs. Utah Jazz game scheduled for March 25, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Grizzlies win, it's p2; if the Jazz win, p1; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current date provided is March 26, 2025, 7:04 PM UTC. The game was supposed to be on March 25, which is the day before. Since the current date is past the event date, I need to check if the game happened and its result.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [2] from CBS Sports mentions the game on March 25, 2025, with the headline \"Bane scores 21 and Grizzlies use dominant second half to dispatch Jazz, 140-103.\" That's a clear indication the Grizzlies won. Source [5] from Wikihoops also states the same score, 140-103, confirming the Grizzlies' victory. Additionally, source [8] from Fox Sports lists the final score as Grizzlies 140, Jazz 103. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All relevant results point to the game taking place as scheduled with a decisive win by the Grizzlies. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Grizzlies).\n</think>\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Utah Jazz 140-103 in their March 25, 2025 NBA game[2][5][8]. The Grizzlies dominated the second half, with Desmond Bane scoring 21 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. contributing 19 points[5]. This result aligns with the Grizzlies' season-long dominance over the Jazz, completing a 4-0 season sweep[8]. \n\nThe game occurred as scheduled on March 25 at 9:00 PM ET, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any verified sources[2][5][8]. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to \"Grizzlies\" (p2).\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The AI used multiple sources (CBS Sports, Wikihoops, Fox Sports) to confirm the result of the game, which aligns with the user prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and time of the event relative to the current timestamp, then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (p2 for a Grizzlies win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI effectively verifies that the game occurred as scheduled without any postponements or cancellations. It aligns the recommendation (p2) with the verified outcome of the game, which is a Grizzlies win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI strictly adheres to the user prompt and system instructions, using only the specified sources for its analysis.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Grizzlies\" (p2) is based on concrete evidence and established facts, fulfilling the oracle's primary function.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event using multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
