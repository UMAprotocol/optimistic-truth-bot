The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Florida Atlantic vs. Tulane basketball game scheduled for March 14, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Florida Atlantic wins, the market resolves to p2 (Florida Atlantic), if Tulane wins, it's p1 (Tulane), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on or before the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 14, 2025, which is in the past. So the event has already taken place. \n\nNext, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [2] from the American Athletic Conference's official site states that Tulane defeated Florida Atlantic 83-76 in the quarterfinals on March 14. Similarly, [8] from Tulane's official website confirms the same score, Tulane winning 83-76. Another source, [11] from the Associated Press via WTOP, also reports Tulane's victory with the same score. Additionally, [12] from SportyTrader lists the final score as 83-76 in favor of Tulane. \n\nAll these sources are reliable and consistent in reporting Tulane as the winner. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Tulane won, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. The prediction articles like [1], [3], [4], [5], [7], and [13] had varying predictions, but the actual result is clearly reported in multiple credible sources. The final score from the game is consistent across these reports. \n\nNo sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. All results point to the game being completed as scheduled with Tulane as the winner. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Florida Atlantic vs. Tulane college basketball game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET was played as planned. According to multiple verified sources, **Tulane defeated Florida Atlantic 83-76** in the AAC Tournament quarterfinals[2][8][11][12]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, and Tulane advanced to the semifinals.  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided:  \n- **Tulane's victory** triggers a resolution to **p1**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome of the game using multiple reliable sources, all of which consistently report that Tulane won the game. This outcome aligns perfectly with the user prompt's resolution conditions, which state that a Tulane victory should resolve to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and then verifies the outcome using several credible sources. The response also correctly ignores any predictive or speculative information, focusing solely on the verified results of the event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the information's reliability and accuracy. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is directly based on these verified facts, which is in full compliance with the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has not used any irrelevant or unverified sources and has strictly adhered to the facts as required.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927575 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:32:55 UTC"
