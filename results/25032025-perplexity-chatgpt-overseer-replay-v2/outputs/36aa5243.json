The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game was on March 18 at 11 PM EDT. Results [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], and [12] all report the game took place with Stanford winning 87-70. \n\nNext, confirm the outcome. Multiple sources, including the Associated Press and ESPN, state Stanford's victory. The final score is consistent across these sources. \n\nSince the event occurred and Stanford won, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to \"Stanford,\" which is p1. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for p1 resolution.\n</think>\n\nStanford defeated CSU Northridge 87-70 in their National Invitation Tournament (NIT) first-round game on March 18, 2025. The Cardinal led 46-29 at halftime and maintained their advantage throughout the second half, with Maxime Raynaud recording a double-double (22 points, 11 rebounds) and five blocks[3][5][6][8].

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately states that the CSU Northridge vs. Stanford game occurred on March 18, 2025, and that Stanford won with a score of 87-70. This information aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution. The response correctly identifies that the event has already occurred and provides a detailed account of the game, including scores and standout performances, which matches the information required to resolve the query.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by first verifying the occurrence of the event and then confirming the outcome through multiple reliable sources. It correctly concludes that since Stanford won, the market should resolve to \"Stanford\" (p1), as per the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The response does not unnecessarily delve into irrelevant details and stays focused on the event in question.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the reliability of the information. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Stanford win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include any irrelevant or unverified information and strictly adheres to the facts needed for resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
