        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt said the word \"Astronaut\" during her next White House press briefing after the market was created. The resolution depends on whether she used the term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any press briefings by Leavitt after the query date. The current date given is March 25, 2025. The search results include several briefings from March 19, 2025, which is before the current date. For example, sources [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [9], and [12] all mention her March 19 briefing. \n\nIn these briefings, she discussed the return of astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. Looking at the transcripts, she uses the word \"astronauts\" multiple times. For instance, in [1], she says \"these two incredible astronauts\" and refers to them as \"astronauts\" again. Similarly, [3] quotes her saying \"these two incredible astronauts were only supposed to be up there for eight days.\" The plural form \"astronauts\" is used, which according to the resolution conditions, counts toward a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that pluralization and possessive forms count. Since \"astronauts\" is the plural of \"astronaut,\" this meets the criteria. The term is used in context, but the rules state any usage counts regardless of context. Therefore, even though she's talking about specific astronauts, the plural form is still valid.\n\nAdditionally, there's no indication in the search results that she ceased being Press Secretary before the briefing, so the market doesn't resolve to \"No\" for that reason. All the March 19 briefings are before the current date of March 25, so they are valid events to consider.\n\nNo conflicting information suggests she didn't use the term. All sources mentioning the March 19 briefing confirm her use of \"astronauts.\" Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe market resolves based on whether White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt used the term \"Astronaut\" (including plural/possessive forms) during her next press briefing after the market's creation.  \n\n**Key evidence from March 19, 2025 press briefings:**  \n1. Leavitt repeatedly used the plural form \"astronauts\" while discussing NASA\u2019s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, stating:  \n   - \"These two incredible **astronauts** were only supposed to be up there for eight days\" [1][3][5][7][9]  \n   - \"President Trump directed Elon Musk and SpaceX to rescue these brave **astronauts**\" [1][3][6][12]  \n   - \"The president looks forward to welcoming Butch and Suni [...] when they are recovered\" [3][6][7]  \n\n**Resolution analysis:**  \n- The plural \"astronauts\" explicitly matches the resolution condition allowing pluralizations of the term.  \n- The term was used in official White House briefings on March 19, 2025, which occurred before the current timestamp (March 25, 2025).  \n- No evidence suggests Leavitt ceased her role as press secretary before the briefing.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The term \"astronaut\" (in plural form) was used in the specified context, fulfilling the market\u2019s resolution criteria.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. The response effectively analyzed the user prompt, which asked whether Karoline Leavitt said \"Astronaut\" during her next White House press briefing. The AI checked for any press briefings by Leavitt after the query date and found relevant briefings on March 19, 2025, before the current date of March 25, 2025. It confirmed that Leavitt used the term \"astronauts\" multiple times during these briefings, which meets the resolution criteria specified in the user prompt that pluralization of the term counts toward a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it correctly identifies that the plural form \"astronauts\" is valid under the resolution conditions provided. The AI also correctly disregards any potential resolution to \"No\" based on Leavitt ceasing to be Press Secretary, as there was no indication of such an event occurring before the briefing.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The AI used multiple sources to confirm the usage of the term \"astronauts\" in the context of the press briefing, and it aligned its recommendation (p2) with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI strictly adhered to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, ensuring that its evaluation was limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. The decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely adheres to the system prompt instructions, correctly verifies the event, and aligns the recommendation with the established facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used the provided information and sources to confirm the usage of the term 'astronauts' in the specified context, leading to a correct resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923296 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:21:36 UTC",
