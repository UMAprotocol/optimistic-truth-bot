        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the North Carolina vs. San Diego State game. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the ancillary data provided. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 9:10 PM ET. The current date given is March 26, 2025, which is after the event date. So the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify the actual outcome of the game. Looking through the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [6], [8]) report that North Carolina (UNC) won the game 95-68 against San Diego State (SDSU). These sources are from reputable outlets like the Associated Press, university sports sites, and news articles. They all confirm the score and that UNC advanced in the tournament.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if UNC wins, the market resolves to \"North Carolina\" (p2). Since the game wasn't postponed or canceled, and the result is clear from the sources, there's no need to consider p3 or p1. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. All the search results consistently report UNC's victory. Some sources even mention the controversy around UNC's selection but confirm their dominant performance. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution conditions are met for p2.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2, as North Carolina definitively won the game.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between North Carolina and San Diego State occurred on March 18, 2025, as scheduled. North Carolina defeated San Diego State 95-68 in a First Four matchup at UD Arena in Dayton, Ohio[1][2][3][6][8]. The Tar Heels dominated offensively, shooting 60.9% from the field in the first half and making 14 three-pointers overall[1][3][6]. RJ Davis led all scorers with 26 points, including a perfect 6-6 from three-point range[1][3][8].\n\n**Key details confirming the outcome:**\n- Final score: UNC 95, SDSU 68[1][2][3][6][8]\n- UNC advanced to face Mississippi in the South Region first round[1][3]\n- The game was completed without postponement or cancellation[1][6]\n- Multiple verified sources (AP News, university athletics departments, CBS Sports) corroborate the result[1][3][6][8]\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985694 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:41:34 UTC"
