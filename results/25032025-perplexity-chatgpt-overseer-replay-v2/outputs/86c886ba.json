        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know whether AS Roma or Athletic Bilbao advanced in the UEFA Europa League matchup based on the provided ancillary data. The resolution conditions are p1 for Athletic Bilbao, p2 for AS Roma, and p3 if the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The event in question is the second leg of the Round of 16, which according to the search results took place on March 13, 2025. Since the event date is in the past, there's no issue with it being postponed or canceled, so p3 is out of the question.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [12], [13]) confirm that Athletic Bilbao won the second leg 3-1 against AS Roma. The aggregate score was 4-3 in favor of Athletic Bilbao, overturning Roma's 2-1 first-leg advantage. Key events include Mats Hummels' red card in the 11th minute of the second leg, which left Roma with 10 men, and Nico Williams scoring twice for Bilbao. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to the advancing team. Since all sources agree that Athletic Bilbao progressed, the correct resolution should be p1. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources consistently state Bilbao's advancement. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nAthletic Bilbao advanced to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals by defeating AS Roma 4-3 on aggregate in their Round of 16 matchup. After losing the first leg 2-1 in Rome, Athletic Bilbao overturned the deficit with a 3-1 victory in the second leg at San Mam\u00e9s on March 13, 2025[1][2][6][8]. \n\nKey factors in the tie included:\n- **Mats Hummels' 11th-minute red card** for Roma in the second leg, leaving them with 10 players for nearly 80 minutes[3][4][6].\n- **Nico Williams' brace**, including a crucial first-half stoppage-time goal and a late solo effort to seal the win[1][5][13].\n- **Yuri Berchiche's header** in the 68th minute that gave Bilbao their first aggregate lead[2][4][6].\n\nWhile Roma's Leandro Paredes converted a late penalty (90'+3'), it only served as a consolation goal[6][8]. The result means Athletic Bilbao progressed to face Rangers/Fenerbah\u00e7e in the quarter-finals, keeping alive their chance to contest the final at their home stadium, San Mam\u00e9s[1][8].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924709 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:45:09 UTC"
