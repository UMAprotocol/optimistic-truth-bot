The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the election date was officially scheduled by that deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the official announcement date. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. Source [1] from Elections Canada, dated March 23, 2025, states that the 45th federal general election will be held on April 28, 2025. It mentions that Elections Canada offices are opening soon, which indicates the election has been called.\n\n2. Source [2] is a YouTube video from CBC News dated March 22, 2025, where sources confirm the election date as April 28. Prime Minister Carney was expected to ask the Governor General to dissolve Parliament on March 23.\n\n3. Source [3] from Immigration News Canada, dated March 23, 2025, explicitly states that PM Carney met with the Governor General on March 23 to dissolve Parliament and called the election for April 28. This directly confirms the election was scheduled by March 23.\n\n4. Source [7] from the Vancouver Sun, also dated March 23, 2025, confirms the election was called on that day with the date set for April 28.\n\n5. Source [8] from Le Monde, dated March 23, 2025, reports that Carney called the snap election on March 23, with the election scheduled for April 28.\n\nAll these sources agree that the election was officially called on March 23, 2025, which is the deadline specified in the query. The ancillary data requires the election to be scheduled by March 23, 11:59 PM ET. Since the announcement was made on March 23, the condition is met. Therefore, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe next Canadian federal election was officially scheduled by March 23, 2025, meeting the market's resolution criteria. Prime Minister Mark Carney requested the dissolution of Parliament on March 23[1][3][7][8], with Governor General Mary Simon setting the election date for April 28, 2025[2][3][6]. This announcement occurred within the required timeframe (before March 23, 11:59 PM ET)[3][7], triggering the shortest legally permitted 37-day campaign[5][6]. Multiple authoritative sources including Elections Canada[1], CBC News[2], and international outlets confirm the election was formally declared by the deadline[3][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926430 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:13:50 UTC",
