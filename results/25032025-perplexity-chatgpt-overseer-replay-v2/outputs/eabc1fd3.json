        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Arkansas vs. Kansas NCAA Tournament game on March 20, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Arkansas wins, the market resolves to \"Arkansas\" (p2), and if Kansas wins, it resolves to \"Kansas\" (p1). If the game is postponed or canceled, it resolves accordingly. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the event's occurrence. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game's scheduled date of March 20. So the event has already taken place. Next, I check the search results to determine the outcome. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple reports (1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13) state that Arkansas defeated Kansas 79-72. For example, source [1] from the Arkansas Razorbacks' official site clearly states the victory. Additionally, the ESPN recap [11] and CBS Sports [2] both confirm the score and Arkansas's advancement. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game as completed. Kansas's loss is noted as their first first-round exit since 2006 [2][9]. Key players like Jonas Aidoo and Johnell Davis are highlighted for their contributions to Arkansas's win. \n\nSince the event occurred as scheduled and Arkansas won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information or future dates are mentioned, so there's no need for a p3 or p4 resolution. The recommendation is straightforward based on verified results.\n</think>\n\nArkansas defeated Kansas 79-72 in the NCAA Tournament First Round game played on March 20, 2025, as verified by multiple sources including official team websites[1][12], sports news outlets[2][9][11], and game recaps[4][6][13]. The Razorbacks overcame an 11-point second-half deficit by Kansas, with Jonas Aidoo leading all scorers with 22 points and Johnell Davis contributing 18 points including crucial late free throws[1][2][11]. Kansas' loss marked their first opening-round NCAA Tournament exit since 2006[2][9].\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Based on the resolution conditions defined in the ancillary data, the market should resolve to **Arkansas** (p2) as the decisive outcome meets the criteria for a completed event with a verified winner.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909961 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:39:21 UTC"
