The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Nathan Fletcher vs. Caol\u00e1n Loughran fight at UFC Fight Night on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Loughran wins, it's p1; if Fletcher wins, p2; and if there's a draw, postponement, or cancellation, it's p3 (50-50). The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the fight's outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [2] from Fightful.com lists the result as Caolan Loughran def. Nathan Fletcher by split decision. That's a direct mention of the result.\n- Source [4] from Cageside Press confirms Loughran's split-decision victory over Fletcher, providing details about the fight rounds.\n- Source [8] from MMA Decisions breaks down the judges' scores, showing Loughran won via split decision with two judges scoring 29-28 in his favor and one judge scoring 28-29 for Fletcher.\n- Source [5] is a YouTube video where Loughran discusses his split-decision win post-fight, which adds another layer of confirmation.\n- The other sources provide context about the fighters' records and the event but don't contradict the outcome.\n\nAll credible sources agree that Loughran won the bout. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. The resolution conditions state that ESPN is the primary source, but a consensus of credible reporting can be used. Since multiple reliable sources (Fightful, Cageside Press, MMA Decisions) confirm Loughran's victory, the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe bout between Nathan Fletcher and Caol\u00e1n Loughran at UFC Fight Night: Leon Edwards vs. Sean Brady on March 22, 2025, concluded with **Caol\u00e1n Loughran** winning via split decision (29-28, 28-29, 29-28) as verified by multiple credible sources[2][4][8]. The fight occurred as scheduled, and no postponement, cancellation, or draw was reported. \n\n**Key details**:  \n- Two judges scored the fight 29-28 for Loughran, while one judge scored it 28-29 for Fletcher[8].  \n- Post-fight reports from Fightful, Cageside Press, and MMA Decisions all confirm Loughran\u2019s victory[2][4][8].  \n- The result aligns with the resolution source (ESPN) and consensus reporting[1][2][8].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907386 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:56:26 UTC"
