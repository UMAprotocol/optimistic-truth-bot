        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will make Canadians visiting the U.S. register before April, specifically by March 31, 2025. The ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if such a policy is implemented by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any official announcements or credible reports about a registration requirement. Let's go through the sources. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions Canada updated its travel advisory on March 25, 2025, stating that Canadians staying over 30 days need to register with USCIS starting April 11. The rule is set by the Trump administration. That's a key point. \n\nResult [2] from Boundless.com on March 12 says the U.S. will enforce a rule requiring registration and fingerprints starting April 11. But wait, result [3] from Heron Law on March 19 clarifies that Canadians don't need biometrics, just registration. There's a discrepancy here. \n\nResult [6] from Axios on March 12 also talks about the April 11 effective date, part of an executive order. The rule was published in the Federal Register on March 12, which is an official source. \n\nResult [9] from Dentons on March 24 explains the DHS rule effective April 11, 2025, under Trump's executive order. It confirms the registration requirement but notes exemptions. \n\nResult [12] from a law firm's site states the effective date is April 11, but the requirement was officially announced before March 31. The Federal Register notice on March 12 is the official announcement. \n\nThe key is whether the policy was announced by March 31. The DHS published the interim final rule on March 12, 2025, which is before the deadline. Even though the rule takes effect in April, the announcement was made in March. The ancillary data says any officially announced requirement by March 31 qualifies, regardless of the effective date. \n\nSo, multiple credible sources, including official DHS publications, confirm the announcement before March 31. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a new registration requirement for Canadian citizens staying in the United States for **30+ consecutive days**, effective April 11, 2025. This policy change was formally published in the Federal Register on **March 12, 2025**[6][9][12], meeting the March 31, 2025 deadline specified in the resolution conditions.\n\n### Key Details of the Registration Rule:\n- **Announcement Date**: March 12, 2025 (via Federal Register)[6][9]\n- **Effective Date**: April 11, 2025[1][3][6]\n- **Requirements**:\n  - Canadians aged 14+ must register via USCIS Form G-325R[7][12]\n  - Exempts those with valid I-94 admission records[10]\n  - No fingerprinting required for Canadians[3][4][12]\n  - Penalties for noncompliance: Up to $5,000 fines or 6 months imprisonment[8][12]\n\n### Official Basis:\nThe rule stems from President Trump\u2019s January 20, 2025 executive order directing DHS to enforce Section 262 of the Immigration and Nationality Act[9][11]. While the requirement itself has existed since 1940, this marks the first strict enforcement targeting Canadians entering via land borders[4][12].\n\n### Credible Reporting Consensus:\nMultiple authoritative sources confirm the policy\u2019s announcement and implementation timeline, including:\n- U.S. Federal Register notice[6][9]\n- Canadian government travel advisory updates[1][9]\n- Immigration law firms[3][7][12]\n- Major news outlets (Axios, NYT)[1][2][6]\n\nSince the resolution conditions specify that **any officially announced requirement by March 31, 2025** qualifies regardless of effective date, this market resolves to **Yes** (p2). \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930473 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:21:13 UTC",
