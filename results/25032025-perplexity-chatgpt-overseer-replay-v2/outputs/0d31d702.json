        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Philadelphia 76ers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder game scheduled for March 19, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Thunder win, it's p1; if the 76ers win, p2; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was supposed to happen on March 19, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [1] is a box score from Fox Sports showing the Thunder won 133-100. The date matches March 19, 2025. The title mentions \"Thunder throttle 76ers\" and highlights Jaylin Williams' triple-double. That's a strong indicator.\n\nResult [2] is a YouTube video transcript recapping the game, stating the Thunder beat the Sixers 133-100. It also mentions the Thunder's ninth wire-to-wire win and Jaylin Williams' triple-double. This corroborates the Fox Sports report.\n\nResult [3] and [6] are game highlights from YouTube, but the transcripts mention the Thunder's dominant performance, including a 133-100 scoreline. Result [4] is another video titled \"OKC Thunder BEAT DOWN 76ers, CLINCH Division Title,\" which again confirms the Thunder's victory and division clinching on March 19.\n\nResult [5] is a prediction article from March 20, but the actual game result is already available in other sources. Result [7] from Sports Illustrated explicitly states the Thunder's 133-100 win, highlighting Jaylin Williams' career-high performance. Result [8] shows a previous game's box score, but the date is January 15, 2025, so not relevant to the March 19 game.\n\nAll credible sources agree the Thunder won decisively on March 19. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Thunder).\n</think>\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 133-100 on March 19, 2025, in a game where the Thunder dominated wire-to-wire[1][2][7]. Key factors included:\n\n**Offensive Execution**  \n- Oklahoma City set a franchise record with **24 made three-pointers** and tallied **36 assists**, showcasing elite ball movement[2][7].  \n- Seven Thunder players scored in double figures, led by Aaron Wiggins (26 points) and Isaiah Joe (21 points)[2][7].  \n\n**Defensive Impact**  \n- The Thunder limited Philadelphia to 38% shooting from the field while forcing 18 turnovers[1][7].  \n- Oklahoma City's league-leading steals average (10.5/game) was evident through active hands in passing lanes[7].  \n\n**Standout Performances**  \n- Jaylin Williams recorded a **career-high triple-double**: 19 points, 17 rebounds, and 11 assists[1][2][7].  \n- Chet Holmgren added 19 points and 5 blocks, anchoring both the offense and defense[7].  \n\nThe game was never in doubt, with Oklahoma City leading by 14 after the first quarter and extending the margin to 33 by the fourth[1][3]. No indications of postponement or cancellation appear in any verified sources[1-8].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that the game has already taken place and proceeds to gather evidence from multiple sources to confirm the outcome.\n\nThe response demonstrates a thorough approach by cross-referencing various sources, including Fox Sports, YouTube video transcripts, and Sports Illustrated, all of which confirm the Thunder's victory. This multi-source verification ensures the accuracy of the event's outcome, aligning with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event is in the past and then verifies the outcome through reliable sources. The response also correctly applies the ancillary data from the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Thunder win, leading to the recommendation of p1.\n\nThere are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the event specified in the user prompt without deviating to unrelated events or outcomes. It also correctly ignores irrelevant data, such as a prediction article dated after the game, focusing solely on verified outcomes.\n\nOverall, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event and the conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event using multiple reliable sources and correctly applies the ancillary data to reach a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses a multi-source verification strategy to ensure the accuracy of the event outcome and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923249 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:20:49 UTC"
