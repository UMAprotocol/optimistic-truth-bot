The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the period in question is from March 21 to March 28. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of \"Kamala\" by Trump within the specified timeframe. The search results include several instances where Trump has talked about Kamala Harris, but I need to check the dates. \n\nLooking at the search results, the most recent one is from March 25, 2025 (result [9]), where Trump comments on Kamala Harris possibly running for governor. He says, \"Let her run... she's gotta start giving interviews.\" Here, he uses her first name, \"Kamala,\" which fits the criteria. \n\nAnother relevant result is [13], dated March 22, 2025, where Trump revoked security clearances for Kamala Harris. The mention of her name in this context would count. \n\nResult [19] from March 23, 2025, also discusses Trump giving advice to Kamala, using her first name. \n\nSince the time frame is March 21 to March 28, and these instances fall within that window, especially the March 25 mention, it's clear that Trump has mentioned \"Kamala\" during this period. The resolution condition for \"Yes\" (p2) is met. There's no ambiguity here because there are multiple verified instances within the timeframe. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

It aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts presented and the conditions outlined for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the query's requirements and provides evidence for its resolution recommendation.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation of p2 is well-supported by the evidence provided, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies instances where Donald Trump mentioned 'Kamala' within the specified timeframe, adhering to the resolution conditions and providing a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the information available to resolve the query based on the specified conditions without any evident errors or biases.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935518 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:45:18 UTC",
