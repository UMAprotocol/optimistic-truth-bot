        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Pocahontas\" during his Digital Asset Summit speech on March 20, 2025. The resolution conditions are specific: if he used the term, it's a \"Yes\" (p2), otherwise \"No\" (p1). The updates mention that the video address counts, so the main source is the actual speech video.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of \"Pocahontas\" during that specific event. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles about the Digital Asset Summit. Let's look through the provided search results.\n\nSearch result [1] is about Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit. It mentions his support for crypto but doesn't reference \"Pocahontas\". Similarly, [4], [5], [8], [12], [15], and [16] discuss the summit and his crypto policies but no mention of the term. \n\nLooking at other results, [2], [3], [6], [7], [9], [10], [11], [13], and [14] all reference Trump using \"Pocahontas\" in other contexts, like Congress speeches or past events. However, the query specifically asks about the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. \n\nThe transcript from the summit in [5] and [12] doesn't include the term \"Pocahontas\". The video address transcript in [5] shows Trump talking about crypto policies, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and other initiatives, but there's no mention of Elizabeth Warren or the slur. \n\nAdditionally, the Blockworks article [9] mentions Trump using \"Pocahontas\" at a Bitcoin conference in 2024, but that's a different event. The 2025 Digital Asset Summit speeches, as per the transcripts and reports, focus solely on crypto and related policies without any derogatory terms towards Warren.\n\nSince the resolution depends on the specific speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, and all available evidence from that event doesn't include the term, the answer should resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nBased on analysis of the video transcript from President Trump's March 20, 2025 Digital Asset Summit address[1][5][12], there is no evidence he used the term \"Pocahontas\" during this specific event. The 30-minute speech focused entirely on cryptocurrency policy, including:\n\n- Announcing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve[1][5]\n- Ending Biden-era crypto regulations[1][12]\n- Legislative efforts for stablecoin rules[1]\n- Expanding US dominance in blockchain technology[5][12]\n\nWhile Trump has used \"Pocahontas\" as a slur against Senator Elizabeth Warren in other contexts[2][6][9][13], including a March 4, 2025 congressional address[2][13] and a July 2024 Bitcoin conference[9][11], this derogatory term does not appear in the official transcript or video evidence from the March 20 Digital Asset Summit speech that this market specifically references[1][5][12].\n\nThe resolution conditions specify that only statements made during the main speech or its immediate Q&A qualify[ancillary_data]. All verified sources about this particular event confirm the remarks stayed focused on digital asset policy without personal attacks[1][4][5][8][12][15][16].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response uses the correct sources, such as video transcripts and articles, to verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking through various sources to confirm whether the term \"Pocahontas\" was mentioned during the event. It distinguishes between the specific event and other instances where Trump might have used the term, ensuring that the resolution is based on the correct context. The response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to make an informed decision based on the evidence provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and scrutinizes the content of Trump's speech during the Digital Asset Summit. It confirms that the term \"Pocahontas\" was not used in any part of the speech or its immediate Q&A, aligning perfectly with the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The AI has correctly focused on the event specified in the prompt and used the appropriate sources for verification.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation of p1 (No) is well-supported by the evidence provided and aligns with the resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the system prompt instructions, uses logical reasoning, and is complete.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933806 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:16:46 UTC",
