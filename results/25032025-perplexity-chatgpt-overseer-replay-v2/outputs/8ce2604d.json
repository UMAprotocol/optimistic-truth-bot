The user wants to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the Charlotte vs. Rice college basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Charlotte wins, the market resolves to \"Charlotte\" (p2), if Rice wins, it's \"Rice\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 12, so the game should have already happened. Let me look through the search results to find the outcome. \n\nSearch result [1] is an article titled \"Rice Basketball falls to Charlotte in AAC Tournament\" dated March 12, 2025. The final score mentioned is Charlotte 64, Rice 61. That's a clear indication that Charlotte won the game. \n\nLooking at [4], another source from Rice's official site, it confirms the same score and outcome. Additionally, [7] from Fox Sports also lists the final score as Charlotte 64, Rice 61. All these sources agree that Charlotte won the game on March 12. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the search results. All reports discuss the game as having taken place on the scheduled date. Therefore, the conditions for postponement or cancellation don't apply here. \n\nSince the game was played and Charlotte won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Charlotte). The other search results about betting odds and prediction markets don't affect the outcome since the actual game result is confirmed by multiple sources. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The other search results [2], [3], [5], [6], [8]-[19] discuss previous games, betting trends, or prediction market regulations, but none contradict the March 12 game result. \n\nTherefore, the resolution is straightforward: Charlotte won, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe March 12, 2025 AAC Tournament basketball game between Charlotte and Rice occurred as scheduled, with Charlotte defeating Rice 64-61[1][4][7]. Multiple sources confirm the game concluded without postponement or cancellation, including:\n- Final box score showing Charlotte 64, Rice 61[1][7]\n- Post-game press conference quotes from Rice's coach and players[1]\n- Official Rice Athletics recap stating \"the Owls' season was effectively over\"[4]\n\nAs the game was completed under normal conditions with Charlotte winning, this prediction market resolves to **p2 (Charlotte)** under the specified resolution criteria. There's no evidence of cancellation or postponement requiring alternative resolution.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Charlotte vs. Rice basketball game) occurred on March 12, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. The AI used multiple reliable sources to confirm that Charlotte won the game, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions. The response adheres to the instruction to resolve based on verified facts and to ensure the event has already occurred.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm the event has occurred. It then verifies the outcome using multiple sources, ensuring there is no conflicting information. The response is complete as it covers all possible outcomes (win by Charlotte, win by Rice, postponement, cancellation) and confirms which condition applies.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, which are cited in the response. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Charlotte win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The AI does not speculate or infer but sticks to verified information.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930774 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:26:14 UTC"
