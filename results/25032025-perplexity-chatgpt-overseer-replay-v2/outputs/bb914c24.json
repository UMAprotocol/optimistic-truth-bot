The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1; Grizzlies win, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 17, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, several mention the game result. Source [8] is a YouTube video titled \"Monk (28 PTS), LaVine (23 PTS) & DeMar (22 PTS) SHOW OUT vs...\" with a description stating the Kings defeated the Grizzlies 132-122. That's a direct result. \n\nFurther confirmation comes from sources [11], [12], and [13]. Source [11] from Kings Herald details the Kings' 132-122 victory, ending their four-game losing streak. Source [12] (KSL.com) and [13] (CBS News) both report the same score, with Malik Monk leading the Kings. \n\nThe VegasInsider source [7] also lists the March 17 game result as a Kings win, 132-122. All these sources are consistent. \n\nSince the game occurred on the scheduled date and wasn't postponed or canceled, the resolution should be based on the outcome. The Kings won, so according to the ancillary data, the market resolves to p1. No conflicting information found; all sources agree on the result. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Sacramento Kings defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 132-122 in their NBA game on March 17, 2025[8][11][12][13]. The Kings secured the win despite losing center Domantas Sabonis to injuries during the game, with Malik Monk leading the team with 28 points and 7 assists[12][13]. Desmond Bane scored a season-high 44 points for the Grizzlies in the losing effort[12][13].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Kings 132, Grizzlies 122[8][11][12][13]\n- The game was played as scheduled on March 17, 2025[7][8][11][12][13]\n- No indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[7][8][11][12][13]\n\nBased on the verified outcome and resolution conditions, the market should resolve to \"Kings\" (p1).\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926992 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:23:12 UTC"
