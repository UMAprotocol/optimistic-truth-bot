The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Seattle Kraken vs. Chicago Blackhawks game scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kraken win, the market resolves to \"Kraken\" (p2), and if the Blackhawks win, it resolves to \"Blackhawks\" (p1). If the game is postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 26, 2025. The game was on March 18, so it's already in the past. That means I don't have to worry about postponement or cancellation anymore. The next step is to verify the outcome of the game using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, all sources [1] through [8] consistently report that the Seattle Kraken defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 6-2 on March 18. For example, source [1] states, \"Shane Wright scored twice, Adam Larsson had a goal and two assists, and the Seattle Kraken beat the Chicago Blackhawks 6-2 on Tuesday night.\" Similar confirmations are found in sources [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], and [8]. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution isn't p3. Since the Kraken won decisively, the market should resolve to p2 according to the ancillary data. All sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nThe Seattle Kraken defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 6-2 in their NHL game on March 18, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][3][4][6][7][8]. The Kraken overcame an early 2-0 deficit with six unanswered goals, including two from Shane Wright and contributions from Adam Larsson (1 goal, 2 assists). This outcome occurred on the scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports.  \n\n**Resolution Analysis**  \n- **Game Outcome**: Seattle Kraken victory (6-2)[1][4][6]  \n- **Postponement/Cancellation**: None reported[1-8]  \n\nPer the ancillary data, the market resolves to **\"Kraken\"** (p2) as the Kraken won the game.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Seattle Kraken vs. Chicago Blackhawks game on March 18, 2025) and verifies that it has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. The outcome of the game is confirmed through multiple sources, which is in line with the requirement to use verified facts. The response adheres to the instruction to report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome. It correctly identifies that the game was not postponed or canceled, which aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The resolution recommendation (p2) directly corresponds to the outcome where the Seattle Kraken won the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks for any reports of postponement or cancellation. The alignment of the recommendation with the ancillary data is precise, as the Kraken's victory leads to a resolution of p2.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring reliability and reducing the risk of bias.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742986534 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:55:34 UTC",
