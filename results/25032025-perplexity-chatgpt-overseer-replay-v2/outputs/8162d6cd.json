        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Choi vs. Vallejos fight at UFC Fight Night 254 on March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Vallejos wins, it's p1; if Choi wins, p2; and if there's a draw, postponement, or cancellation, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the fight has already occurred. Next, I need to verify the result using the provided sources. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [3] from Cageside Press states that Kevin Vallejos stopped Seung-Woo Choi in the first round via TKO. Source [4] from MMA Junkie confirms this with a video of the knockout and the official result as a TKO in Round 1. Source [6] also details the fight's round-by-round, ending in a TKO victory for Vallejos. Additionally, source [8] mentions Vallejos's first-round KO win, further corroborating the outcome.\n\nAll credible sources agree that Vallejos won by TKO. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. Since the event date is in the past and multiple reliable sources confirm Vallejos's victory, the market should resolve to p1. The resolution source ESPN isn't directly cited here, but the consensus from MMA Junkie, Cageside Press, and Bloody Elbow serves as credible reporting. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nKevin Vallejos defeated Seung Woo Choi via first-round TKO (punches) at UFC Fight Night 254 on March 15, 2025. The official result was declared at 3:09 of Round 1, with Vallejos dropping Choi with a counter right hand before finishing with ground strikes[3][4][6]. Multiple credible sources including MMA Junkie, Cageside Press, and Bloody Elbow confirmed the outcome through detailed fight recaps and video evidence of the stoppage[3][4][6][8]. The event occurred before the resolution cutoff date, and no indications of postponement or cancellation exist in the verified records.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the fight between Seung Woo Choi and Kevin Vallejos occurred on March 15, 2025, and that Kevin Vallejos won by TKO in the first round. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"p1\" if Vallejos wins. The response does not use ESPN directly as a source but justifies using a consensus of credible reporting, which is allowed by the prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event has occurred. It then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple credible sources, which all agree on Vallejos's victory. This thorough verification from multiple sources ensures the completeness and reliability of the information provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, including MMA Junkie, Cageside Press, and Bloody Elbow. The alignment of the recommendation with the facts is accurate as all sources confirm Vallejos's victory, and the market resolution conditions specified in the user prompt are met.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not mention using ESPN directly, which is specified as the resolution source in the prompt. However, it justifies this by using a consensus of credible reporting, which is acceptable as per the prompt instructions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It accurately and completely addresses the user prompt with adherence to the specified conditions and logical reasoning. The verification of the event through multiple credible sources and the alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple credible sources and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses credible sources to confirm the event outcome and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907516 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:58:36 UTC"
