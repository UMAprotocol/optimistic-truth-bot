The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the UC Riverside vs. Santa Clara basketball game that was scheduled for March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Santa Clara wins, it's p1; UC Riverside, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 18 has already occurred. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game result. Source [1] from Santa Clara's official site states they won 101-62. Source [2] from CBS Sports also reports Santa Clara's victory with the same score. Source [4] from the Big West Conference's site and [7] from UC Riverside's own site both confirm the loss to Santa Clara. Additionally, the box score in [5] shows the final score as 101-62. \n\nAll sources agree that Santa Clara won decisively. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event occurred and Santa Clara won, the resolution should be p1. I need to ensure that all citations are correctly applied to each relevant fact. The answer should clearly state the outcome, cite the sources, and end with the recommendation.\n</think>\n\nSanta Clara defeated UC Riverside 101-62 in their March 18, 2025 NIT first-round game, decisively meeting the market's resolution conditions for a Santa Clara win[1][2][4][5][7]. The Broncos dominated from the start, setting a WCC record with 16 three-pointers and leading by 39 points at the final buzzer[1][2]. Five Santa Clara players scored in double figures, while UC Riverside's season ended with its first-ever NIT appearance[1][7].\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation across multiple verified sources, including both teams' official athletic websites and major sports outlets[1][2][4][5][7]. With Santa Clara's clear victory under the defined resolution parameters:\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908562 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:16:02 UTC"
