        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Danny Ryan will be announced as the next executive director of the Ethereum Foundation by the end of 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he's officially announced as Aya Miyaguchi's successor by December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current leadership status. From the search results, Aya Miyaguchi stepped down as CEO/Executive Director in February 2025 and became the board chair or president. The Ethereum Foundation hasn't named a successor yet, and there's speculation about an external candidate. \n\nDanny Ryan was a key figure in the Ethereum community, involved in major upgrades like The Merge. There was an informal vote where a significant number of ETH holders supported him as the next leader. However, according to sources [5][9][11], Ryan was in talks to rejoin the Ethereum Foundation but instead joined Etherealize in March 2025 as a co-founder. This move indicates he's no longer in the running for the executive director position at the Ethereum Foundation. \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Sta\u0144czak as co-Executive Directors, which is a new structure. Since the resolution condition requires Danny Ryan to be announced as the successor, and the current co-directors are already in place, it's unlikely Ryan will be named by the deadline. \n\nAlso, Vitalik Buterin mentioned that the decision-making power for leadership rests with him, and the restructuring is part of a governance refresh. The sources don't mention any upcoming announcements about Ryan taking the role. Therefore, based on the current information, the answer should resolve to \"No\". \n\nRecommendation: p1 (No) because Danny Ryan has taken a different role, and the Ethereum Foundation has already restructured its leadership without appointing him as the executive director.\n</think>\n\nAs of March 26, 2025, Danny Ryan has not been announced as the successor to Aya Miyaguchi as Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation. The available evidence shows:\n\n1. **Leadership Restructuring**:  \n   The Ethereum Foundation underwent significant leadership changes in early 2025:\n   - Aya Miyaguchi transitioned from Executive Director to President/Board Chair in February 2025 [2][3][6][7].\n   - Two new **co-Executive Directors** were appointed: Hsiao-Wei Wang (EF researcher) and Tomasz Sta\u0144czak (Nethermind founder) [5][9][14]. This dual-leadership structure replaces Miyaguchi\u2019s former role.\n\n2. **Danny Ryan\u2019s New Role**:  \n   Ryan, a former Ethereum Foundation researcher and Merge architect, declined an opportunity to rejoin the EF leadership and instead co-founded **Etherealize** in March 2025, an organization focused on bridging Ethereum with institutional investors [1][4][5][9][11]. His departure from EF-related roles was finalized in January 2025 [9].\n\n3. **Community Sentiment vs. Reality**:  \n   While an informal vote by ETH holders showed 99.98% support for Ryan as EF leader [8][13], this did not translate into an official appointment. Vitalik Buterin clarified that leadership decisions ultimately rest with him until formal governance reforms occur [10][13].\n\nGiven the ancillary data\u2019s resolution conditions, the market would resolve to **\u201cNo\u201d** because:\n- The Ethereum Foundation has already restructured its leadership without naming Ryan as Executive Director.\n- Ryan has publicly committed to Etherealize, making his appointment as EF Executive Director by December 31, 2025, highly improbable.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015484 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 18:58:04 UTC",
