The ancillary data specifies that if the Timberwolves win, it's p2; if the Nuggets win, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, 50-50. \n\nFirst, check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so March 12 is definitely in the past. Next, verify if the game happened and who won. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Source [1] states the Timberwolves won 115-95. Source [5] also mentions Anthony Edwards scoring 29 points leading to a Timberwolves victory. The box score in [7] and play-by-play in [2] back this up. \n\nCheck for any postponement or cancellation. All sources refer to the game happening on March 12, with no mentions of delays or cancellations. Source [4] even discusses player injuries but confirms the game proceeded. \n\nSince the game occurred and the Timberwolves won, the resolution should be p2. No conflicting info found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Denver Nuggets 115-95 in their March 12, 2025 matchup at Ball Arena. Multiple sources confirm the Timberwolves led wire-to-wire, with Anthony Edwards scoring 29 points and Julius Randle adding 25 points[1][5][7]. The game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation mentioned in any reports[6][9].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Timberwolves 115, Nuggets 95[7][9]\n- Spread outcome: Nuggets failed to cover the 2-point spread[1]\n- Game occurred on March 12, 2025 as planned[6][9]\n- No evidence of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1-16]\n\nBased on the ancillary data parameters and verified game outcome, the market should resolve to \"Timberwolves\" (p2). \n\nrecommendation: p2",

It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all confirm that the Timberwolves won the game. This is in line with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for the occurrence of the game, its outcome, and any potential postponements or cancellations. Finding none, it concludes based on the evidence that the Timberwolves won. This reasoning is thorough and aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Timberwolves\" (p2) directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data, where p2 is defined as a Timberwolves win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any unnecessary reliance on irrelevant details or sources, and it strictly adheres to the event specifics outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934451 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:27:31 UTC"
