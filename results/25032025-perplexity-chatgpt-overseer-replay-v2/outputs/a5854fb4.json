        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of an IPL cricket match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) scheduled for March 23, 2025, at 6:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if SRH wins, the market resolves to \"Hyderabad\" (p2), if RR wins, it's \"Rajasthan\" (p1), and if the game isn't completed by March 30, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the actual date and outcome of the match. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the scheduled match date. Looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [5], [8]) report that SRH defeated RR by 44 runs on March 23, 2025. For example, source [3] provides a detailed scorecard showing SRH scored 286/6 and RR 242/6, with Ishan Kishan named Player of the Match for his century. \n\nNext, I need to check if the match was completed by the deadline of March 30. Since the match took place on March 23 and the result is clearly reported, there's no indication of any postponement or cancellation. All sources confirm the match was played and concluded on the scheduled date. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that a completed match before March 30 leads to p2 (Hyderabad) if SRH wins. All evidence points to SRH's victory, so the market should resolve to p2. There's no conflicting information in the sources, and the match was not affected by any delays beyond the deadline. Therefore, the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe IPL 2025 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) scheduled for March 23, 2025, concluded with **SRH winning by 44 runs**[1][3][4][8]. The game was completed on its original date, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the search results. \n\n**Key details**:\n- SRH posted **286/6** in 20 overs, powered by Ishan Kishan\u2019s 106 (47 balls) and Travis Head\u2019s 67 (31 balls)[3][4].\n- RR managed **242/6** in their chase, with Dhruv Jurel (70 off 35) and Sanju Samson (66 off 37) top-scoring[3][8].\n- The match result was confirmed by multiple sources, including official IPL platforms and news outlets[1][3][5][8].\n\nSince the match was completed before the March 30, 2025, deadline and SRH emerged victorious, the market resolves to **Hyderabad (p2)** as per the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926371 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:12:51 UTC"
