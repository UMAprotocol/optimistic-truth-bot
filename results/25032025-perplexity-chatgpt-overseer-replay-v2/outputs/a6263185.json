The event was on March 15, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 25, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event happened and determine the winner. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the fight took place. Source [1] mentions the official result: Da'Mon Blackshear defeats Cody Gibson via Submission (Kimura) in Round 2. Source [2] also states Blackshear won by kimura submission. Source [5] and [6] both report the same outcome. Even the detailed play-by-play in [6] describes how Blackshear secured the kimura for the tap. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Blackshear wins, the market resolves to p2. Since all credible sources confirm his victory, there's no ambiguity. The event wasn't postponed or canceled, and the result is clear. No conflicting information exists in the sources. Therefore, the resolution should be p2.\n</think>\n\nDa'Mon Blackshear defeated Cody Gibson via submission (kimura) at 4:09 of Round 2 during their UFC Fight Night: Vettori vs. Dolidze 2 bout on March 15, 2025. Multiple credible sources, including official UFC results and MMA news outlets, confirm Blackshear secured the victory through a kimura submission after reversing positions from Gibson's takedown attempts[1][2][5][6][7]. The fight occurred as scheduled, and no postponement or cancellation was reported. Based on the ancillary data's resolution conditions, the market resolves to **p2** (Blackshear).\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928595 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:49:55 UTC"
