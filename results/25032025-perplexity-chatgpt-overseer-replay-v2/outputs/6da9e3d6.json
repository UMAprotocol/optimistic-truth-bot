        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Pelicans vs. Timberwolves game on March 19, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Pelicans win, it's p2; if the Timberwolves win, p1. If postponed, it stays open, and if canceled, it's 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the actual result of the game. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened. Let's check the search results. \n\nLooking at result [2], ESPN's recap clearly states the Pelicans won 119-115. The box score there shows the final score. Result [1] is a YouTube video transcript mentioning the Timberwolves had 110 points and Pelicans 105, but that might be a different game or a mistake. Wait, no, looking closer, result [2] is from ESPN and is more reliable. Also, result [11] is a video titled \"Pelicans 119, Timberwolves 115\" which matches the ESPN recap. \n\nThere's a possible conflict with result [1] where the transcript says Timberwolves 110 and Pelicans 105. But checking the date, result [1] is from March 22, 2025, discussing the March 19 game. However, the ESPN article (result [2]) and the Sportsnet highlight (result [12]) both confirm the Pelicans' 119-115 victory. The discrepancy in result [1] might be an error in the transcript or a different game reference. Since multiple credible sources (ESPN, Sportsnet) agree on the Pelicans' win, I should rely on those.\n\nAdditionally, result [10] is a post-game analysis mentioning the Pelicans' upset win with Zion Williamson's 29 points. Result [4] and [11] are video highlights also confirming the Pelicans' victory. \n\nThe user's ancillary data says a Pelicans win resolves to p2. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2. The conflicting transcript in result [1] might be a mistake, but the majority of sources, especially official ones like ESPN, support the Pelicans' win. So the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 119-115 in their March 19, 2025 NBA matchup at Target Center[2][12]. Zion Williamson led the Pelicans with 29 points and 8 assists, while Anthony Edwards scored 29 points for Minnesota[2][10]. The game remained competitive throughout, with New Orleans overcoming a 43-32 second-quarter deficit through a 14-0 run[2].\n\nKey factors in the Pelicans' victory included:\n- Six different New Orleans players scoring in double figures\n- 45% three-point shooting (13/29) compared to Minnesota's 40%[2]\n- A crucial late-game sequence where Williamson converted a layup with 13.1 seconds remaining to seal the win[2]\n\nThis outcome occurred despite Minnesota being favored with an 84% win probability pre-game[9]. The result dropped the Timberwolves to 40-31 while giving New Orleans its 19th win of the season[10].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923943 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:32:23 UTC"
