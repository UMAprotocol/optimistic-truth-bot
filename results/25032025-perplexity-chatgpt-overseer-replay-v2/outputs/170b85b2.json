        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Go ahead\" three or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are based on whether she uses that exact phrase, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The deadline is December 31, 2025, and if she's no longer Press Secretary by then, it's \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after the current date, March 25, 2025. The search results include transcripts up to March 17, 2025, and some from February and January. The latest transcript is from March 17, 2025 (source 15), and there's a mention of a briefing on March 17 where she answered questions but didn't use \"Go ahead\" three times. \n\nLooking at the transcripts, in source 1 (January 31, 2025), she uses \"Go ahead\" once when addressing Steven Nelson. In source 7 (January 29, 2025), she says \"Go ahead\" once to Matt. Source 16 (February 25, 2025) shows her using \"Go ahead\" once when responding to a reporter named James. However, none of these instances reach three times in a single briefing.\n\nThe user's query is about the next briefing after March 25, 2025. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the latest available transcript is March 17, there's no information on briefings after that date. The next briefing hasn't occurred yet, so we can't verify if she will use the phrase three times. \n\nAdditionally, the market specifies that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer Press Secretary, it resolves to \"No\". There's no indication in the search results that she has left her position, so that condition doesn't apply yet. However, since the next briefing is in the future relative to the current date, and we don't have transcripts for it, we can't confirm the outcome. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information up to March 17, 2025, and the lack of data on future briefings, the resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved now) because the event is scheduled for a future date. However, the user's instructions say that if the event is in the future, return p4. But the market's resolution conditions state that if the event hasn't happened by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". But since the user is asking about the next briefing, which is after March 25, and we don't have information on it, the correct recommendation is p4 as the event is in the future and hasn't occurred yet.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question (Karoline Leavitt saying \"Go ahead\" three or more times during her next White House press briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by checking for the occurrence of the event and finding that it has not yet occurred, thus recommending p4 (cannot be resolved now) as the event is scheduled for a future date.\n\nHowever, the critical rule for the UMA optimistic oracle system states that if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a RETRY must always be chosen. This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues to resolve the query are exhausted before defaulting to p4. The response could potentially be improved by exploring additional sources or methods to predict or infer the likelihood of the event occurring before the specified deadline, although it must be noted that the AI's primary function is to analyze events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.\n\nGiven these considerations, the response is logically sound and aligns with the instructions provided.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Go ahead\" three or more times during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and \"p3\" if uncertain. The deadline is December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing before the deadline. The current date is March 25, 2025. The search results mention several briefings in January, February, and March 2025. The latest mentioned is March 17, 2025 (source 8), and March 23, 2025 (source 10). There's also a mention of a briefing on March 5, 2025 (source 14). However, there's no information about a future briefing after March 25. \n\nNext, I need to verify if Leavitt is still the Press Secretary. The sources indicate she's active as of March 2025. There's no mention of her leaving the position, so she's likely still in the role. \n\nLooking at past behavior, in the provided transcripts, Leavitt frequently uses \"Go ahead\" when calling on reporters. For example, in the March 17 briefing (source 8), she says \"Go ahead\" multiple times. Similarly, in the February 12 briefing (source 13), she uses it repeatedly. This pattern suggests she uses the phrase often during briefings. \n\nHowever, the next briefing hasn't happened yet. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and there's no info on upcoming briefings, the event is in the future. According to the rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, we must return p4. But wait, the user's query allows until December 31, 2025. But the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by then, it resolves to \"No\". \n\nBut the user is asking about the next briefing. Since the next briefing hasn't occurred yet and there's no confirmed schedule, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, if the event hasn't happened yet, we should resolve to p4. However, the ancillary data says if no briefing happens by the deadline, it's \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing whenever it occurs. Since we can't confirm if the next briefing is before the deadline, but the deadline is months away, it's possible a briefing could happen. However, without specific info on the next briefing date, we can't confirm. \n\nWait, the user's query specifies \"next White House press briefing she participates in\". If there's no next briefing before the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". But since the deadline is December 31, 2025, and today is March 25, there's time. However, the market resolution depends on whether the next briefing happens before the deadline. Since we don't have info on future briefings, but Leavitt is active, it's possible. However, the user's question is about whether she will say \"Go ahead\" 3+ times in the next briefing whenever it occurs. Since the next briefing is in the future, and we can't predict her exact words, the answer should be p4. But the system wants us to try to find evidence. \n\nLooking at past behavior, she uses \"Go ahead\" frequently. For example, in source 8 (March 17), she uses it at least 4 times. In source 13 (February 12), multiple instances. So historically, she does use the phrase often. If the next briefing follows the same pattern, it's likely. But since the event is in the future, the strict rule says p4. However, the user's personalization says to check if the event is in the future. Since the next briefing hasn't happened yet, even if likely, we must default to p4. But the ancillary data allows for resolving based on the most probable outcome if the event date is past. Wait, the event date is the next briefing, which is in the future. Therefore, per the rules, since the event is scheduled for a future date, resolve to p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. So despite historical patterns, the answer must be p4.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt will say \"Go ahead\" three or more times during her next press briefing. Based on the provided sources and current timestamp of March 25, 2025, the next press briefing has not yet occurred. Historical transcripts show Leavitt frequently uses the phrase \"Go ahead\" to call on reporters (e.g., 4+ instances in the March 17 briefing[8], repeated usage in February briefings[7][13]). However, since the event is scheduled for a future date and no definitive information about the next briefing\u2019s timing or content exists, the resolution cannot be confirmed at this time.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Karoline Leavitt saying \"Go ahead\" three or more times during her next White House press briefing) is scheduled for a future date. It adheres to the system prompt instructions by checking for the occurrence of the event and noting that since the event is in the future, it cannot be resolved at this time. The response also correctly identifies that if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, the market should resolve to \"No\".\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by analyzing past behavior of Karoline Leavitt in press briefings and noting her frequent use of the phrase \"Go ahead\". This historical pattern is used to discuss the likelihood of her using the phrase in future briefings. However, the response could improve by more explicitly stating that despite the historical frequency of the phrase, it cannot predict future occurrences, thus adhering strictly to the oracle's role of not predicting future events.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly concludes that since the next briefing is not scheduled or confirmed before the current date, and the event is in the future, it must recommend p4. This aligns with the system prompt's requirement to only resolve based on events that have already occurred or have definitive information.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors. It remains neutral and factual throughout. However, it could improve by providing a clearer explanation of why, despite the historical data suggesting a high likelihood of the phrase being used, it cannot definitively resolve the market to p1 or p2 due to the lack of information about the next briefing.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response adheres to the instructions by recommending p4 due to the future scheduling of the event, and considering the system's rule that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always be retried, the following decision is made:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the system prompt instructions by identifying the event as scheduled for a future date and correctly recommends p4, as no definitive information about the next briefing\u2019s timing or content exists.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is logically sound and adheres to the guidelines. It could improve by more explicitly stating the inability to predict future events despite historical patterns.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThis decision reflects that the response has met the necessary criteria for accuracy and adherence to the system's rules, and no further attempts are required.",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925168 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:52:48 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease verify if there are any additional sources or upcoming schedules for White House press briefings that could provide more information about the likelihood of the event occurring before the deadline.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response accurately followed the instructions and logically concluded that the event is in the future and thus unresolved.
