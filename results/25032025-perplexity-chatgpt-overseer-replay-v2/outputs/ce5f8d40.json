        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the SC State vs. Norfolk State basketball game that was scheduled for March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if SC State wins, it resolves to p2; if Norfolk State wins, p1; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 15, so the game should have happened. Let me look through the search results to confirm the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([1], [3], [6], [9], [12]) mention the game's result. Source [1] states that Norfolk State won 66-65. Source [3] also confirms the same score, with Christian Ings making the go-ahead free throw. Source [6] details the comeback by Norfolk State and their victory. Source [9] describes the final moments where SC State's mistake led to Norfolk's win. The ESPN game summary in [12] lists the final score as 66-65 in favor of Norfolk State. \n\nAll these sources consistently report Norfolk State as the winner. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that a Norfolk State win corresponds to p1. Since the event occurred and the outcome is clear, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nNorfolk State defeated South Carolina State 66-65 in the MEAC Tournament Final on March 15, 2025, securing the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament[1][3][6][12]. The game featured a dramatic comeback by Norfolk State after trailing by 11 points in the second half, with Christian Ings making the decisive free throw with eight seconds remaining[3][6]. South Carolina State's late-game rally, led by Wilson Dubinsky's 24-point performance (including 5/5 three-pointers), fell short due to a critical foul in the final seconds[9][12]. The outcome aligns with the resolution conditions specifying a Norfolk State victory as **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923264 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:21:04 UTC"
