The user is asking whether Ukraine will take responsibility for the cyberattack on X (formerly Twitter) by March 14, 2025, based on the provided resolution conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The deadline for the market resolution was March 14, so the event date is in the past. According to the rules, if the event date has passed and there's no verifiable information, I should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions unless contradicted by sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources indicate that Elon Musk claimed the cyberattack originated from Ukrainian IP addresses. However, Ukrainian officials, including the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, denied any involvement (sources 16 and 12). The hacker group Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility, and cybersecurity experts expressed skepticism about Musk's claims, pointing out that IP addresses can be spoofed (sources 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 14). \n\nThe resolution condition requires an official Ukrainian government statement claiming responsibility. None of the sources show Ukraine taking responsibility; instead, they consistently deny it. Since the deadline has passed and no official claim was made, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in question is the same as described. All sources refer to the March 10 cyberattack on X, which aligns with the user's query. There's no mention of Ukraine changing their stance or any official claiming responsibility by March 14. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe cyberattack on X (formerly Twitter) occurred on March 10, 2025, with Elon Musk claiming IP addresses \"originating in the Ukraine area\" were involved[1][2][3][5][6][11]. However, **no official Ukrainian government representative claimed responsibility by the March 14 deadline**, and multiple sources confirm:\n\n1. **Ukrainian officials explicitly denied involvement**, calling the accusations baseless and counterproductive to their cybersecurity priorities[12][16][17]. The chair of Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee stated the government had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with the attack\u201d[16].\n\n2. **Pro-Palestinian hacker group Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility** for the DDoS attack[3][6][9][14], with cybersecurity experts noting IP addresses alone are unreliable for attribution due to spoofing[2][7][9][14].\n\n3. **Analysts and former cybersecurity leaders criticized Musk\u2019s claims** as lacking evidence, with the UK\u2019s ex-NCSC head calling them \u201cgarbage\u201d[10][15].\n\nGiven the resolution conditions (p2 = Yes if Ukraine claims responsibility via official channels by March 14), the absence of any verified Ukrainian government admission meets the criteria for resolution to **No** (p1). \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the current date as March 25, 2025, and acknowledges that the event in question (Ukraine's potential responsibility for a cyberattack) was supposed to be resolved by March 14, 2025. The AI then correctly concludes that since the event date is in the past, it must check for verifiable information to resolve the market. The response uses multiple sources to confirm that no official Ukrainian government representative claimed responsibility for the attack, which aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with the verification of the current date, followed by a search for relevant information about the event. It then assesses the information against the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt. The AI's reasoning is thorough, considering claims and denials from various sources, including statements from Ukrainian officials and other entities claiming responsibility.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verifies that the cyberattack occurred on March 10, 2025, and that the claims about Ukrainian responsibility were not substantiated by the deadline of March 14, 2025. The response aligns perfectly with the facts as it recommends resolving the market to \"No\" (p1), based on the absence of an official Ukrainian government admission of responsibility.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The AI has used a balanced approach by considering all relevant sources and statements related to the event.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) is based on solid evidence and aligns with the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, using verifiable information to make a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the absence of an official Ukrainian statement claiming responsibility for the cyberattack, aligning well with the resolution conditions and providing a clear and justified recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931005 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:30:05 UTC"
