The event date is March 23, 2025, at 7:45 PM ET. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 23, 2025. Sources [1], [5], and [6] confirm the game was played, with Ole Miss winning 91-78. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome. Multiple sources report Ole Miss as the winner. For example, source [1] states, \"No. 3 seed Iowa State\u2019s season comes to an end at the hot hands of No. 6 seed Ole Miss by a score of 91-78.\" Source [5] also confirms the final score and Ole Miss's victory. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Ole Miss wins, the resolution is p2. Since the game wasn't postponed or canceled, and the outcome is clear, the correct resolution is p2. No conflicting information is present in the sources, so there's no need to consider p3 or p4. \n\nI should ensure that all citations are correctly applied. The key sources are [1], [5], and [6], which all corroborate the result. The answer should clearly state the outcome and the corresponding resolution recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament game between No. 6 seed Ole Miss and No. 3 seed Iowa State occurred as scheduled on March 23, 2025, at 7:45 PM ET in Milwaukee. Ole Miss defeated Iowa State 91-78[1][5][6], advancing to the Sweet 16 while ending Iowa State's season. The Rebels' historic shooting performance (58.2% FG, 57.9% 3PT) proved decisive despite Iowa State's second-half offensive improvements[1][5].\n\n**Key Game Details**  \n- **Final Score**: Ole Miss 91, Iowa State 78[1][5]  \n- **Ole Miss Leaders**: Sean Pedulla (20 points, 8 assists), Malik Dia (12.9 ppg average last 10 games)[2][5]  \n- **Iowa State Leaders**: Curtis Jones (26 points), Joshua Jefferson (16 points)[5]  \n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, meeting all specified resolution conditions. Based on the verified outcome and ancillary data parameters, the market resolves to **Ole Miss**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

This outcome is supported by multiple sources, which are appropriately cited. The response adheres to the instruction to report only on verified facts and to ensure the event has already occurred before making a resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources to conclude that Ole Miss won. It correctly applies the resolution condition (p2 for an Ole Miss win) as specified in the ancillary data. The reasoning is clear, direct, and well-supported by evidence.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through reliable sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts established and the conditions outlined in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the relevant event and does not include unnecessary or unrelated information, maintaining a high level of precision and relevance.\n\nGiven the accurate and complete nature of the response, and its strict adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns perfectly with the ancillary data, and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses verified sources effectively, and provides a clear and accurate resolution recommendation based on the event's outcome.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
