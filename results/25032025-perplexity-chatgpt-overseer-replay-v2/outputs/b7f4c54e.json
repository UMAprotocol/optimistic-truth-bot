The ancillary data specifies that if Houston wins, it's p1; if Arizona wins, p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 15, so it's in the past. That means the event has already occurred, so no need to consider postponement or cancellation unless there's info suggesting otherwise.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Source [1] mentions the final score as Houston 72, Arizona 64. Source [2] also lists the final score with Houston winning 72-64. Source [3] is an article from Arizona's official site stating they fell 72-64 in the Big 12 Championship. Source [4] from Fox Sports corroborates the same score. Additionally, source [8] from Houston's official site celebrates their Big 12 Championship win, again confirming the score.\n\nAll these sources are consistent: Houston won the game. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that a Houston win resolves to p1. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Arizona vs. Houston men's basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET concluded with **Houston defeating Arizona 72-64** in the Big 12 Tournament championship game[1][2][3][4]. Key details:  \n\n- **Final Score**: Houston 72, Arizona 64[1][2][3][4]  \n- **Key Performers**:  \n  - Houston\u2019s Milos Uzan led all scorers with 25 points[2][4].  \n  - Arizona\u2019s Caleb Love scored 19 points but shot 7-19 from the field[1][3].  \n- **Game Context**: Houston overcame a 33-28 halftime deficit with a 44-31 second-half surge, clinching the Big 12 title[3][8].  \n\nNo evidence indicates the game was postponed or canceled.

The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and aligns the recommendation with the facts provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Arizona vs. Houston CBB game) occurred on March 15, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is Houston's victory over Arizona with a score of 72-64. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition that a Houston win should resolve to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple reliable sources. It correctly concludes that there is no evidence of postponement or cancellation, which matches the conditions set in the user prompt for resolving the market.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through credible sources, including official sites and reputable sports news outlets. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Houston win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response adequately covers all necessary aspects to make an informed resolution recommendation.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, and logical consistency in the reasoning, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources, aligns with the resolution conditions, and logically processes the information without any errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event outcome and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
