        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Grand Canyon vs. Maryland basketball game that was scheduled for March 21, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Maryland wins, it's p1; Grand Canyon, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 21. So the game should have happened. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [5], [6], [7], [9], [12], [17]) report the game's result. \n\nFrom the search results, it's clear that Maryland won the game. For example, source [1] states the final score was Maryland 81, GCU 49. Source [5] from ESPN confirms the same score, and source [6] mentions Maryland's 81-49 victory. All these sources are consistent in reporting Maryland's win. \n\nI also need to check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. None of the search results indicate that the game was postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place on March 21 with a clear result. \n\nSince the event occurred and Maryland won decisively, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. There's no ambiguity here. The sources are reliable, including official sports websites and university pages, which adds credibility to the result. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nMaryland defeated Grand Canyon 81-49 in their NCAA tournament first-round game on March 21, 2025. The fourth-seeded Terrapins dominated with a 42-28 halftime lead and extended their advantage to 32 points in the second half. Key performances came from Julian Reese (18 points, 9 rebounds) and Derik Queen (12 points, 15 rebounds), while Grand Canyon's Tyon Grant-Foster scored 23 points in a losing effort[1][5][6]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, meeting all specified resolution conditions.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the game, which Maryland won with a score of 81-49. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where Maryland's win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks if the event has occurred and verifies the outcome using reliable sources. It also checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled, which there were none. This thorough verification ensures that the resolution recommendation is based on complete information.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the information's reliability and accuracy. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Maryland win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925787 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:03:07 UTC"
