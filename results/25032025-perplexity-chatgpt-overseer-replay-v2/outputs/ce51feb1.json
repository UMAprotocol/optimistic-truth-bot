The ancillary data specifies that if the Penguins win, it's p1; if the Blues win, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, and the game was on March 13, so it's already happened. No need to worry about postponement or cancellation. \n\nNext, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [1] is an article titled \"Rakell, Rust each gets 2 points, Penguins defeat Blues for 3rd...\" which clearly states the Penguins won 5-3. The date matches March 13, 2025. \n\nResult [3] is a video titled \"Game Highlights: Blues 3, Penguins 5\" confirming the same score. \n\nResult [8] from thescore.com also reports the Penguins' 5-3 victory, mentioning key players and goals. \n\nMultiple other sources like [9], [10], [11], and [14] all corroborate the Penguins' win with the 5-3 scoreline. \n\nThere's no conflicting information in the search results. All sources agree the Penguins won. The ancillary data says a Penguins win corresponds to p1. \n\nSince the event occurred and the outcome is verified, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the St. Louis Blues and Pittsburgh Penguins on March 13, 2025, concluded with a **5-3 victory for the Pittsburgh Penguins**[1][3][8][9][10][11][14]. Key highlights include:\n\n- **Penguins' offensive performance**: Rickard Rakell (1 goal, 1 assist) and Bryan Rust (1 goal, 1 assist) led the scoring, with additional goals from Ryan Graves, Conor Timmins, and Connor Dewar[1][8][11].  \n- **Blues' efforts**: Zack Bolduc, Dylan Holloway, and Alexey Toropchenko scored for St. Louis, with two power-play goals[1][3][10].  \n- **Goalie impact**: Tristan Jarry made 33 saves for Pittsburgh, while Jordan Binnington was pulled in the third period after allowing four goals[1][8][11].  \n\nThe outcome meets the resolution criteria specified in the ancillary data, as the Penguins secured a regulation win.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between the Blues and Penguins on March 13, 2025) has already occurred as of the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It adheres to the instruction to resolve based on past events and uses multiple sources to verify the outcome, which is that the Pittsburgh Penguins won the game 5-3.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the steps required by the system prompt. It checks the event date, confirms it is in the past, and then proceeds to verify the outcome using reliable sources. The response is thorough in detailing the game's key highlights and players' performances, which supports the credibility of the outcome reported.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation of `p1` aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided, where `p1` corresponds to a Penguins win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on verified facts and aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932973 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:02:53 UTC"
