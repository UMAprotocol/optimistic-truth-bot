The ancillary data specifies that if Tennessee wins, it's p2; if Auburn wins, p1; postponed stays open, canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so March 15 is definitely in the past. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are two key games mentioned. The first is on January 25, 2025, where Auburn won 53-51 [1][3][5]. The second is the March 15 game, which is the one in question. \n\nSearch results [2][4][6][7][8] all reference the March 15 game. Specifically, result [2] states that Tennessee defeated Auburn 70-65 in the SEC Tournament semifinal. Result [4] from the University of Tennessee's site confirms the same score, and [8] from CBS Sports also reports Tennessee's 70-65 victory. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and not postponed or canceled, the resolution depends on the winner. All sources agree Tennessee won, so the market should resolve to p2. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all relevant sources align. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe March 15, 2025, men's college basketball game between Tennessee and Auburn was played as scheduled at 1:00 PM ET in the SEC Tournament semifinals. **Tennessee defeated Auburn 70-65** in a closely contested matchup[2][4][8]. Key details:  \n\n- **Tennessee's Zakai Zeigler** led all scorers with 20 points, while **Auburn's Johni Broome** (SEC Player of the Year) had 23 points and 15 rebounds[2][8].  \n- The Volunteers overcame a 33-32 halftime deficit and sealed the win with defensive stops in the final minutes[4].  \n- This result avenged Tennessee\u2019s 53-51 loss to Auburn in their January 25 regular-season meeting[6].  \n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is definitively verified through multiple authoritative sources.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Tennessee vs. Auburn game occurred on March 15, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. It correctly states that Tennessee won the game with a score of 70-65. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution, where a Tennessee win should resolve to \"p2\".\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm it is in the past and then proceeds to verify the outcome through multiple sources. It provides a detailed account of the game, including scores and key players, which supports the resolution decision comprehensively.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple authoritative sources, ensuring the information is reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"p2\" (Tennessee win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The information provided is relevant and directly pertains to the query. All necessary details to make an informed resolution are included, and there is no missing information that could affect the decision.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
