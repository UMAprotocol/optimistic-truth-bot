        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know whether Fenerbahce or Rangers advanced in the UEFA Europa League matchup based on the provided ancillary data. The resolution conditions state that p1 is Rangers, p2 is Fenerbahce, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The match in question took place on March 13 and 14, 2025, according to the search results. Since the event date is in the past, there's no issue with it being postponed or canceled. So p3 is out of the question.\n\nNext, looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [4], [5], [6], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14]) confirm that Rangers advanced to the quarterfinals after a penalty shootout. The aggregate score was 3-3, and Rangers won 3-2 on penalties. Fenerbahce won the second leg 2-0 but couldn't secure advancement due to the shootout loss. \n\nJose Mourinho's comments in [5] and [13] express frustration but acknowledge the outcome. The key detail is the penalty result, which is consistently reported across sources. Since the resolution depends on who advances, and all sources agree Rangers did, the correct resolution is p1 (Rangers). There's no conflicting information, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nRangers advanced to the UEFA Europa League quarterfinals after defeating Fenerbahce 3-2 in a penalty shootout following a 3-3 aggregate draw across both legs[1][4][5][6][9][10][12][13][14]. The second leg on March 13, 2025, saw Fenerbahce win 2-0 in regular time with goals from Sebastian Szymanski (45' and 73'), leveling the aggregate score after Rangers' 3-1 first-leg victory[1][4][7][9]. Despite Fenerbahce's comeback, Rangers goalkeeper Jack Butland saved two penalties in the shootout, securing their progression[1][5][6][10][14].\n\n**Key details:**\n- **First leg (March 6):** Rangers won 3-1 in Istanbul with goals from Cyriel Dessers and V\u00e1clav \u010cern\u00fd[2][3].\n- **Second leg (March 13):** Fenerbahce won 2-0 but fell short in penalties[1][4][7].\n- **Penalty shootout:** Butland saved efforts from Du\u0161an Tadi\u0107 and Fred, while Mert Hakan Yanda\u015f missed the decisive penalty[1][6][10][14].\n\nThe match concluded without postponement or cancellation, and UEFA's official outcome confirms Rangers' advancement[1][4][5][12]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930498 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:21:38 UTC"
