The ancillary data specifies that if the Bucks win, it's p2 (Bucks), Kings win p1 (Kings), postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, check the date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 22 is in the past. That means the event has already occurred. Now, need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [1][2][3][4][8] report that the Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Sacramento Kings 114-108 on March 22. For example, source [1] states the Bucks won 114-108, with Giannis scoring 32 points. Source [2] and [3] confirm the same score and outcome. Additionally, source [8] mentions the Kings' loss and the NBA's report on officiating mistakes, which further confirms the game's result. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution should be based on the actual outcome. Since the Bucks won, the market resolves to p2. \n\nNeed to ensure that the ancillary data's resolution conditions are correctly applied. The user specified p2 for Bucks, which aligns with the game's result. No conflicting information in the sources, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Sacramento Kings 114-108 in their NBA game on March 22, 2025. Multiple sources confirm Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 32 points and 17 rebounds, while Sacramento's late-game collapse included three consecutive airballs and missed free throws in the final minute[1][2][3][4]. The NBA's Last Two Minute Report acknowledged officiating errors in the closing seconds, though these didn't affect the final outcome[8]. \n\n**Resolution Analysis**  \n- **Event Date**: March 22, 2025 (past date relative to current timestamp)  \n- **Outcome**: Bucks victory confirmed across all verified reports  \n- **Postponement/Cancellation**: No evidence of either occurring  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all confirm that the Milwaukee Bucks won against the Sacramento Kings with a score of 114-108. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Bucks win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and then proceeds to verify the outcome through reliable sources. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (p2 for a Bucks win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation of p2 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions set out in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
