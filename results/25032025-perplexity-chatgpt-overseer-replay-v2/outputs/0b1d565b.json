        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during the March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on whether he used those exact terms, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The sources provided include transcripts and news articles from around that time.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for mentions of \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" in the March 19 event. The search results include several entries from March 19 and after. Let's look at the relevant ones.\n\nResult [10] from March 19 mentions the FOMC meeting and Powell's press conference. It states that Bitcoin price rose after the Fed maintained rates and projected two cuts in 2025. However, the article doesn't specify if Powell used the words \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during the presser.\n\nResult [11] is similar to [10], discussing the same event but again not quoting Powell using the specific terms. Result [14] from March 20 mentions Bitcoin's price surge post-FOMC but doesn't provide direct quotes from Powell's speech. \n\nResult [15] from March 19 also discusses the FOMC decision's impact on crypto markets but doesn't cite Powell's exact words. Result [17] from Kiplinger, dated March 19, includes a section where Powell is asked about Bitcoin. The article quotes Powell discussing the Fed's role regarding banks and crypto customers, but the exact terms used are crucial. According to the article, Powell said, \"it's fine for banks to serve crypto customers,\" which includes the word \"crypto.\" Additionally, he mentions \"cryptocurrency regulation,\" which the update in the ancillary data specifies that \"Cryptocurrency\" counts as \"crypto.\" \n\nResult [17] explicitly states that when asked about Bitcoin, Powell addressed the Fed's role in evaluating banks serving crypto customers. The exact quote includes \"crypto,\" and the update allows \"Cryptocurrency\" to count as \"crypto.\" Therefore, Powell did use the term \"crypto\" during the press conference. \n\nChecking other sources, results [1], [3], and [4] are from January 2025, which is before the March event, so they're not relevant here. Results [10], [11], [14], [15], and [17] are from March 19 or later. Since [17] directly quotes Powell using \"crypto,\" the answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). There's no mention of \"Bitcoin\" in the March 19 press conference based on the provided sources, but \"crypto\" was used, which meets the resolution condition.\n</think>\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference on March 19, 2025, included a discussion about cryptocurrency regulation. During the Q&A session, Chair Jerome Powell explicitly used the term \"crypto\" when addressing banks' role in serving cryptocurrency customers[17]. This meets the resolution criteria as the ancillary data specifies that mentions of \"cryptocurrency\" count toward the \"crypto\" keyword[17].\n\nWhile Powell didn't use the term \"Bitcoin\" during this specific press conference, his reference to \"crypto\" satisfies the market's resolution conditions for the \"Yes\" outcome (p2). The Fed chair emphasized that banks could legally serve crypto clients with proper risk management, aligning with his earlier January 2025 statements about crypto banking practices[1][3][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929583 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:06:23 UTC",
