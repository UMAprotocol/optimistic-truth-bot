        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the Boston Celtics will make the NBA Playoffs for the 2024-25 season. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if they make the playoffs, \"No\" (p1) otherwise, and reaching the Play-In doesn't count. The resolution source is the NBA's official info.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current standings and whether the Celtics have clinched a playoff spot. The search results mention the Celtics clinching a playoff berth. Let me look through the sources.\n\nSource [1] says the Celtics clinched a spot with a win over the Heat on March 25, 2025. It lists them as 2nd in the East with a 48-19 record. Source [2] from ESPN on March 24 confirms the Celtics have made the playoffs 11 straight times. Source [4] (StatMuse) states they've clinched a playoff berth with a 50-19 record. Source [7] (FOX Sports) also shows the Celtics as the 2nd seed with 50-19. Source [8] (Wikipedia) as of March 24 lists the Celtics at 53-19 and clinched a playoff spot on March 14.\n\nAll these sources consistently confirm the Celtics have already secured a playoff position, not just the Play-In. The ancillary data requires a top 6 finish in the conference, which they've achieved. Since they've mathematically clinched, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2). No conflicting info found. The event date is in the past (current date March 25), so no future uncertainty. Resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Celtics have officially clinched a spot in the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs. Multiple sources confirm their postseason qualification, with the team securing at least the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference as of March 25, 2025[1][2][4][7][8]. The Celtics achieved this by maintaining a 48-19 to 53-19 record (depending on the source\u2019s timestamp), well above the threshold required to avoid the play-in tournament[1][8]. \n\nThe NBA\u2019s playoff structure requires teams to finish in the top six of their conference to automatically qualify, which Boston has accomplished[1][2]. Their 11th consecutive playoff appearance extends the league\u2019s longest active streak[2][8]. Since the Celtics are mathematically locked into a top-six position and cannot be eliminated, this market resolves definitively to \"Yes.\"\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908916 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:21:56 UTC"
