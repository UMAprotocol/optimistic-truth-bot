        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the FDP won 5% or more of the party list votes in the German federal election held on February 23, 2025. The resolution depends on the official results from the Bundeswahlleiter. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the FDP's performance. Looking at result [1], it mentions the FDP got 4.3%, which is below the 5% threshold. Result [5] also states the FDP received 4.3% and failed to enter parliament. Result [9] confirms the FDP at 4.3%, and result [12] from the Bundeswahlleiter's official site lists the FDP at 4.3% of the Zweitstimmen. \n\nSince the official source (Bundeswahlleiter) is cited in multiple results, especially [12], and all agree the FDP is below 5%, the answer should be \"No\". The ancillary data specifies p2 for Yes and p1 for No. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Free Democratic Party (FDP) received **4.3% of the party list votes** in the February 23, 2025 German federal election, according to the official results published by the Federal Returning Officer (Bundeswahlleiterin)[12]. This falls below the 5% threshold required for parliamentary representation, marking the party's second failure to enter the Bundestag since 2013[1][5][9].\n\nKey details from the election:\n- The FDP lost over 7 percentage points compared to its 2021 result of 11.4%[12], with significant voter migration to the CDU/CSU[5].\n- Despite efforts to position itself as a pro-business party advocating tax cuts and bureaucracy reduction[8], the FDP faced backlash from its role in collapsing the previous coalition government[6][14].\n- The party's failure to meet the 5% threshold was confirmed across multiple sources, including provisional results from all 299 electoral districts[12][15].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively uses the official results from the Bundeswahlleiter, which is the specified primary resolution source, to determine that the FDP received 4.3% of the votes, which is below the 5% threshold required for the market to resolve to \"Yes.\"\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it directly correlates the factual information from the official source with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt. The response correctly identifies that the FDP did not meet the 5% threshold and therefore the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1), as specified in the ancillary data.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response cross-references multiple sources, including the official Bundeswahlleiter website, to confirm the FDP's vote percentage and ensures that the information is consistent across different reports.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response provides a detailed account of the FDP's performance and contextual factors that might have influenced the election results, which enhances the completeness of the analysis.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, using the correct primary source as specified, and logically derives the correct resolution based on the provided facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the specified primary source, cross-references additional sources for confirmation, and provides a detailed analysis that aligns with the resolution conditions.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928513 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:48:33 UTC",
