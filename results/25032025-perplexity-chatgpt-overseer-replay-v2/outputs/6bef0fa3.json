        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Laptop\" during his DOJ appearance on March 14, 2025. The resolution conditions are straightforward: \"Yes\" if he used the term, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump's speech at the DOJ on that date. Looking through the sources, several mention the event. Source [6] is a transcript of Trump's speech at the DOJ. In that transcript, he says, \"My administration stripped the security clearances of the disgraced intelligence agents who lied about Hunter Biden's laptop from hell.\" Here, he uses the exact word \"laptop.\" \n\nAnother source, [9], is a video transcript of his remarks where he states, \"My Administration stripped the security clearances of the disgraced intelligence agents who lied about Hunter Biden's laptop from hell.\" Again, \"laptop\" is mentioned. \n\nSource [8] also references Trump's actions regarding the Hunter Biden laptop, but it's about revoking security clearances, which aligns with the speech content. \n\nAdditionally, source [11] includes a transcript where Trump talks about the laptop, but that's from a different event (Alabama GOP dinner). The key here is the specific DOJ appearance on March 14. \n\nSince the resolution conditions state that any usage of the term, including possessive or plural forms, counts, and the examples from the transcripts show Trump used \"laptop\" in his speech, the answer should be \"Yes.\" There's no ambiguity here; the term was clearly spoken during the event. Therefore, the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did say \"laptop\" during his March 14, 2025 Department of Justice appearance. In his speech, he referenced Hunter Biden's laptop controversy while discussing security clearance revocations, stating: \n\n**\"My Administration stripped the security clearances of the disgraced intelligence agents who lied about Hunter Biden's laptop from hell\"**[6][9]. \n\nThis direct reference to \"laptop\" meets the resolution criteria outlined in the ancillary data:\n- The term was used in its base form (not conjugated or compounded)\n- Appeared during the qualifying event timeframe\n- Was captured in official speech transcripts and video evidence[6][9][14]\n\nThe context aligns with Trump's longstanding focus on the Hunter Biden laptop story, which had recently been validated through its use as evidence in Hunter Biden's June 2024 gun trial[1][8]. While other speakers and documents referenced the laptop controversy[3][12], Trump's own usage during the designated DOJ speech satisfies the specific resolution conditions.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907232 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:53:52 UTC",
