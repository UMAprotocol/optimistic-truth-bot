        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the close prices of BTCUSDT 1-minute candles on Binance for March 17 and March 18, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the close price on the 18th is higher (Up, p2) or lower (Down, p1) than the 17th. If equal, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to convert the ET times to UTC because Binance uses UTC. March 17, 12:00 PM ET is 16:00 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). Similarly, March 18, 12:00 PM ET is also 16:00 UTC. \n\nNext, I check the search results for relevant data. Result 19 mentions the price on March 17, 2025, as $83,415.60 at 06:26 AM UTC, but that's earlier in the day. The key is the 1-minute candle at 16:00 UTC. \n\nLooking at result 17, the daily update on March 19 mentions BTC's price movement, but it's from March 18. However, result 19's analysis on March 17 shows a closing price around $83,415.60, but the exact 16:00 UTC candle isn't specified. \n\nResult 15 from March 24 states that BTC was trading around $87,000, but that's after the dates in question. Result 10 from March 24 mentions a drop below 88,000 USDT, but again, after the relevant period. \n\nResult 14 from March 17, 06:26 AM UTC, shows BTC at 82,988.72 USDT, but this is before 16:00 UTC. The critical data points for 16:00 UTC on both days aren't directly provided in the search results. Without explicit data for those exact times, I can't definitively determine the close prices. \n\nSince the user specified that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1-minute candles, and the provided search results don't include the specific 16:00 UTC candles for both days, there's insufficient verifiable information. Therefore, the market can't be resolved and defaults to p4. However, the ancillary data defines p3 for equal prices, but since the data isn't available, the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve).\n</think>\n\nThe market resolution depends on comparing the closing prices of BTC/USDT 1-minute candles at 12:00 PM ET (16:00 UTC) on March 17 and March 18, 2025, as per Binance data.  \n\n**Key analysis:**  \n- **March 17 closing price**: The BTC/USDT price at 16:00 UTC on March 17, 2025, is not explicitly provided in the search results. While a March 17 analysis mentions a price of $83,415.60[19], this appears to reflect an earlier timestamp (06:26 UTC)[14], not the required 16:00 UTC candle.  \n- **March 18 closing price**: No direct data for the 16:00 UTC candle on March 18 exists in the provided sources. Subsequent price movements (e.g., $88,292 on March 17[18] and $87,984 on March 24[10]) fall outside the resolution window.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The search results lack verifiable closing prices for the specified 1-minute candles. Without explicit confirmation of these values from Binance\u2019s historical data (the designated resolution source), the outcome cannot be definitively determined.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the need to compare the closing prices of BTC/USDT on Binance for specific dates and times. It also correctly converts ET to UTC, adhering to the requirement to use Binance's time zone. The response adheres to the instruction to use Binance as the sole source for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by attempting to find the specific data points required for resolution but notes the absence of these specific data points. It correctly concludes that without the exact data for the specified times, the market cannot be resolved. This reasoning is sound and aligns with the instructions provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question (comparison of specific 1-minute candle close prices on two consecutive days) has not been verified with available data. The recommendation of p4 (cannot resolve) is aligned with the facts presented, as the specific data points required are not available in the search results.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response is focused solely on the required data points and does not infer or assume data not explicitly provided.\n\nHowever, according to the critical rule provided, if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a retry must always be initiated. This is to ensure that every possible avenue to obtain the necessary data is explored before concluding that the market cannot be resolved.\n\n**Decision**:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt resulted in a p4 recommendation. A retry is mandated to ensure all possible data retrieval methods are exhausted.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is logically sound and adheres well to the instructions. However, a retry is required to explore additional data sources or methods that might provide the specific data needed for resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please ensure to exhaust all available and reliable sources to verify the specific closing prices of BTC/USDT on Binance for March 17 and March 18, 2025, at 16:00 UTC.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the closing prices of BTCUSDT on Binance for two specific times: March 17, 2025, at 12:00 ET and March 18, 2025, at 12:00 ET. The resolution depends on whether the close price on the 18th is higher (Up, p2) or lower (Down, p1) than the 17th. If they're equal, it's p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the exact closing prices on those dates and times. Let's look through each source carefully. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of them discuss market analysis, trends, and predictions around those dates but don't explicitly state the closing prices for the specific 1-minute candles at 12:00 ET. For example, result [2] mentions Bitcoin trading at $82,358.69 on March 18, but it's unclear if this is the exact close price at 12:00 ET. Similarly, result [3] from March 17 lists a current price of $83,415.60, but again, the timestamp isn't precise to the required 1-minute window. \n\nResult [7] includes some API data with close prices, but the timestamps don't align with the required dates. The other results discuss price ranges, support levels, and technical analysis but don't provide the exact closing prices needed. \n\nSince the resolution source is specified as Binance's BTCUSDT chart with 1-minute candles selected, the absence of direct data points in the search results means there's no verifiable information to confirm the exact closing prices at those specific times. Without this data, I can't definitively determine whether the price went up or down. \n\nAdditionally, the current date in the scenario is March 25, 2025, which is after the event dates. However, the provided search results don't include historical data for the exact times in question. Even though some sources mention prices around those dates, the lack of precise 1-minute close prices at 12:00 ET means the necessary evidence isn't available. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it's impossible to resolve the market definitively. The recommendation should be p4, indicating insufficient data to determine the outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe market resolution depends on comparing the **BTCUSDT 1-minute closing prices** at **12:00 ET (noon)** on **March 17 and March 18, 2025**, as per Binance data. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **March 17, 2025 (12:00 ET):**  \n   - Search results indicate a price of **$83,415.60** at the time of analysis on March 17[3][9], but this does not explicitly confirm the 12:00 ET 1-minute closing price.  \n   - Technical analysis from March 17 describes a **bearish short-term trend** with resistance at $84,500 and support at $83,000[3][9], but no direct 1-minute candle data is provided.  \n\n2. **March 18, 2025 (12:00 ET):**  \n   - Multiple sources report Bitcoin trading at **$82,358.69** on March 18[2][4][10][13], but again, none specify the exact 1-minute closing price at 12:00 ET.  \n   - Market analysis for March 18 highlights a **bearish 4h trend** with key resistance at $83,052 and support at $82,000[2][4].  \n\n### Critical Gaps:\n- **No explicit 1-minute closing prices** for the specified times (12:00 ET on both days) are found in the search results.  \n- The provided data includes **aggregate prices** (e.g., hourly/daily ranges) and **technical projections**, but not the granular 1-minute resolution required by the ancillary data.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe available sources do not contain verifiable **1-minute closing prices** for BTCUSDT at **12:00 ET** on March 17 or 18, 2025. Without this specific data, the market cannot be definitively resolved.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on the specific event and the exact terms required for resolution, which is the comparison of the BTCUSDT 1-minute closing prices on Binance at 12:00 ET on March 17 and March 18, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the resolution depends on these specific data points.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the lack of specific 1-minute candle data at the required times, despite the presence of general market data around those dates. It correctly concludes that without the exact data, the outcome cannot be definitively determined. This reasoning is sound given the constraints and requirements specified in the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event in question (the specific 1-minute candle closing prices on specified dates) has not been documented in the available sources with the necessary precision. The recommendation of p4 (indicating that the query cannot be resolved at this time due to insufficient data) aligns with this finding.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors. It remains focused on the required data and does not infer or assume beyond what is verifiable. However, the response could potentially explore additional data sources or methods, such as directly accessing Binance's historical data through APIs or other data services that might provide minute-specific historical data.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response has logically concluded the lack of necessary data to resolve the query, it is appropriate to consider whether a third attempt would realistically yield different results. The response has already improved by critically evaluating the available sources and adhering closely to the requirements for specific, minute-level data.\n\nDecision:\nConsidering the thoroughness of the response in exploring available information and its adherence to the prompt requirements, and given that this is already a second attempt, it seems unlikely that a third attempt would yield new information unless specific new data sources are identified that were previously overlooked.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately assessed the availability of the required specific data and concluded appropriately that it cannot definitively resolve the query due to insufficient data.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935442 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:44:02 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease ensure to exhaust all available and reliable sources to verify the specific closing prices of BTC/USDT on Binance for March 17 and March 18, 2025, at 16:00 UTC.
