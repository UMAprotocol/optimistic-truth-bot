        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Strategic\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he used that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles detailing Trump's speech. Let's look through them.\n\nSearch result [10] is a transcript from Rev.com. In the transcript, Trump says, \"I signed an order creating the brand new strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile...\" Here, \"strategic\" is used as part of \"strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\" That's the exact term \"Strategic\" in the context of the reserve.\n\nSearch result [12] is a YouTube transcript. It also includes the line: \"creating the brand new strategic Bitcoin reserve and a US digital asset stockpile.\" Again, \"strategic\" is used here.\n\nSearch result [13] from PANews provides a translated transcript: \"creating the new Strategic Reserve of Bitcoin and the United States Digital Asset Reserve.\" Here, \"Strategic\" is capitalized, which still counts as the term is case-insensitive per the rules.\n\nSearch result [15] from Blockhead.co quotes Trump: \"I signed an order creating the brand new strategic Bitcoin Reserve...\" Again, \"strategic\" is present.\n\nThe ancillary data mentions that any usage of the term \"Strategic\" regardless of context counts, including possessive or plural forms. In all these instances, \"strategic\" is used as part of \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,\" which fits the criteria. The term is used in its singular form, and even though it's part of a compound term (\"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\"), the rules state that compound words count as long as the exact term is included. \n\nThe updates mention that the video address counts, so even though it's a pre-recorded message, it's still valid. The event took place on March 20, and the speech was delivered, so no cancellation issues.\n\nTherefore, Trump did say \"Strategic\" during his speech. The answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did use the word \"Strategic\" during his March 20, 2025 Digital Asset Summit speech. In his recorded address, he explicitly stated: \"I signed an order creating the brand new **strategic Bitcoin Reserve** and the US Digital Asset Stockpile\" [10][12][13][15]. The term \"strategic\" was used in its singular form as part of the official policy name \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,\" fulfilling the market's resolution criteria.  \n\nThe speech occurred within the specified timeframe, and the video recording confirms the utterance of \"strategic\" in context. No cancellations or technical issues affected the event.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929199 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:59:59 UTC",
