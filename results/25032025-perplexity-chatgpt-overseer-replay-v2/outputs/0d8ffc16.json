Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] mentions Die Linke got 8.8% of the vote.\n- Source [2] shows a table with Die Linke at 8.8%.\n- Source [3] states they secured 8.7%.\n- Source [5] also reports 8.8%.\n- Source [6] confirms 8.8%.\n- Source [7] doesn't give exact numbers but notes Die Linke's improvement.\n- Source [8] has detailed results for Saxony, but the national total is 8.8%.\n\nAll the reliable sources, including the official ones like the Federal Returning Officer's data in source [6], agree that Die Linke received 8.8% of the second votes (party list votes). This is well above the 5% threshold. The election was held on February 23, 2025, which is before the June 30 deadline. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe Left (Die Linke) secured 8.8% of the party list votes in the February 23, 2025 German federal election, according to official results from the Federal Returning Officer[6]. This exceeds the 5% threshold required for parliamentary representation, marking their best result since 2017 and a significant recovery from their 2021 performance of 4.9%[1][2][5][6].

The response accurately reports that Die Linke received 8.8% of the votes, which is above the 5% threshold required for the market to resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from multiple sources, confirming the consistency of the vote percentage (8.8%) across various reports. It correctly concludes that the market should resolve to \"Yes\" based on the factual data provided by the official source.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the election took place on the specified date and that the results are from a reliable and official source. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Yes\" (p2) aligns perfectly with the factual outcome of the event as per the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the required information and avoids unnecessary speculation or irrelevant details.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985608 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:40:08 UTC"
