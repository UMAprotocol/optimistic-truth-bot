The ancillary data specifies that if the Rockets win, it's p1; Hawks win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, check the event date. The game was on March 25, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 26, 2025. So, no need to consider future dates. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] and [2] both state the Rockets won 121-114. Source [4] and [5] also mention the Rockets' victory. Even the YouTube highlights in [6] and [7] back this up. The box score in [9] shows the final score, Rockets 121, Hawks 114. \n\nNo sources mention postponement or cancellation. All indicate the game was played as scheduled. Since the Rockets won, the resolution should be p1. Need to make sure there's no conflicting info, but all sources align. No need for p3 or p2. Confident in recommending p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Houston Rockets defeated the Atlanta Hawks 121-114 in their NBA game on March 25, 2025. Jalen Green led the Rockets with 32 points and 11 rebounds, while Fred VanVleet contributed 21 points[1][2]. The Rockets maintained control for most of the game, building a 20-point lead by the third quarter, though the Hawks narrowed the gap to four points in the fourth quarter before Houston secured the win[1][4].  \n\n**Key Details**  \n- **Final Score**: Rockets 121, Hawks 114[1][2][9]  \n- **Rockets\u2019 Standings**: Improved to 47-26, strengthening their hold on the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference[2][4]  \n- **Hawks\u2019 Performance**: Trae Young and Dyson Daniels each scored 19 points, but Atlanta\u2019s 28% three-point shooting and 14 turnovers proved costly[4][5]  \n\nThe game was played as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, and it aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n**Evaluation of the Response:**\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:** The response correctly identifies that the game occurred on March 25, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. It verifies the Rockets' victory over the Hawks with a score of 121-114 through multiple sources, which is consistent with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:** The response logically processes the information by checking the event date, confirming the game's occurrence, and verifying the outcome through various sources. It provides a detailed account of the game, including key players and scores, which supports the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:** The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Rockets win) directly with the verified outcome and the ancillary data conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:** There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any deviation from the facts or the user prompt's requirements.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of the event's outcome and the strict adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and reliable for resolving the oracle request.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and provides a detailed verification of the event using multiple sources.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743017393 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:29:53 UTC"
