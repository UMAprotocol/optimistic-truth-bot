The ancillary data specifies that if the Sabres win, it's p2 (Sabres), Bruins win is p1 (Bruins), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the game's date of March 17. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the result using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] mentions the Sabres won 3-2 in overtime. Source [2] also states the Sabres beat the Bruins 3-2 in OT. Similarly, sources [3], [5], [6], [7], and [8] all report the Sabres' victory with the same score. The key detail here is that the Sabres won in overtime, which counts as a regular win in NHL, so the market should resolve to Sabres (p2). \n\nI also need to check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, so no cancellation or postponement issues. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Buffalo Sabres and Boston Bruins on March 17, 2025, concluded with the **Sabres winning 3-2 in overtime** at TD Garden. Alex Tuch scored the game-winning power-play goal with 10.7 seconds remaining in overtime, assisted by Owen Power and Jack Quinn[1][5][6][7]. This result ended the Sabres' eight-game road losing streak and marked their third win in four games[2][6]. \n\nKey details from the game:\n- **Buffalo\u2019s goals**: Peyton Krebs (1st period, power play), Owen Power (2nd period), and Alex Tuch (overtime, power play)[1][6][7].\n- **Boston\u2019s goals**: Pavel Zacha and Morgan Geekie (both in the 1st period)[3][6].\n- The Sabres outshot the Bruins 30-19, with Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen making 17 saves for Buffalo and Joonas Korpisalo stopping 27 shots for Boston[1][2][6].\n\nSince the game was completed as scheduled and the Sabres secured the victory, the market resolves to **Sabres** per the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
