The ancillary data specifies that if North Texas wins, it's p1; Tulsa, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened. Checking the search results, multiple sources [2][4][5][6][8] report that North Texas won 77-59. For example, source [2] is an ESPN recap titled \"North Texas 77-59 Tulsa\" with the date March 14, 2025. Source [4] from Mean Green Sports also states they advanced to the semifinals after beating Tulsa 77-59. Similarly, Tulsa's own site [5] confirms the loss. The YouTube video [6] and CBS Sports [8] recap back this up.\n\nNext, ensure there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. All sources discuss the game as having taken place on the scheduled date. No sources indicate any changes to the game's status. Therefore, the game was completed as planned.\n\nSince North Texas won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All evidence points to a clear North Texas victory without any issues affecting the game's completion.\n</think>\n\nThe American Athletic Conference (AAC) men's basketball tournament quarterfinal game between the North Texas Mean Green and Tulsa Golden Hurricane occurred as scheduled on March 14, 2025, at 7 p.m. ET. **North Texas defeated Tulsa 77-59**, advancing to the semifinals[2][4][5][8]. Key details include:\n\n- **Game Outcome**: North Texas, the No. 2 seed, overcame a halftime deficit (26-31) with a dominant second-half performance, including a 21-3 run, to secure the win[2][4][8].\n- **Key Performers**: Atin Wright led North Texas with 24 points, including 7-of-7 free throws, while Tulsa\u2019s Keaston Willis scored 20 points in his final collegiate game[2][5].\n- **Postseason Implications**: The victory extended North Texas\u2019 winning streak to eight games, while Tulsa\u2019s season ended with a 13-20 record[4][5].\n\nNo sources indicate postponement or cancellation. The game concluded under standard conditions, fulfilling the market\u2019s resolution criteria. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932044 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:47:24 UTC",
