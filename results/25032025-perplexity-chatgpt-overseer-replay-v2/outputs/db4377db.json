        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Vancouver Canucks vs. Calgary Flames game on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Canucks win, it's p2 (Canucks), Flames win p1 (Flames), postponed stays open, canceled resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game on March 12, 2025. Results [1], [2], [5], [6], [8], and [10] all confirm the game took place. TheScore's recap [1] and NHL.com's article [2] both state the Canucks won 4-3 in a shootout. \n\nNext, verify the final outcome. Multiple sources report the Canucks won in a shootout. For example, [1] says Elias Pettersson tied the game late and scored in the shootout, with Conor Garland getting the winner. The NHL.com recap [2] also confirms Garland's shootout goal. The box score [5] and game details [8] list the final score as 4-3 Canucks in a shootout. \n\nCheck for any postponement or cancellation. All sources indicate the game was completed on March 12, so no postponement or cancellation. The house rules from [9] and [13] mention that if the game is completed, bets are settled based on the result. Since the game was played and concluded, the resolution isn't p3.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies a Canucks win resolves to p2. All evidence points to the Canucks winning, so the recommendation should be p2. Need to ensure no conflicting info. Some sources like [3] predicted Flames might win, but the actual result is clear. Also, [12] talks about a different game on March 25, which isn't relevant here. \n\nFinal check: Game occurred, Canucks won in shootout. Therefore, resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks defeated the Calgary Flames 4-3 in a shootout during their March 12, 2025 NHL game[1][2][5][8]. Multiple sources confirm the Canucks overcame a 3-2 third-period deficit when Elias Pettersson tied the game at 13:16 of the final frame, with Conor Garland eventually scoring the shootout winner in the fourth round[1][2][5]. \n\nKey details:\n- Regulation ended 3-3 after Vancouver erased a one-goal deficit\n- The shootout concluded 2-1 in favor of the Canucks[8]\n- Official NHL box scores and recaps verify the outcome[2][5]\n- The game was completed as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations mentioned in any sources[1][2][5][6][8]\n\nSince the market resolution conditions specify p2 (\"Canucks\") for a Vancouver victory and the game was completed without cancellation, this outcome meets the defined criteria for resolution.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935017 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:36:57 UTC"
