The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p1; if the Avalanche win, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened six days ago. No need to worry about future dates here. Next, I need to confirm the actual result of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [7], [12], [14]) report that the Maple Leafs won 2-1. The key details: Joseph Woll made 38 saves, Steven Lorentz scored the short-handed winner in the third period. The Avalanche's point streak ended, and the Leafs secured their second straight win. \n\nI should cross-verify to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources consistently state the Leafs' victory. The box scores, game recaps, and highlights all align. No mentions of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nSince the game occurred and the Maple Leafs won, the resolution should be p1. The ancillary data's conditions are met without any ambiguity. No need to consider other outcomes as the result is clear and well-documented across multiple reliable sources.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Colorado Avalanche and Toronto Maple Leafs on March 19, 2025, concluded with a **2-1 victory for the Toronto Maple Leafs**[1][3][7][12][14]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Joseph Woll** made 38 saves for Toronto, including critical stops in the third period to preserve the lead[1][3][12].\n- **Steven Lorentz** scored the game-winning goal short-handed at 2:53 of the third period after a clearing attempt deflected off referee Kelly Sutherland, creating a 2-on-1 break[1][3][12][14].\n- **Auston Matthews** opened the scoring with a power-play goal, his fourth in three games[1][3][12].\n\nThe Avalanche\u2019s 8-0-1 point streak ended with this regulation loss, their first since February 23[1][3][14]. The result aligns unambiguously with the resolution conditions, as the Maple Leafs secured the win. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Maple Leafs win corresponds to a resolution of p1. The response also correctly disregards the possibilities of postponement or cancellation since there is no evidence suggesting either occurred.\n\nFurthermore, the response provides detailed information about the game, including key players and moments, which supports the credibility of the sources and the factual accuracy of the event's outcome. This level of detail ensures that the resolution is not only based on the final score but also on a comprehensive understanding of how the game unfolded, which is in line with the requirement for concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nThere are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the conditions outlined for resolution, focusing solely on the specific event mentioned in the user prompt without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908447 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:14:07 UTC"
