        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know whether Real Madrid or Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid advanced in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Atl\u00e9tico, p2 is Real Madrid, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is postponed or canceled beyond December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The second leg of the Round of 16 was scheduled for March 12, 2025, as per search result [4]. Since that date has already passed, the event has occurred, so there's no need to consider p3. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]) mention the second leg match on March 12. The first leg ended 2-1 in favor of Real Madrid ([1], [3], [4]). The second leg was a 1-0 win for Atl\u00e9tico, leading to a 2-2 aggregate, which went into extra time and then penalties. \n\nMultiple sources ([5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]) confirm that Real Madrid won the penalty shootout 4-2. Key moments include Conor Gallagher's early goal for Atl\u00e9tico, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior's missed penalty, and Antonio R\u00fcdiger scoring the decisive penalty. Julian Alvarez's disallowed penalty due to touching the ball twice is also noted. \n\nSince the official outcome, as per UEFA, would reflect the penalty shootout result, Real Madrid advanced to the quarter-finals. All sources align on this outcome without any contradictions. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2 (Real Madrid).\n</think>\n\nReal Madrid advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals after defeating Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 4-2 in a penalty shootout following a 2-2 aggregate draw across both legs of their Round of 16 tie[5][7][8][10][12]. \n\n**Key details:**\n- **First Leg (March 4, 2025):** Real Madrid won 2-1 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u with goals from Rodrygo and Brahim D\u00edaz, while Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez scored for Atl\u00e9tico[1][3][4].\n- **Second Leg (March 12, 2025):** Atl\u00e9tico won 1-0 at the Metropolitano Stadium via Conor Gallagher\u2019s 27th-second goal\u2014the fastest by an Englishman in UCL history\u2014to level the aggregate score[5][8][12]. \n- **Penalty Shootout:** Antonio R\u00fcdiger converted the decisive penalty after Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Marco Llorente hit the crossbar and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez\u2019s attempt was disallowed for a double touch[7][8][10]. Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior had earlier missed a penalty in regular time[8][9].\n\nThe result extends Real Madrid\u2019s historical dominance over Atl\u00e9tico in UCL knockout stages, having eliminated them in four consecutive meetings since 2014[8][10]. Real will face Arsenal in the quarter-finals[5][7][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906463 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:41:03 UTC",
