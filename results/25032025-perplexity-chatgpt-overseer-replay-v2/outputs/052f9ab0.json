The ancillary data specifies that if Alabama wins, it's p1; Robert Morris, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the game was scheduled for March 21, 2025. So the game date is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [1][2][5][6] report that Alabama won the game 90-81. For example, source [1] states, \"Robert Morris fell to Alabama 90-81 on Friday,\" and source [6] from ESPN confirms the same score. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources agree on Alabama's victory. \n\nSince the event happened and Alabama won, the resolution should be p1. There's no conflicting information in the sources, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nAlabama defeated Robert Morris 90-81 in their NCAA Tournament first-round matchup on March 21, 2025. The game, held in Cleveland, saw the second-seeded Crimson Tide overcome a strong challenge from the 15th-seeded Colonials. Despite Robert Morris briefly taking a 65-64 lead in the second half, Alabama responded with an 11-2 run led by All-America guard Mark Sears (22 points, 10 assists) and key contributions from Clifford Omoruyi (17 points on 8-8 shooting) and Mouhamed Dioubate (18 points, 10 rebounds)[1][2][5][6]. The result aligns with the resolution conditions specifying an Alabama win as **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate and complete in its analysis and recommendation based on the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Robert Morris vs. Alabama NCAA Tournament game) occurred on March 21, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The response verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which consistently report an Alabama win with a score of 90-81. This aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where an Alabama win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by first establishing the date of the event relative to the current date to confirm it is a past event. It then verifies the outcome through reliable sources, ensuring there is no conflicting information about the game being postponed or canceled. The response concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation of p1 for an Alabama win is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and system instructions, focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it accurately and completely addresses the user prompt with a well-supported and verified recommendation. There is no need for a rerun or default to p4, as the response meets the required standards of accuracy and reliability.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, providing a clear and factual resolution based on the event's verified outcome.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
