        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Hornets vs. Hawks game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hawks win, it's p1; Hornets win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 12, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the result using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple results mention the March 12 game. Source [1] from CBS Sports states the Hawks won 123-110. Source [3] is a YouTube highlight confirming the same score. Source [5] from Fox Sports also lists the final score as Hawks 123, Hornets 110. Source [7] on StatMuse and [8] from The Score both corroborate the Hawks' victory. \n\nAdditionally, source [4] from Substack discusses a different game on March 18 where the Hawks won again, but that's a separate match. The key here is the March 12 game. All relevant sources agree the Hawks won decisively. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so the game was completed as scheduled. \n\nSince the Hawks won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All checks confirm the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks defeated the Charlotte Hornets 123-110 in their March 12, 2025 matchup, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][3][5][7][8]. Trae Young led the Hawks with 35 points and 12 assists, while Miles Bridges scored 31 points for the Hornets in the losing effort. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, with final scores showing Atlanta outscoring Charlotte in all quarters except the first[1][5][8].\n\nKey details from the game:\n- **Final score breakdown**:  \n  | Team | 1Q | 2Q | 3Q | 4Q | Total |\n  |------|----|----|----|----|-------|\n  | CHA  | 29 | 20 | 29 | 32 | 110   |\n  | ATL  | 30 | 22 | 37 | 34 | 123   |\n\n- **Statistical dominance**:  \n  - Hawks made 35/39 free throws (89.7%) vs Hornets' 16/18 (88.9%)[5][8]  \n  - Atlanta's bench outscored Charlotte's reserves 57-18[1]  \n  - Hawks forced 21 turnovers while committing only 13[8]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1][3][5][7][8]. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market should resolve to the Hawks' victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
