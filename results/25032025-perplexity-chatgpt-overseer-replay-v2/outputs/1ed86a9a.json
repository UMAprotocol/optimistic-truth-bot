The ancillary data specifies that if Yale wins, it's p1; Princeton, p2; postponed stays open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 15 is in the past. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [1] is a box score link from Fox Sports, but the content mentions the game is scheduled for March 15, 2025, and lists team stats. However, sources [2] and [3] from the Yale Daily News are more detailed. Source [2] is a live update stating Yale edged Princeton 59-57 in the semifinal. Source [3] confirms the final score as 59-57 Yale, advancing them to the championship. \n\nAdditionally, source [4] (Wikipedia) lists Yale's 2025 appearance in the NCAA tournament, which aligns with them winning the Ivy League semifinal. The other sources [5], [6], [7], [8] are about Yale Law School and financial documents, which aren't relevant here.\n\nSince the game occurred on March 15, 2025, and Yale won 59-57 according to multiple sources, the resolution should be p1 as per the ancillary data. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for resolving to Yale's victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Princeton vs. Yale men's basketball Ivy League semifinal game occurred on March 15, 2025, as scheduled. Yale defeated Princeton with a final score of **59\u201357**[2][3], securing their advancement to the Ivy League Championship. The game remained competitive, with Princeton briefly taking a late lead before Yale\u2019s key players, including John Poulakidas \u201925 and Bez Mbeng \u201925, closed out the victory[3]. No evidence suggests the game was postponed or canceled.  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **Yale** (p1) based on their confirmed win.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Princeton vs. Yale basketball game occurred on March 15, 2025, and that Yale won with a score of 59-57. This outcome is supported by multiple reliable sources, including the Yale Daily News and Wikipedia. The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event's occurrence and outcome based on verified facts, without predicting or assuming.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It correctly identifies the resolution conditions (p1 for Yale win, p2 for Princeton win, p3 for unknown/50-50) and applies them appropriately based on the verified outcome of the game. The reasoning is complete as it covers all necessary aspects: checking the event date, verifying the outcome, and ruling out postponement or cancellation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable and consistent. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yale\" (p1) aligns perfectly with the facts presented and the ancillary data conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no missing critical pieces of information, noticeable bias, or errors in the response. The response focuses solely on the relevant event and uses appropriate sources for verification.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Princeton vs. Yale basketball game, correctly applies the resolution conditions, and aligns the recommendation with verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and adheres strictly to the user prompt instructions without any observable errors or bias.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
