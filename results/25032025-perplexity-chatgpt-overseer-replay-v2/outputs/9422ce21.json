The user wants to know whether Borussia Dortmund or Lille advanced in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16, based on the provided search results. The ancillary data specifies that if Dortmund advances, it resolves to \"Dortmund\" (p2), and if Lille advances, it's \"Lille\" (p1). If the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The second leg of the match was played on March 12, 2025, as per the search results. Since the event date is in the past, I need to verify the outcome from the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] mentions that Borussia Dortmund came from behind to beat Lille 2-1 in the second leg, advancing 3-2 on aggregate. Source [2] also states Dortmund's 2-1 win and their advancement to the quarterfinals against Barcelona. Source [4] from ESPN provides a detailed match report, including the goalscorers and the aggregate score, confirming Dortmund's progression. Additionally, source [7] notes that the first leg ended 1-1 and that Lille needed to break their draw streak against Dortmund but failed to do so in the second leg.\n\nAll the sources consistently report that Dortmund won the second leg and advanced. There's no mention of the match being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the correct resolution is p2 (Dortmund). I need to ensure that the event in question is the same as described and that the sources are reliable. Since all sources, including official ones like Bundesliga's website and ESPN, confirm the result, the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nBorussia Dortmund advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals by defeating Lille 3-2 on aggregate in the Round of 16. After a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Germany, Dortmund secured a 2-1 comeback victory in the second leg in France on March 12, 2025[1][2][4]. Key moments included **Emre Can**'s penalty equalizer (54') and **Maximilian Beier**'s winning goal (65') after Lille's early lead from **Jonathan David** (5')[1][4]. The result set up a quarterfinal clash with Barcelona[1][2]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923968 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:32:48 UTC"
