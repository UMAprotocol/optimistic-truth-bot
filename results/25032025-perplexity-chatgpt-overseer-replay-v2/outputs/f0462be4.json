The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for a basketball game between Louisiana Tech and Middle Tennessee that was scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Louisiana Tech wins, the market resolves to p2 (Louisiana Tech), and if Middle Tennessee wins, it resolves to p1 (Middle Tennessee). If postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it resolves 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on or before the current date, which is March 26, 2025. The game was on March 13, so it's in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]) mention the game on March 13, 2025. Specifically, source [10] from CBS Sports states that Middle Tennessee won 77-75 in double overtime. Other sources like [13] and [14] also confirm the final score as 77-75 in favor of Middle Tennessee. The box score in [15] shows Middle Tennessee with 77 points and Louisiana Tech with 75. \n\nSince the game was played and completed, there's no need to consider postponement or cancellation. The result is clear: Middle Tennessee won. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Middle Tennessee). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All relevant sources agree on the outcome. No sources suggest the game was postponed or canceled. Thus, the resolution is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe March 13, 2025 Conference USA Tournament quarterfinal basketball game between Louisiana Tech and Middle Tennessee was played as scheduled and resulted in a **77-75 double-overtime victory for Middle Tennessee**[10][13][14]. Multiple sources confirm the Blue Raiders secured the win with Essam Mostafa's game-winning basket in the final seconds of the second overtime period[10][14]. \n\nKey details:\n- Final score: Middle Tennessee 77, Louisiana Tech 75 (2OT)\n- Game occurred on March 13, 2025 at Von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL\n- No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in the search results\n\nBased on the ancillary data's resolution conditions and the verified outcome, the market should resolve to **Middle Tennessee** as the winner.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The reasoning is thorough and leads directly to the resolution recommendation based on the outcome of the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 (Middle Tennessee) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided, where p1 corresponds to a Middle Tennessee win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and uses verified sources to confirm the game's outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985610 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:40:10 UTC"
