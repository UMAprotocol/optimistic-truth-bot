The key here is to determine the outcome of the game based on verified facts and the provided sources. \n\nFirst, I need to check the date of the event. The game was scheduled for March 13, 2025. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the event date. So, the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the result using the search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [7] from conferenceusa.com clearly states that Kennesaw State defeated NM State 80-77 in the quarterfinal round on March 13, 2025. This is a direct report of the game's outcome. Additionally, source [4] from Fox Sports mentions that Simeon Cottle scored 32 points leading Kennesaw State to a victory over New Mexico State, advancing them to the semifinals. \n\nOther sources like [2] and [5] discuss predictions and odds before the game, but since the event has already happened, the actual result from [7] and [4] takes precedence. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution conditions don't apply to those scenarios. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Kennesaw State wins, the market resolves to p1, which is \"Kennesaw State\". Since the verified result is a Kennesaw State win, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between New Mexico State and Kennesaw State occurred on March 13, 2025, as scheduled. **Kennesaw State defeated New Mexico State 80-77** in the Conference USA Tournament quarterfinals[7]. Simeon Cottle led the Owls with 32 points, tying his career high, while Braedan Lue added a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double[7][4]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up was required.  \n\n**Resolution**: The outcome meets the ancillary data condition for a Kennesaw State win.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response uses verified sources such as conferenceusa.com and Fox Sports to substantiate the game's outcome, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It correctly ignores predictions and odds that are irrelevant post-event and focuses on the actual results, which is a sound approach.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It aligns the outcome of the event with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a win by Kennesaw State corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not omit any crucial information necessary for the resolution of the query.\n\nBased on the analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
