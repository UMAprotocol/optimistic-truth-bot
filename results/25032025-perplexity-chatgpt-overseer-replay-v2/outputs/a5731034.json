The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his press conference with Ireland's PM Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. But wait, the ancillary data says the market is about Donald Trump's press conference with Martin, not Zelenskyy. That's a key point. The user might have mixed up the names, but according to the resolution conditions, it's Trump's appearance that matters.\n\nFirst, I need to check the event details. The press conference in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception with the Taoiseach on March 12 at 5 PM ET. The search results mention several events around that time. From [2], [3], and [7], Trump met with Martin on March 12, discussing trade and other issues. The main event was the reception, which is the focus here.\n\nLooking through the transcripts and summaries of Trump's speeches during that period, especially the White House Digital Assets Summit on March 7 [1][11][18], Trump talked extensively about cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and even mentioned the \"FIFA Coin.\" However, these events are on March 7, not the 12th. The March 12 event with Martin, as per [2][3][7], focused more on trade, tariffs, and Ireland's pharmaceutical industry. The transcripts from the March 12 event don't mention Trump using \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during the press conference or reception. \n\nThe update changes the resolution source to the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. The search results for that specific event don't indicate any discussion of cryptocurrency terms. Instead, the discussions were about US-Ireland relations, trade deficits, and geopolitical issues. Therefore, Trump didn't say \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during that particular event. \n\nSince the event occurred as scheduled and the resolution is based on the video evidence from that reception, which doesn't show the terms being used, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

This shows adherence to the prompt's requirement to focus on the specified event and individuals. The response also correctly identifies the event date and the nature of the event, aligning with the provided updates.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the details of the event and reviewing transcripts and summaries to determine if the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" were mentioned by Trump. It correctly concludes that these terms were not used during the event in question, based on the evidence from the event's transcripts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and uses the correct source (video of the event) to determine whether the terms were mentioned. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) is based on the absence of the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" in the event's discourse, which aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response effectively uses the information available and adheres to the conditions set forth in the user prompt and updates.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it accurately and completely addresses the query based on the verified facts and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns with the facts verified from the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the correct individuals involved, verifies the event details, and logically concludes based on the evidence from the event.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928927 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:55:27 UTC",
