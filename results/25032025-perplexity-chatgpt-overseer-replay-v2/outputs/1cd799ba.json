        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Beautiful\" five or more times during his Education Event on March 20, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any transcripts or mentions of Trump's speech during that event. Looking through the provided sources, several mention the event. Source [9] is a YouTube transcript of the event. Let me scan through that. \n\nIn the transcript, Trump says, \"look at those beautiful brigh eyed faces\" and refers to Alaska as \"Beautiful Alaska.\" That's two instances. Wait, the exact quote is: \"look at those beautiful brigh eyed faces those they are so smart they're so smart...\" and earlier, \"renamed \u2014 for a great president, William McKinley \u2014 Mount McKinley again. (Applause.) Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska.\" So that's two uses of \"beautiful.\"\n\nAnother mention in source [10] from the White House's YouTube channel: \"we want to have our children well educated and we want them to love going to school.\" But no \"beautiful\" there. \n\nSource [14] is another transcript of the same event. Let me check that. The transcript here includes: \"Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska.\" That's the same as before. Then later, \"look at those beautiful brigh eyed faces...\" Again, two instances. \n\nWait, are there more? Let me check again. In source [9], during the speech, Trump also says, \"it's going to be an amazing thing to watch and it's really going to be special.\" No \"beautiful\" there. \n\nLooking at source [15], the Associated Press article mentions the event but doesn't quote Trump using \"beautiful.\" Similarly, source [16] from KUT and [17] from Le Monde don't mention the word. \n\nSource [18] is a PBS video transcript, but it's about the implications of dismantling the Education Department, not the speech content. \n\nSo, based on the available transcripts from the event (sources [9] and [14]), Trump used \"beautiful\" twice. The user's query requires five or more instances. Since the transcripts only show two uses, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, I need to ensure there are no other mentions in other sources. \n\nLooking at other sources: source [2] discusses Trump's comments on Kamala Harris's appearance but that's a different event. Source [6] has quotes about Bette Midler and \"beautiful\" but again, not from the Education Event. \n\nTherefore, the count is two instances of \"beautiful,\" which is less than five. The market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nPresident Trump used the word \"beautiful\" **twice** during the March 20, 2025 Education Event and Executive Order signing, falling short of the five required instances for a \"Yes\" resolution.  \n\n**Key evidence from the event transcript** ([9][14]):  \n1. Referencing Alaska: *\"Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska.\"*  \n2. Describing children at the event: *\"look at those beautiful brigh eyed faces\"*  \n\nNo other instances of \"beautiful\" were identified in verified transcripts or coverage of the specific event. While Trump has a history of using the term frequently in other contexts (e.g., describing women, landscapes, or objects in unrelated speeches[2][6][11]), these fall outside the scope of the defined market parameters.  \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that **only usage during the scheduled Education Event** counts, and pluralization/possessive forms would qualify. Neither occurred in this case.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment with the facts provided in the user prompt. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions by focusing solely on the event specified (the Education Event on March 20, 2025) and counting the instances of the word \"beautiful\" as mentioned in the transcripts. The response correctly identifies that only two instances of the word \"beautiful\" were used, which is less than the five required for a \"Yes\" resolution. This is in line with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking multiple sources for instances of the word \"beautiful\" during the specified event. It correctly disregards mentions of the word in different contexts or events, adhering strictly to the event in question. The response also ensures that no other sources or instances were overlooked by rechecking the sources cited.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the facts found in the transcripts. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) is based on the concrete evidence that Trump used the word \"beautiful\" only twice during the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks and cross-references the available sources to ensure the accuracy of the count of the word \"beautiful.\"\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts verified from the event transcripts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately counts the instances of the word 'beautiful' during the specified event and adheres strictly to the user prompt's conditions. The recommendation to resolve the market to 'No' is based on verified facts and is logically sound.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to verify the occurrence and specifics of the event, ensuring that the resolution recommendation is accurate and reliable.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932596 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:56:36 UTC",
