        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) based on whether an official ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine was reached by March 14, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The deadline for the ceasefire was March 14, so any events after that don't count. Now, looking at the search results, there's a lot of information about negotiations, but I need to focus on whether an official agreement was announced by both parties before the deadline.\n\nFrom the sources, there were talks in Saudi Arabia around March 24-25, but those are after the deadline. The key is to find any announcements before March 14. \n\nLooking at source [2], dated March 14, it mentions that the US and Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposal, but Russia hadn't accepted it yet. Source [6] from March 14 states that Putin rejected the US-Ukrainian proposal. Source [12] from March 20 confirms that in the March 18 call, Putin didn't agree to a comprehensive ceasefire but only to suspend attacks on energy infrastructure. \n\nSource [14] mentions a joint statement on March 11 where Ukraine agreed to a ceasefire contingent on Russian approval, which wasn't given by the deadline. Source [15] on March 14 quotes Putin demanding Ukraine's surrender, which isn't a ceasefire agreement.\n\nNone of the sources indicate a mutual official agreement by March 14. The closest was Ukraine agreeing, but Russia didn't. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nThe market resolves to \"No\" (p1) as no official ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine was reached by March 14, 2025. While negotiations occurred, key developments show:\n\n- **Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire on March 11**, contingent on Russian approval[14], but **Russia rejected the proposal** on March 13\u201314, with Putin demanding territorial concessions and Ukrainian disarmament[2][6][12].\n\n- **Putin rebuffed Trump\u2019s push for a full ceasefire** during their March 18 call, agreeing only to a limited pause in strikes on energy infrastructure[9][12][13]. This fell short of the \"mutually agreed halt in military engagement\" required by the resolution terms.\n\n- **No joint statement or credible media consensus** confirmed an official ceasefire by the March 14 deadline. Russian state media reported bilateral U.S.-Russia talks ending on March 24\u201325 (after the deadline), with a joint statement expected afterward[1][8], but these discussions focused on Black Sea security, not a comprehensive ceasefire.\n\nHumanitarian pauses or unilateral Ukrainian agreements without Russian acceptance do not meet the resolution criteria.",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's requirement to determine if an official ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine was reached by March 14, 2025. The AI correctly identifies that the event's resolution date has passed and provides a detailed analysis based on multiple sources to confirm that no official ceasefire agreement was reached by the specified date.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by systematically analyzing the events leading up to the deadline and checking for any official announcements or mutual agreements. It correctly concludes that while Ukraine showed willingness to agree to a ceasefire, Russia did not reciprocate, and thus, no mutual agreement was reached.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation aligns well with the facts presented and verified from the sources. It correctly identifies that the conditions for a \"Yes\" resolution (mutual agreement on a ceasefire) were not met, and therefore, recommends resolving the market to \"No\" (p1).\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI effectively uses the sources to construct a narrative that is in line with the user prompt's requirements. It does not appear to omit any significant information that would affect the outcome of its recommendation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and proper alignment with the user prompt's conditions. The AI has effectively analyzed the available information and provided a well-supported recommendation.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's conditions, provides a logical and complete analysis based on verified facts, and aligns the recommendation correctly with the established facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the absence of a mutual ceasefire agreement by the specified deadline, leading to a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909356 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:29:16 UTC",
