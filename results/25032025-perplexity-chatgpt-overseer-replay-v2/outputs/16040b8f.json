        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether a motion of no confidence against Justin Trudeau passed in the Canadian House of Commons between December 15, 2024, and March 31, 2025. The resolution conditions are clear: if a motion passes during that period while Trudeau is PM, it's \"Yes\" (p2). If not, or if he ceased being PM before a motion passed, it's \"No\" (p1). \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events from the provided search results. The search results mention several no-confidence motions against Trudeau. Let's look at the dates. \n\nSearch result [1] from December 10, 2024, states that Trudeau's government survived a third no-confidence vote. The vote was defeated 180-150. So that's before the user's date range starts (December 15), so that doesn't count. \n\nThen, result [3] from December 20, 2024, mentions the NDP planning to trigger a no-confidence vote after lawmakers reconvene on January 27, 2025. But Trudeau reshuffled his cabinet, and the NDP leader said they would bring a motion. However, the next key point is result [5], also from December 10, 2024, which again confirms the third motion failed. \n\nMoving to January 2025, result [2] and [8] from January 6-7, 2025, state that Trudeau announced his resignation as Liberal leader and PM, effective once a new leader is chosen. He also prorogued Parliament until March 24, 2025. Prorogation means Parliament is suspended, so no confidence votes can occur during that period. \n\nResult [10] and [9] mention that prorogation was granted, and Parliament would resume on March 24. The user's current date is March 25, 2025. So after prorogation ended, the next session started. However, Trudeau resigned as Liberal leader on January 6, but remained PM until a new leader was chosen. The Liberal leadership election was held from February 26 to March 9, 2025 (result [13]), and Trudeau stepped down as PM once the new leader was selected. \n\nAccording to result [9], the new leader was chosen on March 9, so Trudeau ceased to be PM on that date. The market's end date is March 31, 2025. So between March 9 and March 31, Trudeau was no longer PM. Any no-confidence motions after March 9 would not count because he wasn't PM anymore. \n\nNow, during the period from December 15, 2024, to March 9, 2025, were there any successful no-confidence motions? The search results [3], [5], [6] all mention failed motions in December 2024. After prorogation, Parliament resumed on March 24, but by then Trudeau had already resigned as PM. \n\nResult [11] mentions that Trudeau resigned on January 6, 2025, and Parliament was prorogued until March 24. The prorogation meant no confidence votes could happen only after March 24. But by then, Trudeau was no longer PM. \n\nTherefore, during the specified period, all no-confidence motions failed, and Trudeau ceased being PM before any could pass after prorogation. Hence, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nJustin Trudeau's government faced multiple no-confidence motions between December 2024 and March 2025, but none succeeded before his resignation. Three key votes occurred:\n\n1. **December 10, 2024**: A Conservative-led motion failed 180-150, with NDP support keeping Trudeau in power[1][5].\n2. **December 2024**: Subsequent motions also failed due to parliamentary math favoring the Liberals[6].\n\nOn **January 6, 2025**, Trudeau announced his resignation as Liberal leader and requested prorogation of Parliament until **March 24, 2025**[2][8][10]. This suspension prevented further confidence votes until after the Liberal leadership transition. Trudeau remained prime minister until **March 9, 2025**, when his successor was elected[9][13].\n\nBy the time Parliament reconvened on March 24, Trudeau had already left office. The market's cutoff date (March 31, 2025) fell after his departure, and no successful no-confidence votes occurred during his tenure in the specified window.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932374 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:52:54 UTC",
