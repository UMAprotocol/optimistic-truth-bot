        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Gujarat Titans vs Punjab Kings IPL match scheduled for March 25, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Punjab Kings win, it's p1 (Punjab), if Gujarat Titans win, p2 (Gujarat), and if the game isn't completed by March 31, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 26, 2025, 7:07 PM UTC. The match was supposed to be on March 25, so it's already in the past. Now, I need to verify the match result using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [4], [5], [6], [8]) report that Punjab Kings (PBKS) defeated Gujarat Titans (GT) by 11 runs. For example, source [1] mentions \"PBKS\u2019 11-run win over Gujarat Titans,\" and source [4] states \"Punjab Kings hold nerve to beat Gujarat Titans by 11 runs.\" Additionally, the captain of Gujarat Titans, Shubman Gill, acknowledged the loss in source [6], saying they conceded too many runs. \n\nSince the match was completed and the result is clear, there's no need to consider the p3 condition about the game not being completed. All sources confirm Punjab's victory. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 as per the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nThe Gujarat Titans vs Punjab Kings IPL 2025 match occurred on March 25, 2025, as scheduled. **Punjab Kings (PBKS) defeated Gujarat Titans (GT) by 11 runs** in a high-scoring encounter at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium[1][4][8]. PBKS posted a record T20 total of 243/5 at the venue, powered by Shreyas Iyer's 97* (42 balls) and Shashank Singh's 44* (16 balls)[5][8]. GT's chase fell short despite strong contributions from Sai Sudharsan (74), Jos Buttler (54), and Sherfane Rutherford (46)[1][8].\n\nKey factors in the outcome:\n- **PBKS batting dominance**: Their total surpassed GT's previous venue record[5]\n- **GT's costly bowling**: Expensive spells from Mohammed Siraj (0/54), Rashid Khan (1/48), and Kagiso Rabada (1/41)[6]\n- **Death over containment**: Vyshak Vijaykumar's tight 15th and 17th overs (5 runs each) derailed GT's chase[2]\n\nThe match concluded without delays or cancellations, meeting all resolution criteria. As Punjab Kings won decisively, the market resolves to their designated outcome. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Gujarat Titans vs Punjab Kings IPL match on March 25, 2025) and verifies the outcome using multiple sources. The response adheres to the instruction to report based on verified facts and does not predict or assume outcomes without evidence. The match result is confirmed with specific details about the game, including scores and key performances, which aligns with the requirement to use concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and then checking the outcome of the match. It correctly ignores the p3 condition (50-50 resolution if the match isn't completed by March 31, 2025) since the match was completed on the scheduled date. The reasoning is thorough, with detailed analysis of the match's key moments and individual performances, which supports the final resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through reliable sources, as required. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Punjab win) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Punjab win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The information provided is relevant and directly pertains to the query. All necessary details to resolve the query are included, and there is no missing information that could affect the resolution's accuracy.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on verified facts and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions.

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015961 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:06:01 UTC"
