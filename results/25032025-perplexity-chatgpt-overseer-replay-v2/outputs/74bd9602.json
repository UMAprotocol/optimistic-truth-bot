The ancillary data specifies that if the Bulls win, it's p1; if the Nets win, p2; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game on March 13, 2025, with detailed recaps from sources like CBS Sports, ESPN, and ABC7. Both [1] and [2] report the Bulls won 116-110. The final scores are consistent across multiple sources, including the box score in [6] showing Bulls 116, Nets 110. \n\nNext, check for any postponement or cancellation. Search result [3] talks about NBA games rescheduled due to wildfires and an ice storm, but those were in January 2025. The March 13 game isn't listed there, so it wasn't affected. All sources about the March 13 game confirm it took place.\n\nSince the game occurred and the Bulls won, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting info found. All sources agree on the outcome, so confident in recommending p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Brooklyn Nets and Chicago Bulls scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET took place as planned. According to multiple verified sources, the Chicago Bulls defeated the Brooklyn Nets with a final score of **116-110**[1][2][4][6][7]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Coby White** led the Bulls with 31 points, extending his 20-point game streak to seven[1][2][7].\n- The Bulls overcame a 12-point deficit in the third quarter with a 17-3 run and sealed the win with an 8-0 surge in the final minutes[1][4][6].\n- The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by the detailed play-by-play and postgame coverage[1][2][6][7].\n\nSince the Bulls won the game outright, the market resolves to **p1** as defined by the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924866 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:47:46 UTC"
