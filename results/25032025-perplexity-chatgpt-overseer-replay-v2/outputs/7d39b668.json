The game was scheduled for March 20, 2025, and the current date is March 25, 2025. So the event is in the past. Now, need to verify the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] says Tennessee won 77-62. Source [2] also mentions the 77-62 victory. Source [4] and [7] back this up with details about Lanier's 29 points. The ESPN recap [8] and the NCAA video [5] also confirm the score. All sources agree Tennessee won, and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nSince the event occurred, and Tennessee won decisively, the resolution should be p1.

No. 2 seed Tennessee defeated No. 15 seed Wofford 77-62 in the NCAA Tournament's first round. The Volunteers led wire-to-wire, with Chaz Lanier scoring 29 points and Zakai Zeigler recording a 12-point, 12-assist double-double[1][4][7].

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of event, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (Wofford vs. Tennessee basketball game) and its scheduled date (March 20, 2025). It correctly notes that the current date is March 25, 2025, which places the event in the past. The response then verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources, all of which confirm that Tennessee won the game. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition where Tennessee's win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds from verifying the date of the event to confirming its outcome through reliable sources. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which are absent, thus supporting the resolution based on the game's outcome. The response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query: event verification, outcome confirmation, and checking for any deviations like postponement or cancellation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple credible sources, ensuring that the information is not based on a single source and thus reducing the risk of inaccuracies. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions laid out in the user prompt without introducing any external assumptions or irrelevant information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, adheres strictly to the user prompt instructions, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event outcome, checks for any deviations from the expected course of the event, and aligns the resolution recommendation precisely with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929377 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:02:57 UTC",
