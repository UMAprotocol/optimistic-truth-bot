The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if it did, otherwise \"No\" (p1). The primary source should be Billboard, but since the provided search results don't include a direct link to Billboard's chart, I need to rely on the sources given that reference Billboard's data.\n\nLooking through the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]) mention that \"MUSIC\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. For example, source [1] states it clearly, and others like [8] and [10] confirm the same with specific chart dates and units sold. Even though Carti disputed the sales numbers in source [3], the chart position itself isn't contested. All sources agree on the No. 1 debut, and they reference Billboard as their source. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the album was released on March 14, the chart dated March 29 would be the relevant one, which is covered in the sources. There's no conflicting information about the chart position, so the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nPlayboi Carti's album *MUSIC* debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, as confirmed by multiple sources citing Billboard's data[1][2][3][6][7][8][9][10][11]. The album earned **298,000 equivalent album units** in its first week (ending March 20, 2025), marking the **largest debut for a rap album in 2025** and Carti's second career No. 1 after *Whole Lotta Red* in 2021[1][6][8][10]. Streaming accounted for 283,000 units (284\u2013384 million on-demand streams), while traditional sales contributed 14,500 units[1][3][6][8][11]. \n\nDespite Carti disputing the sales tally on social media, the chart position itself remains uncontested[3][11]. The only 2025 album with a larger debut is The Weeknd\u2019s *Hurry Up Tomorrow* (490,000 units)[1][6][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively uses the specified primary source, Billboard, as referenced indirectly through multiple secondary sources that cite Billboard's data. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and established data regarding the album's chart position.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it confirms the album's number one debut through consistent information across various sources that all reference the primary source, Billboard. The response also correctly identifies the relevant chart date and provides additional context about the album's performance, which supports the resolution without deviating from the required factual basis.\n\nThe recommendation aligns with the facts presented and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies resolution to \"Yes\" (p2) if the album debuted at number 1. The response does not show any significant bias, errors, or missing information that would affect the resolution's accuracy.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the response mentions multiple sources, it does not provide direct evidence from the Billboard website itself, relying instead on secondary sources that cite Billboard. This approach is generally acceptable given the context, but direct confirmation from Billboard would enhance the response's reliability.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
