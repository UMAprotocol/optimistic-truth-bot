  "system_prompt": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923517 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:25:17 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Carney\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she uses that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the deadline is December 31, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there have been any press briefings by Leavitt after March 25, 2025. The search results provided include briefings from January 2025. The most recent mention is from January 29, 2025, where she held her first briefing. The user's current date is March 25, 2025, so any briefings after that would be relevant. However, the search results don't include any information beyond January 2025. \n\nNext, looking at the existing briefings, in the January 28, 2025 briefing (source [1]), Leavitt was asked about the OMB memo and federal grants. In her response, she mentioned \"Carney\" when a reporter asked a follow-up question. The transcript shows: \"Q But on indirect assistance, Karoline \u2014 Q Thank you, Karoline. Q \u2014 if it\u2019s going to another organization and then trickling down? MS. LEAVITT: Direct assistance that is in the hands of the American people will not be impacted. Again, as I said to Peter, we will continue to provide that list as it comes to fruition. But OMB right now is focused on analyzing the federal government\u2019s spending, which is exactly what the American people elected President Trump to do. (Cross-talk.) Q Thank you, Karoline. Q And one question on immigration, Karoline. On immigration. Q Thank you, Karo- \u2014 Q Of the 3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office, can you just tell us the numbers? How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally. MS. LEAVITT: All of them, because they illegally broke our nation\u2019s laws, and, therefore, they are criminals, as far as this administration goes. I know the last administration didn\u2019t see it that way, so it\u2019s a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal. But that\u2019s exactly what they are. Jacqui.... There\u2019s also a case that went before the Supreme Court in 2020: ~~Scaila~~ [Seila] Law LLC, v. the Customs \u2014 the [Consumer Financial Protection] Bureau ~~Protection~~. I would advise you to look at that case, and that\u2019s the legality that this White House has rested on.\" \n\nWait, in the transcript from source [1], there's a mention of \"Carney\" in the question from a reporter: \"Q But on indirect assistance, Karoline \u2014 Q Thank you, Karoline. Q \u2014 if it\u2019s going to another organization and then trickling down?\" But that's the reporter's question, not Leavitt's statement. Wait, no, looking again, the exact mention is in source [9], which is an article from O'Dwyer's PR. It states: \"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt commits a rookie mistake ... Mark Carney Democrats sure could use a guy like Canada's new leader ...\" However, this seems to be part of the article's content, not a transcript of Leavitt's briefing. \n\nWait, in source [1], the transcript shows that a reporter named \"Carney\" is present. For example, \"Q And, Karoline, you say \u201crestore\u201d U.S. dominance. Is there fear that the U.S. either is falling or has fallen behind? And how would the president make sure the U.S. stays ahead? MS. LEAVITT: No. The president is confident that we will restore American dominance in AI. Matt. Q Yeah. So, Karoline, first off, thank you to you and President Trump for actually giving voices to new media outlets that represent millions and millions of Americans. The thing I would add \u2014 the \u2014 I\u2019ve got a two-part question for you. The first is just: Can you expand upon what steps the White House is going to take to bring more voices, not less \u2014 which is what our founder, Andrew Breitbart, believed in \u2014 into this room, where they rightly belong?... And I will say it\u2019s very easy to speak truth from this podium when you have a president who is implementing policies that are wildly popular with the American people, and that\u2019s exactly what this administration is doing. It\u2019s correcting the lies and the wrongs of the past four years, many of the lies that have been told to your faces in this very briefing room. I will not do that. But since you brought up truth, Zeke, I would like to point out, while I vow to provide the truth from this podium, we ask that all of you in this room hold yourselves to that same standard. We know for a fact there have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets in this country about this president, about his family, and we will not accept that. We will call you out when we feel that your reporting is wrong or there is misinformation about this White House. So, yes, I will hold myself to the truth, and I expect everyone in this room to do the same. Q And, Karoline, just on a substantive question. Yesterday, the White House Office of Management and Budget directed an across-the-board freeze with \u2014 with some exceptions for individual assistance. We understand just federal grants. MS. LEAVITT: Right.... Q But on indirect assistance, Karoline \u2014 Q Thank you, Karoline. Q \u2014 if it\u2019s going to another organization and then trickling down? MS. LEAVITT: Direct assistance that is in the hands of the American people will not be impacted. Again, as I said to Peter, we will continue to provide that list as it comes to fruition.

Q So, you\u2019re confident that if they bring lawsuits against you \u2014 those prosecutors who were fired \u2014 that \u2014 that they will succeed? MS. LEAVITT: We will win in court, yes. Q And did he personally direct this, given they worked on the classified documents investigation and the election interference investigation? MS. LEAVITT: This was a memo that went out by the Presidential Personnel Office, and the president is the leader of this White House. So, yes. Q So, it did come from him? MS. LEAVITT: Yes, it came from this White House. (Cross-talk.) Q Karoline. MS. LEAVITT: Sir. Q Thank you. Congrats on your first day behind the podium. MS. LEAVITT: Thank you. Q President Trump ended funding for UNRWA and also designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization. MS. LEAVITT: That\u2019s right. Q Both were decisions that the previous administration had reversed. So, here\u2019s my question: Will there be an investigation into who gave the previous administration this terrible advice?\"\n\nWait, in this transcript, there's a mention of \"Carney\" in the context of a reporter's name. For example, \"Q And, Karoline, you say \u201crestore\u201d U.S. dominance. Is there fear that the U.S. either is falling or has fallen behind?

So, here\u2019s my question: Will there be an investigation into who gave the previous administration this terrible advice?\"\n\nWait, in the transcript from source [1], there's a mention of \"Carney\" in the context of a reporter's name. For example, \"Q And, Karoline, you say \u201crestore\u201d U.S. dominance. Is there fear that the U.S. either is falling or has fallen behind? And how would the president make sure the U.S. stays ahead? MS. LEAVITT: No. The president is confident that we will restore American dominance in AI. Matt. Q Yeah. So, Karoline, first off, thank you to you and President Trump for actually giving voices to new media outlets that represent millions and millions of Americans. The thing I would add \u2014 the \u2014 I\u2019ve got a two-part question for you. The first is just: Can you expand upon what steps the White House is going to take to bring more voices, not less \u2014 which is what our founder, Andrew Breitbart, believed in \u2014 into this room, where they rightly belong?... And I will say it\u2019s very easy to speak truth from this podium when you have a president who is implementing policies that are wildly popular with the American people, and that\u2019s exactly what this administration is doing. It\u2019s correcting the lies and the wrongs of the past four years, many of the lies that have been told to your faces in this very briefing room. I will not do that. But since you brought up truth, Zeke, I would like to point out, while I vow to provide the truth from this podium, we ask that all of you in this room hold yourselves to that same standard. We know for a fact there have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets in this country about this president, about his family, and we will not accept that. We will call you out when we feel that your reporting is wrong or there is misinformation about this White House. So, yes, I will hold myself to the truth, and I expect everyone in this room to do the same. Q And, Karoline, just on a substantive question. Yesterday, the White House Office of Management and Budget directed an across-the-board freeze with \u2014 with some exceptions for individual assistance. We understand just federal grants. MS. LEAVITT: Right.... Q But on indirect assistance, Karoline \u2014 Q Thank you, Karoline. Q \u2014 if it\u2019s going to another organization and then trickling down? MS. LEAVITT: Direct assistance that is in the hands of the American people will not be impacted. Again, as I said to Peter, we will continue to provide that list as it comes to fruition. But OMB right now is focused on analyzing the federal government\u2019s spending, which is exactly what the American people elected President Trump to do. (Cross-talk.) Q Thank you, Karoline. Q And one question on immigration, Karoline. On immigration. Q Thank you, Karo- \u2014 Q Of the 3,500 arrests ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office, can you just tell us the numbers? How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally. MS. LEAVITT: All of them, because they illegally broke our nation\u2019s laws, and, therefore, they are criminals, as far as this administration goes. I know the last administration didn\u2019t see it that way, so it\u2019s a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal. But that\u2019s exactly what they are. Jacqui.... There\u2019s also a case that went before the Supreme Court in 2020: ~~Scaila~~ [Seila] Law LLC, v. the Customs \u2014 the [Consumer Financial Protection] Bureau ~~Protection~~. I would advise you to look at that case, and that\u2019s the legality that this White House has rested on. Q So, you\u2019re confident that if they bring lawsuits against you \u2014 those prosecutors who were fired \u2014 that \u2014 that they will succeed? MS. LEAVITT: We will win in court, yes. Q And did he personally direct this, given they worked on the classified documents investigation and the election interference investigation? MS. LEAVITT: This was a memo that went out by the Presidential Personnel Office, and the president is the leader of this White House. So, yes. Q So, it did come from him? MS. LEAVITT: Yes, it came from this White House. (Cross-talk.) Q Karoline. MS. LEAVITT: Sir. Q Thank you. Congrats on your first day behind the podium. MS. LEAVITT: Thank you. Q President Trump ended funding for UNRWA and also designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization. MS. LEAVITT: That\u2019s right. Q Both were decisions that the previous administration had reversed. So, here\u2019s my question: Will there be an investigation into who gave the previous administration this terrible advice?\"\n\nWait, in this transcript, there's a mention of \"Carney\" in the context of a reporter's name. For example, \"Matt. Q Yeah. So, Karoline, first off, thank you to you and President Trump for actually giving voices to new media outlets that represent millions and millions of Americans.\" The reporter named Matt might be Matt Carney, but the transcript doesn't specify. However, in source [9], there's a mention of \"Mark Carney\" in the article, but that's part of the article's text, not Leavitt's statement. \n\nLooking at source [5], the Britannica entry mentions that Leavitt succeeded Jay Carney as press secretary. However, in the provided search results, there's no indication that Leavitt mentioned \"Carney\" in her briefings. The key point is whether she used the term \"Carney\" in any of her briefings after March 25, 2025. Since the latest briefing mentioned in the search results is from January 2025, and the current date is March 25, 2025, there's no information on briefings after that. \n\nThe query's deadline is December 31, 2025, so future briefings could occur. However, based on the available data up to March 25, 2025, there's no evidence that Leavitt has said \"Carney\" in any briefing after that date. The user is asking about the next briefing she participates in after March 25, 2025. Since the search results don't include any briefings after January 2025, we can't confirm if she said \"Carney\" in any subsequent briefings. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". However, given that Leavitt is currently the press secretary and has been holding briefings, it's likely she will hold more. But without specific information post-March 25, we can't verify if \"Carney\" was mentioned. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information, there's no confirmed instance of Leavitt saying \"Carney\" in a briefing after March 25, 2025. However, the user's query is about the next briefing she participates in after the current date. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the search results don't cover beyond January 2025, we have to assume that the next briefing hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, the event is scheduled for a future date, and according to the personalization instructions, if the event is in the future, the recommendation is p4. However, the resolution conditions specify that if the event hasn't happened by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). But the user is asking about the next briefing, which is a future event. \n\nWait, the query's resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, which is a future event. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, the event is in the future. According to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation is p4. However, the ancillary data specifies that if the event doesn't happen by the deadline, it's p1. But the user is asking about the next briefing, which is a future event. Therefore, since the event hasn't occurred yet and is in the future, the recommendation should be p4. However, the personalization instructions state: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" \n\nBut the query's resolution conditions have a deadline. However, the user's current timestamp is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing is in the future. Therefore, according to the rules, the recommendation should be p4. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions override this? Wait, the personalization instructions say to follow the ancillary data's resolution conditions. The ancillary data says if the event hasn't happened by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, which is a future event. Since the next briefing is after March 25, 2025, but before December 31, 2025, and we don't have information on whether it has occurred yet, the answer depends on whether the next briefing has happened. \n\nBut the current date is March 25, 2025, and the search results don't include any briefings after January 2025. Therefore, the next briefing after March 25, 2025, hasn't occurred yet. Hence, the event is in the future, and according to the personalization rules, the recommendation is p4. However, the resolution conditions state that if the event doesn't happen by the deadline, it's p1. But the user is asking about the next briefing, which is a specific event. If that specific event hasn't occurred yet, then the answer is p4. However, if the next briefing is scheduled but hasn't happened yet, it's still future. \n\nBut the user's query is about whether she will say \"Carney\" in the next briefing. Since the next briefing is a future event, and we can't predict the future, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the personalization instructions say to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since there's no information on the next briefing, and it's a future event, the recommendation is p4. \n\nWait, but the personalization instructions also state: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the event (the next briefing) is in the future relative to the current date (March 25, 2025). Therefore, since it's a future event, the recommendation is p4. However, the resolution conditions have a deadline. But the user is asking about the next briefing, not all possible briefings until the deadline. If the next briefing is after March 25 but before the deadline, and it hasn't happened yet, then it's a future event. Therefore, the answer is p4. \n\nBut wait, the user's query is about the next briefing she participates in. If that briefing hasn't occurred by the current date (March 25, 2025), then it's a future event, and the recommendation is p4. However, if the next briefing has already occurred but isn't covered in the search results, then we need to check. But the search results only go up to January 2025. Therefore, the next briefing after March 25, 2025, is in the future, and the recommendation is p4. \n\nHowever, the personalization instructions also mention: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user's query doesn't include any URLs, so we rely on the provided search results. The search results don't include any briefings after January 2025, so there's no information on whether \"Carney\" was mentioned in briefings after March 25, 2025. Therefore, the event is in the future, and the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

This decision aligns with the system prompt instructions that require the AI to return p4 if the event in question has not occurred yet or is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp.\n\nThe response is thorough in its exploration of available data, checking for any briefings after March 25, 2025, and confirming that there are no records of such briefings up to the current date. It correctly identifies that the next briefing, which is the subject of the query, is a future event as of the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). Therefore, it cannot definitively resolve whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Carney\" during that briefing.\n\nHowever, according to the critical rule for the first attempt where the recommendation is p4, a retry is mandatory. This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining relevant information are exhausted before settling on p4 as a final recommendation. The response could potentially be improved by employing more advanced or updated search strategies or accessing more current or comprehensive data sources in a subsequent attempt.\n\nGiven these considerations, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"Mandatory retry for first attempt p4 to exhaust all possible information sources.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is logically sound and adheres to the instructions, but a retry is required to ensure all data avenues are explored.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please use updated or more comprehensive data sources to verify if any briefings by Karoline Leavitt have occurred after March 25, 2025, or if there are any scheduled briefings before December 31, 2025.\"\n}\n```",

There's also a mention of a briefing on March 20, 2025, where she was asked about Trump and Canadian PM Carney [5]. Wait, the current date is March 25, 2025, so the March 20 briefing is in the past. The user is asking about the *next* briefing after March 25. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a March 25, 2025 article from The Daily Beast [7] discussing her recent statements, but no mention of a future briefing. The latest briefing mentioned is March 11, 2025 [12], and March 20, 2025 [5]. Since the current date is March 25, the next briefing would be after that. However, none of the search results indicate any scheduled briefings after March 25. \n\nThe user's query includes a deadline of December 31, 2025. If no briefing occurs by then, the market resolves to \"No\". But we need to check if there's any information about future briefings. The search results don't show any scheduled briefings beyond March 25. Additionally, there's no indication that Leavitt has ceased being Press Secretary. \n\nHowever, in the March 20 briefing [5], she was asked about Carney, and in the March 11 briefing [12], she mentioned Carney in the context of tariffs. But those are past events. The user is asking about the *next* briefing. Since there's no information on upcoming briefings, and the deadline is months away, we can't confirm if she will say \"Carney\" in a future briefing. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking for the next briefing, whenever that may be. Without information on future briefings, and given that the term \"Carney\" (referring to the Canadian PM) has been part of recent discussions, there's a possibility she might mention him again. However, without confirmation of a scheduled briefing, we can't be certain. \n\nWait, the ancillary data says if no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to \"No\". But the user's question is whether she will say \"Carney\" in the next briefing whenever it occurs. If a briefing happens before the deadline and she says \"Carney\", it's \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\". Since there's no info on future briefings, but the deadline is in the future, we can't definitively say \"No\" yet. However, the market requires a resolution based on current information. \n\nBut according to the rules, if the event (the next briefing) hasn't occurred yet and the deadline is in the future, the resolution should be p4. Wait, no, the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the market's own resolution conditions override that? Wait, the user's ancillary data specifies that if no briefing happens by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". So the market's resolution is based on whether the event occurs and she says the term. Since the event (next briefing) is in the future as of March 25, and we don't know if it will happen before December 31, but the market will resolve to \"No\" only if no briefing occurs by then. However, the user is asking to resolve now based on available information. \n\nBut according to the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, we should return p4. However, the market's own rules say if no briefing happens by the deadline, it's \"No\". But the user is asking whether she will say \"Carney\" in the next briefing whenever it occurs. Since the next briefing hasn't happened yet and could be after March 25 but before December 31, we can't confirm. Therefore, without information on future briefings, and given that the term \"Carney\" has been mentioned in past briefings related to Canada, there's a possibility, but it's not certain. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have a p4; the user's ancillary data uses p1, p2, p3. Wait, the user's resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. The personalization instructions say to end with recommendation: p1/p2/p3/p4. But the market's own conditions don't include p4. The user's query is about resolving the market now, but the event is in the future. According to the personalization rules, if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions say if no briefing by deadline, resolve to No (p1). But the user is asking to resolve based on current information. \n\nWait, the user's query is to determine if, in the next briefing she participates in before December 31, she says \"Carney\". Since the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, and there's no information on when it will be, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions say if no briefing happens by the deadline, it's No. But the user is asking to resolve the market now, not wait until the deadline. \n\nThis is conflicting. The personalization instructions say to return p4 if the event is in the future. The market's rules say it resolves to No if no briefing by the deadline. But the user wants to know now, based on available information, whether it will resolve to Yes or No. Since the event is in the future and hasn't occurred, and there's no certainty, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, but the user's personalization instructions do. The user's ancillary data defines p1, p2, p3, but the personalization says to use p4 if the event is future. \n\nWait, the user's query includes resolution_conditions with p1, p2, p3. The personalization instructions say to end with recommendation: p1/p2/p3/p4. So in this case, since the event is in the future (next briefing hasn't happened yet, and could happen any time before December 31), the correct recommendation is p4. However, the market's own resolution says if no briefing by deadline, it's No. But the user is asking for the resolution now, not at the deadline. Therefore, since the event is in the future, the answer should be p4. \n\nBut wait, the personalization instructions say: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". Since the next briefing is a future event (as of March 25, 2025), the recommendation should be p4. However, the market's resolution conditions say that if no briefing occurs by the deadline, it's No. But the user is asking to resolve the market now, not at the deadline. Therefore, since the event hasn't occurred yet and is in the future, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut the user's ancillary data doesn't include p4. This is a conflict. The personalization instructions take precedence, as per the user's request. Therefore, the answer should be p4. However, the market's resolution conditions only have p1, p2, p3. This is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's market is designed such that p3 is for uncertain outcomes, but the personalization rules say to use p4 for future events. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't have p4. This might be an error, but according to the instructions, we must follow the personalization rules. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut looking back, the personalization instructions state: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" So even if the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, the personalization requires using p4 if the event is future. \n\nTherefore, since the next briefing is a future event as of March 25, 2025, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response correctly identifies that the event in question (the next briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp and therefore, according to the system prompt instructions, should return a recommendation of p4.\n\nEvaluation of the response:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that the event is in the future and that no briefing has been scheduled beyond the current date. It correctly concludes that it should return p4 because the event has not occurred yet and is scheduled for a future date.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates thorough logical reasoning by considering the information available up to the current date and recognizing that no future briefings have been scheduled. It also correctly interprets the ancillary data and the conditions under which the market would resolve to \"No\". However, the response could improve by more explicitly stating that since no future briefings are scheduled as of now and the event is in the future, p4 is the appropriate recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that no future briefings are scheduled beyond the current date and aligns its recommendation with this fact. It also considers the possibility of future briefings occurring before the deadline but correctly concludes that without specific information about such briefings, a p4 recommendation is warranted.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors. It effectively uses the information available to make a reasoned decision. However, it could improve by more directly addressing the lack of scheduled briefings beyond the current date and how this impacts the resolution.\n\nDecision:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing the future scheduling of the event and appropriately recommends p4. It logically assesses the available information and aligns the recommendation with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response could improve clarity by more explicitly stating the absence of scheduled briefings beyond the current date and directly linking this to the recommendation of p4.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThe response is satisfactory as it adheres to the instructions, logically processes the information, and makes an appropriate recommendation based on the current facts.",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
