        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"plant\" during his event with the Governor of Louisiana on March 24, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term \"plant\" was used in any form, including plural or possessive, but not other variations. Compound words count if they include \"plant\" as a standalone part.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The most relevant sources here are [2], [5], [6], and maybe others. Let's look at each one.\n\nLooking at source [2], it's a video titled \"Trump Shocks Elon Musk With Rival Firm's Huge Announcement\" from March 25, 2025. The summary mentions President Trump celebrating a $5.8 billion steel production facility in Louisiana. The transcript from the video includes Trump saying, \"Hyundai announced at the White House that it would build a $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana.\" Here, the word \"plant\" is used directly in reference to the steel facility. That's a clear instance of the term being used.\n\nSource [6] is a YouTube video transcript of the same event. The transcript includes Trump stating, \"louisiana will be home to Hyundai's first steel mill in the United States which will create 1,300 American jobs...\" Wait, here he says \"steel mill,\" not \"plant.\" But earlier in the transcript, there's a mention of \"steel plant\" when describing the investment. Wait, the transcript says, \"Hyundai's first steel mill\" but the article summary in [2] says \"steel plant.\" Need to check if \"plant\" was actually used in the speech.\n\nWait, the user provided a transcript snippet in [6] that says: \"Hyundai's first steel mill in the United States which will create 1,300 American jobs...\" So \"mill\" is used here. But in the summary from [2], it's mentioned as a \"steel plant.\" There might be a discrepancy. However, the video's transcript in [6] also includes Trump saying, \"the 1700 acre Donaldsonville plant will produce almost 3 million metric tons of steel a year.\" Here, \"plant\" is explicitly used. So in the actual speech, Trump did say \"plant\" when referring to the facility.\n\nAdditionally, in source [5], which is a 2019 rally in Louisiana, Trump talks about energy production and manufacturing, but that's from a past event and not the one on March 24, 2025. The key sources are [2] and [6], both referring to the 2025 event. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that the event in question is the one on March 24, 2025, with the Governor of Louisiana. The search results confirm that during this event, Trump announced the steel plant, using the exact word \"plant.\" Even though \"mill\" is also used, the term \"plant\" is clearly stated in the context of the facility being built. \n\nTherefore, according to the resolution conditions, since \"plant\" was used during the event, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). There's no ambiguity here as the term was explicitly mentioned in the relevant event's transcript.\n</think>\n\nDuring the March 24, 2025, event with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, Donald Trump explicitly used the word \"plant\" while announcing Hyundai's $5.8 billion steel production facility in Donaldsonville, Louisiana. In the official remarks, Trump stated: **\"the 1700 acre Donaldsonville plant will produce almost 3 million metric tons of steel a year\"** [2][6]. This direct usage of \"plant\" satisfies the market's resolution criteria, as the term was spoken in its singular form during the scheduled event.  \n\nThe context confirms this was part of the planned remarks about economic investments, with no indication of cancellation or deviation from the event's scope. While Trump also used \"steel mill\" synonymously [6], the critical term \"plant\" was unequivocally uttered.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that Donald Trump used the word \"plant\" during the event with the Governor of Louisiana on March 24, 2025. The response correctly adheres to the user prompt's requirement that any usage of the term \"plant,\" including in compound words, counts toward the resolution of the market. The response also correctly identifies that the event was not canceled and that the term was used within the context of the specified event.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a thorough analysis by checking multiple sources ([2] and [6]) to confirm the usage of the term \"plant.\" It addresses potential discrepancies between the terms \"plant\" and \"mill\" and resolves these by confirming the use of \"plant\" in the speech. The reasoning is logically structured and leads to a clear conclusion based on the evidence provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and that the term \"plant\" was used during the event. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) is directly aligned with the facts verified from the sources and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not contain any missing information relevant to the resolution of the query. It effectively uses the provided sources to substantiate its findings.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with the established facts and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the use of the term 'plant' during the specified event, adheres to the user prompt instructions, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm the usage of the term and resolves potential discrepancies in terminology usage. It provides a clear and logical analysis leading to an accurate recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934529 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:28:49 UTC",
