The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 23 has already happened. No need to worry about future dates here.\n\nNext, looking at the search results. All sources [1] through [8] report that the Florida Panthers won the game 4-3 in a shootout. The game wasn't postponed or canceled. The AP recap mentions the shootout win, and multiple sources confirm the Panthers' victory. \n\nThe resolution conditions state a Panthers win resolves to p1. Since the game occurred and the Panthers won, the recommendation should be p1. No conflicting information in the sources, so no ambiguity. All sources align on the outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Florida Panthers on March 23, 2025, concluded with a **4-3 shootout victory for the Florida Panthers**[1][2][3][4][7]. The Panthers overcame a 3-1 deficit, tying the game in the third period with Anton Lundell's goal[1][4][7], and secured the win in the shootout after Aleksander Barkov scored and Sergei Bobrovsky stopped all three Penguins attempts[1][2][3][4]. \n\nAccording to the ancillary data, the market resolves to **\"Panthers\" (p1)** when Florida wins.

Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:\n   - The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Florida Panthers on March 23, 2025) has already occurred, as the current date is March 25, 2025.\n   - The response uses verified facts from reliable sources to confirm that the Florida Panthers won the game. This is in line with the system's requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness:\n   - The response logically follows the conditions set in the user prompt for resolving the market: Panthers win corresponds to p1.\n   - It confirms that the game was not postponed or canceled, which aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The response verifies the occurrence of the event and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the recommendation is based on a well-supported and verified event outcome.\n   - The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the ancillary data conditions provided (Panthers win leads to p1).\n\n4. Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response:\n   - There is no indication of missing information or bias. The response does not show any errors in processing the user prompt or in deriving the outcome based on the provided information.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906369 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:39:29 UTC",
