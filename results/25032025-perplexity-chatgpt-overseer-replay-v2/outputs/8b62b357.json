The ancillary data specifies that if St. John's wins, it's p1; Marquette, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 26, 2025, so the game on March 14 is definitely in the past. No issues there.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome of the game. Looking at the search results, several sources confirm the result. Source [2] is a CBS Sports recap titled \"Ejiofor powers No. 6 St. John's past No. 25 Marquette 79-63 into 1st Big East final since 2000.\" The article states that St. John's won 79-63. Source [5] from ESPN also lists the final score as St. John's 79-63 Marquette. Additionally, source [3] is a YouTube video of the game highlights with the title indicating St. John's victory, and source [6] another video confirming the same result. \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game took place on March 14. The final score is clear, with St. John's winning by a significant margin. There's no mention of any cancellations or postponements in any of the sources. \n\nSince the event occurred, and the outcome is verified by multiple reliable sources (ESPN, CBS Sports, official team websites), the resolution should be p1 corresponding to St. John's win. No conflicting information exists in the provided search results. All evidence points to a definitive St. John's victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Marquette vs. St. John's men's college basketball game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 6:30 PM ET concluded with **St. John's defeating Marquette 79-63** in the Big East Tournament semifinals[2][5]. This outcome was verified through multiple sources, including official game recaps and video highlights:\n\n- **St. John's dominated** after overcoming an early 15-point deficit, led by Zuby Ejiofor's career-high 33 points and nine rebounds[2][5].\n- The Red Storm advanced to their first Big East championship game since 2000, while Marquette's season shifted focus to the NCAA Tournament[2][5].\n- The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by play-by-play details and postgame analysis[2][3][5][6].\n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1 (St. John's)**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event (Marquette vs. St. John's game) occurred on March 14, 2025, and that the current date is March 26, 2025, confirming the event is in the past. The response correctly identifies the winner of the game as St. John's with a score of 79-63, based on multiple reliable sources including CBS Sports and ESPN. This adheres to the instruction to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks whether the event has occurred and verifies the outcome using multiple sources. It confirms that the game was neither postponed nor canceled, which aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution. The reasoning is complete as it covers all possible outcomes (win, postponement, cancellation) and confirms the actual outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through credible sources and aligns the recommendation (p1 for St. John's win) with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. This ensures that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not omit any crucial information necessary for resolution. It effectively uses the sources mentioned to confirm the event details and outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985344 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:35:44 UTC"
