The ancillary data specifies that if the Nets win, it's p2 (Nets), Pacers win is p1 (Pacers), postponed stays open, and canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 20) is in the past. Next, I need to confirm the result. Looking at the search results, multiple sources like [1], [5], [7], [11], [13], and [14] mention the Pacers defeating the Nets 105-99 in overtime on March 20. The detailed box scores and highlights from these sources confirm the Pacers' victory. \n\nSince the game was played and the Pacers won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Indiana Pacers defeated the Brooklyn Nets 105-99 in overtime on March 20, 2025, as confirmed by multiple game recaps and box scores[1][5][11][14]. Bennedict Mathurin led the Pacers with 28 points and 16 rebounds, while Myles Turner contributed 23 points and 10 rebounds[1][11]. The Nets' D'Angelo Russell scored a team-high 22 points in the loss[1].\n\nThis outcome occurred on the scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources. The game was completed under normal NBA regulations with overtime played to determine the winner[1][5][14]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event's outcome through multiple sources and aligning the resolution recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm it is a past event. It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event through reliable sources, confirming the Pacers' victory. The reasoning is sound, and the response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, which mention the specific score and key players' performances. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Pacers win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928056 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:40:56 UTC",
