        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Israel\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on whether the term \"Israel\" was used, including plural or possessive forms, but not other forms. The press conference is the key event, not preceding meetings. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the word \"Israel\" during that presser. Let's look through the sources provided. \n\nLooking at source [14], which is a transcript of the meeting, Trump mentions Israel several times. For example, he says, \"we\u2019re working hard with Israel\" and refers to the hostages held by Hamas, which relates to Israel. Another part of the transcript has him discussing the situation in Gaza and the need to work with Israel. \n\nSource [11] also mentions Trump talking about Israel during the meeting. He refers to the events of October 7th, which are directly tied to Israel. Additionally, source [15] notes Trump's comments about working with Israel and the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which is connected to Israel. \n\nThe press conference included a Q&A session, as seen in the transcript where reporters ask questions. The resolution conditions state that Q&A sessions count, so any mentions there are valid. \n\nSince the term \"Israel\" was used multiple times in the press conference, the answer should be \"Yes\". The plural or possessive forms aren't an issue here because the exact term \"Israel\" was used. There's no indication the event was canceled, and the sources confirm the presser happened as scheduled. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\", which corresponds to p2.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided search results and analysis of the March 12, 2025 press conference between Donald Trump and Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin:\n\n**Key evidence shows Trump mentioned \"Israel\" multiple times during the event:**\n1. In the Oval Office transcript, Trump explicitly stated: *\"We\u2019re working hard with Israel\"* while discussing Middle East policy [14].\n2. He referenced Israel's security situation, saying: *\"Israel has faced significant challenges and has had to defend itself\"* [13].\n3. Trump discussed the October 7 attacks on Israel and hostage situations, stating: *\"I went to Kibbutz Be\u2019eri... it was a shocking thing to see\"* [14][15].\n\n**Contextual analysis:**\n- The press conference included a bilateral meeting and Q&A session, both covered in the resolution criteria\n- Multiple forms of \"Israel\" were used including direct references to the state and its policies\n- No evidence suggests the event was canceled or unaired\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by focusing on the specific event mentioned in the user prompt and verifying the occurrence and context of the event as specified.\n\nThe response provides a detailed analysis of the sources that confirm Trump's use of the term \"Israel\" during the press conference. It correctly identifies that the term was used in various contexts related to policy discussions and interactions with the media, which aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The response also correctly notes that the event was not canceled and was aired as scheduled, further supporting the resolution to \"Yes\" (p2).\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, with a clear linkage between the evidence presented and the conclusion reached. The response methodically checks the conditions laid out in the user prompt, such as the inclusion of Q&A sessions in the resolution criteria and the specific mention of the term \"Israel\" in various forms.\n\nThere are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The response does not introduce irrelevant information and stays focused on the event in question. It uses multiple sources to corroborate the facts, which enhances the reliability of the resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the facts established through the sources cited.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the user prompt and system instructions, providing a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the occurrence of the event and the use of the term 'Israel,' aligning well with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905538 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:25:38 UTC",
