The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of a college basketball game between UC Santa Barbara and CSU Northridge scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if UC Santa Barbara wins, the market resolves to them (p2), if CSU Northridge wins, it's p1, and if postponed or canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the game should have already happened. Let me look through the search results to find the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [1] from oddspedia.com states the match ended with CS Northridge 72 vs UC Santa Barbara 78. That's a win for UC Santa Barbara. Another source [4] from wtop.com confirms this with a headline saying UC Santa Barbara tops Cal State Northridge 78-72. Similarly, [9] from newuniversity.org and [13] from cbssports.com both report the same score, with UC Santa Barbara winning 78-72 in the Big West Conference Tournament quarterfinal on March 13. \n\nThere's also a box score in [11] from ESPN showing the final score as 78-72 in favor of UC Santa Barbara. Additionally, [7] and [12] reference the game on March 13, 2025, with the same outcome. \n\nI need to ensure that the event in question is the same as the one reported. The date and teams match exactly. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation; all point to the game being played as scheduled. Therefore, the market should resolve based on the actual outcome. Since UC Santa Barbara won, the resolution should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe UC Santa Barbara Gauchos defeated the CSU Northridge Matadors 78-72 in the Big West Conference Tournament quarterfinal on March 13, 2025[1][4][9][11][13]. The game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Stephan D. Swenson led UC Santa Barbara with 25 points, while Keonte Jones scored 19 for CSU Northridge[4][13]. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: UC Santa Barbara 78, CSU Northridge 72  \n- Venue: Lee's Family Forum in Henderson, NV  \n- UC Santa Barbara advanced to the semifinals against UC San Diego[4][9]  \n\nSince the game concluded with UC Santa Barbara's victory, the market resolves to **UC Santa Barbara** per the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923415 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:23:35 UTC"
