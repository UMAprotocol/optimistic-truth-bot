        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the St. Joseph's vs. Dayton game that was scheduled for March 14, 2025. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome of the game. Looking at the sources, result [3] from daytonflyers.com states that Dayton lost to Saint Joseph's 73-68 in overtime during the Atlantic 10 Tournament quarterfinal. Similarly, result [4] from the same site confirms the same score and outcome. Result [5] from the Dayton Daily News also mentions Dayton's loss, detailing how they blew a lead in the final minute and Saint Joseph's controlled the overtime. Additionally, result [7] from Fox Sports explicitly states that Dayton did not cover the spread because they needed to win by 2 points or more, but Saint Joseph's won outright.\n\nAll these sources agree that Saint Joseph's (St. Joseph's) won the game. The ancillary data specifies that if St. Joseph's wins, the market resolves to p2. Since the game was completed and not postponed or canceled, there's no need to consider p3. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2 corresponding to St. Joseph's victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Saint Joseph's (PA) Hawks defeated the Dayton Flyers 73-68 in overtime during the Atlantic 10 Tournament quarterfinal game on March 14, 2025. Despite Dayton leading 60-56 with 18 seconds remaining in regulation, Saint Joseph's forced overtime with four free throws in the final 18 seconds[3][4][5]. The Hawks then dominated the overtime period, outscoring Dayton 13-8 to secure the victory[3][4]. Official game reports from Dayton's athletics website and local media confirm Saint Joseph's as the winner[3][4][5][7].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has effectively adhered to the instructions provided in the system prompt and has accurately resolved the UMA optimistic oracle request based on the event's outcome. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (St. Joseph's vs. Dayton game) occurred on March 14, 2025, and the current date is March 25, 2025, confirming that the event is in the past. The AI used multiple reliable sources (daytonflyers.com, Dayton Daily News, Fox Sports) to verify the outcome of the game, which is that St. Joseph's won. This aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition that if St. Joseph's wins, the market resolves to p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with the verification of the event date, followed by a detailed search for the outcome using credible sources. It then correctly applies the ancillary data provided in the user prompt to reach a resolution recommendation. The response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query without unnecessary information.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI has verified the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the reliability of the information. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts as St. Joseph's victory directs the resolution to p2, as specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the UMA optimistic oracle request. Therefore, my decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verified the event's outcome using reliable sources and correctly applied the ancillary data to reach the appropriate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response was thorough and adhered strictly to the instructions, using verified facts to resolve the query accurately.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
