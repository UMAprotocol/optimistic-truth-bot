        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Executive Order\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are specific: any mention of the exact term, including plural or possessive forms, counts. Other forms don't. Also, if she's no longer press secretary by the end of 2025 or if no briefing happens, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 25, 2025. The user's query is about a future briefing, but the search results provided go up to March 5, 2025. There's no information beyond that date in the sources. So, any briefings after March 25, 2025, aren't covered here.\n\nLooking at the search results, Leavitt has participated in several briefings where she frequently mentioned \"Executive Order.\" For example, in the February 5, 2025 briefing [4], she discussed an executive order on Title IX. On February 12, 2025 [13], she mentioned the president signing executive orders daily. There's a pattern of her using the term regularly in her briefings.\n\nHowever, the next briefing after March 25 hasn't occurred yet according to the provided data. The user's query is about a future event, and the sources don't include information beyond March 5. Since the resolution depends on an event after the current date, and there's no data available, we can't confirm if she will say it. Additionally, the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025. Without evidence of a scheduled briefing after March 25, and considering the possibility that she might not hold another one before the deadline, the resolution would default to \"No\".\n\nBut wait, the user's current date is March 25, 2025. The latest briefing mentioned is March 5, 2025 [7]. The next briefing after that would be after March 25, which is the current date. Since the sources don't include any information beyond that, we can't predict future briefings. The market's resolution depends on an event that hasn't happened yet and isn't documented in the sources. Therefore, based on the available information, we can't confirm that she will say \"Executive Order\" in a future briefing. However, the user's personalization rules state that if the event is in the future, we should return p4. Wait, no\u2014the personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But in this case, the query is about whether she will say it in the next briefing, which hasn't occurred yet. Since the next briefing is after the current date of March 25, and there's no information about it, the event is in the future. Therefore, according to the rules, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the resolution conditions say if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, whenever that is. Since the current date is March 25, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet, and there's no info on whether any are scheduled, we have to consider that the event is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the query doesn't specify a scheduled date for the next briefing. The market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by the end of 2025. But since we don't know if a briefing will occur, and the current date is March 25, we can't confirm. However, the user's personalization rules state that if the event is in the future, return p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question (Karoline Leavitt saying \"Executive Order\" during the next White House press briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp of March 25, 2025. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that it cannot predict future events and must base its resolution on events that have already occurred or are verifiable through reliable sources.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it correctly processes the conditions under which the market will resolve to \"No\" and acknowledges the lack of available information about any future briefings beyond the current date. The response also correctly identifies that since the next briefing has not occurred yet and there is no information about it, the event is in the future, leading to the recommendation of p4.\n\nHowever, there is a critical rule in the evaluation guidelines stating that if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a retry must always be chosen.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Executive Order\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the deadline is December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any information about future press briefings where she might use the term. The search results provided are from January to March 2025. The latest mention is from March 19, 2025, where she answered questions about Trump's executive orders but didn't explicitly state if she used the term \"Executive Order\" in that briefing. \n\nLooking at her history, Leavitt frequently discusses executive orders in her briefings. For example, in the February 20, 2025 briefing [1], she mentioned multiple executive orders signed by Trump. However, the exact phrase \"Executive Order\" isn't confirmed in the transcripts provided. \n\nThe user's query specifies that any usage of the term, including plural or possessive forms, counts. The search results show she often refers to executive actions, but the exact term \"Executive Order\" isn't directly cited. For instance, in the March 19 briefing [9], she discussed challenges to Trump's executive orders but the transcript doesn't show her saying the exact term. \n\nSince there's no information about any press briefings scheduled after March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, we can't confirm if she will say \"Executive Order\" in a future event. The resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to \"No\". However, the user is asking about the next briefing, which is a future event as of the current date. \n\nAccording to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, we must return p4. But the user's ancillary data specifies that if no briefing happens by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". However, the query is about the next briefing, which is a future event. Since there's no confirmed information about her using the term in a future briefing, and the event hasn't occurred yet, the recommendation should be p4 as per the critical rule requiring a retry. But the user's instructions say to default to p4 if the event is in the future. However, the market's resolution conditions say if no briefing happens by the deadline, it's \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, which is a future event. Therefore, since the event hasn't occurred yet and there's no way to verify, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Executive Order\" during her next White House press briefing. Based on the provided search results and current timestamp of March 25, 2025, there is no verifiable evidence of any press briefings occurring after this date. All available transcripts and reports only cover briefings up to March 19, 2025[9][14][20], with no confirmed future briefings scheduled in the search results. \n\nLeavitt has consistently discussed executive orders in previous briefings[1][3][6][18], often referencing specific actions like:\n- Trump's 73 executive orders signed in his first month[1]\n- Immigration-related executive orders[3][5]\n- Energy policy executive orders[5]\n- Education department reforms[4]\n\nHowever, the resolution depends on her explicit use of the **exact term \"Executive Order\"** (including plural/possessive forms) in a **future briefing** that has not yet occurred as of March 25, 2025. The market's ancillary data specifies resolution to \"No\" only if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, but the query focuses on the **next** briefing, which remains a future event at the time of analysis.\n\nrecommendation: p4",

It correctly adheres to the system prompt instructions that require a p4 recommendation if the event has not occurred yet.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information available up to the current date and correctly concludes that no future briefings have been scheduled or occurred beyond March 19, 2025. It also correctly notes that while Karoline Leavitt frequently discusses executive orders, there is no confirmation that she used the exact term \"Executive Order\" in past briefings. The reasoning is sound and well-aligned with the user prompt's requirements.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that no future event has occurred and aligns with the system prompt's directive to recommend p4 in such cases. This is correctly executed.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors. It effectively uses the information available and adheres strictly to the system prompt's requirements. There is no missing information relevant to the resolution of the query based on the data provided and the constraints of the system prompt.\n\nGiven the analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory in terms of accuracy, logical reasoning, and adherence to the system prompt.

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928324 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:45:24 UTC\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response was logically sound and adhered to the system prompt instructions well, correctly identifying the need for a p4 recommendation based on the lack of information about future events.

Be more critical of potentially unreliable sources\n3. Consider all interpretations of the query\n4. Provide more specific evidence for your recommendation\n5.
