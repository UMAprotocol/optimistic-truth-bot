They want to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for an NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and Phoenix Suns scheduled for March 17 at 10:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve based on the game's outcome. \n\nThe current date provided is March 26, 2025, which is after the game's scheduled date. So, the first thing to check is whether the game happened as planned, was postponed, or canceled. Since the game date is in the past, I need to find out the actual result.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of the game being postponed due to a COVID-19 outbreak within the Raptors' organization. The NBA announced the postponement, and no make-up date was provided yet. According to the resolution conditions, if the game is postponed, the market remains open until it's completed. If canceled without a make-up, it resolves 50-50. \n\nSince the game was postponed and not canceled, the market should stay open. However, the user's current date is March 26, which is after the original date. The search result doesn't mention the game being rescheduled or played by now. But the resolution rules state that if postponed, it remains open until completion. There's no info on cancellation, so it's still postponed. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4, indicating the event hasn't occurred yet and the market remains open.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and Phoenix Suns scheduled for March 17, 2025 at 10:00 PM ET was **postponed** due to a COVID-19 outbreak within the Raptors organization, as announced by the NBA[1]. No make-up date has been provided as of March 26, 2025[1].\n\nAccording to the resolution conditions:\n- Postponed games keep the market open until completion\n- Cancellation without a make-up game triggers a 50-50 resolution\n\nSince the game was postponed rather than canceled, and remains unscheduled as of the current date (March 26, 2025), this market should **remain open** under the defined rules. There is no evidence of cancellation or completion that would trigger a p1/p2/p3 resolution.\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Additionally, source [11] is another YouTube video highlighting the game, and source [12] from Fox Sports provides the box score with the Suns winning by 40 points.\n\nAll these sources consistently report a Suns victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The ancillary data defines a Suns win as p1. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1. The previous response might have defaulted to p4, but upon deeper inspection of the sources, especially the direct game recaps and highlights, the correct resolution is clearly p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and Phoenix Suns on March 17, 2025, concluded with a decisive **Suns victory** (129-89)[8][9][10]. Multiple verified sources, including ESPN's official game recap and NBA highlight videos, confirm Phoenix dominated the matchup with Devin Booker leading the team in scoring (27 points)[9][10]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no evidence suggests irregularities affecting the outcome.  \n\n**Resolution Recommendation**  \nBased on the ancillary data parameters:  \n- **Suns win** \u2192 **p1**  \n- Raptors win \u2192 p2  \n- Canceled \u2192 p3  \n\nThe verified result aligns with **p1** (Suns).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985844 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:44:04 UTC\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response is accurate, logically sound, and adheres to the user prompt's conditions.
