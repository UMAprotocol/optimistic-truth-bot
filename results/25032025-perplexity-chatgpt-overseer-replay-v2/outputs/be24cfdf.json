        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she uses those exact terms, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the deadline is December 31, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after March 25 but before the deadline. The search results mention briefings up to March 2025, like the one on March 19 and 25. The latest mention is a briefing on March 25 where she discussed Ukraine and mineral rights, but there's no transcript provided. However, the user's query is about the \"next\" briefing after March 25. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of a briefing on March 25, 2025, in result [15], but the details are about Ukraine. The next briefing after that isn't specified in the provided results. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the user is asking about the next briefing, I need to determine if there's any upcoming briefing before the deadline. \n\nThe ancillary data states that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". However, based on past frequency, Leavitt has been holding regular briefings, so it's likely there will be more. But without explicit information on future schedules, it's uncertain. \n\nNext, I need to assess Leavitt's past usage of \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\". From the search results, especially [1], [2], [5], [6], she frequently discusses AI in the context of U.S.-China competition, DeepSeek, and policy. For example, in [6], she mentions \"American AI dominance\" multiple times. This indicates a pattern where AI is a common topic in her briefings.\n\nHowever, the exact terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" must be used. In the transcripts provided, she uses \"AI\" explicitly, such as in [6]: \"restore American AI dominance\" and \"AI and crypto czar\". This shows she does use the term \"AI\" in her briefings.\n\nConsidering the resolution conditions, if the next briefing occurs and she mentions \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\", it's p2. Given her history of discussing AI-related topics and using the term, it's probable she will mention it again. However, without confirmation of the next briefing's occurrence and content, there's a slight uncertainty. But since the user is asking about the next briefing she participates in, and assuming one happens before the deadline, the likelihood leans towards \"Yes\".\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during her next White House press briefing is problematic and does not adhere to the system prompt instructions for several reasons:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The system prompt clearly states that the AI's primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. The response from Perplexity AI attempts to predict whether Karoline Leavitt will mention \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" in a future briefing, which is beyond its scope as defined by the prompt. The response should have recognized that the event is scheduled for a future date and returned a recommendation of p4, indicating that the request cannot be resolved at this time.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response engages in speculative reasoning about the likelihood of future briefings and the probability of Leavitt using specific terms based on past behavior. This approach is contrary to the directive to base responses solely on concrete evidence and established facts about events that have already occurred.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response fails to verify that the event (the next briefing) has occurred and instead bases its recommendation on assumptions and patterns from past events. This does not align with the requirement to verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response contains a significant error by not defaulting to p4 given that the event is scheduled for the future. There is also a bias towards assuming continuity in Leavitt's behavior without concrete evidence from the specific future event in question.\n\nGiven these issues, the response from Perplexity AI is not satisfactory and needs improvement. The correct approach, according to the system prompt instructions, would be to recognize that the event is in the future and that a prediction cannot be made at this time.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly attempts to predict a future event rather than stating it cannot be resolved at this time.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should adhere to the system prompt's directive to analyze only past events and established facts.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt said \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during her next White House press briefing after March 25, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if she uses either term, considering pluralization or possessive forms, but not other variations. If no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer Press Secretary, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to see if there are any press briefings by Leavitt after March 25, 2025. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the next briefing would be after this date. However, all the search results are from before March 25, 2025. The latest one is from February 25, 2025 (source [1]), and others are from January and February 2025. There's no information about any briefings after March 25. \n\nSince the user's query is about a future event (a briefing after March 25, 2025), and the provided sources don't cover any events beyond that date, there's no verifiable information to confirm whether she used the terms. According to the system prompt's personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, the recommendation should be p4. However, the resolution conditions here are p1 (No), p2 (Yes), p3 (50-50). Wait, the user's resolution_conditions have p1 as No, p2 as Yes, p3 as 0.5. But the system's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the user's ancillary data says if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to No (p1). But since the event hasn't occurred yet as of the current date (March 25, 2025), and there's no information on future briefings, the correct recommendation would be p4. Wait, but the user's resolution conditions don't include p4. The system prompt says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. The user's ancillary data defines p1 as No, p2 as Yes, p3 as 0.5. However, the system's personalization rules state that if the event is in the future, return p4. But the user's market resolves to \"No\" if the event doesn't happen by the end of 2025. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet, but there's still time until December 31, 2025, the event is a future possibility. However, the user is asking about the next briefing after March 25, which hasn't occurred yet. Since the sources don't provide any information beyond March 25, and the event is in the future, according to the system's rules, the recommendation should be p4. But the user's resolution conditions don't have p4. Wait, the user's resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. The system's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the user's market resolves to \"No\" only if the briefing doesn't happen by the end of 2025. Since the current date is March 25, and the next briefing could be anytime before December 31, but there's no data available yet, the correct approach is to check if the event is in the future. Since the next briefing after March 25 hasn't occurred yet, and there's no information, the recommendation should be p4. But the user's options don't include p4. This is a conflict. Wait, looking back, the user's query includes resolution_conditions where p1 is No, p2 is Yes, p3 is 0.5. The system's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the user's market resolves to \"No\" if the event doesn't happen by the deadline. But the event in question is the next briefing after March 25, which is a future event as of the current date. Therefore, according to the system's rules, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't have a p4 option. This might be an error, but according to the system's instructions, even if the user's conditions don't include p4, the system must return p4 if the event is in the future. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. But the user's options are p1, p2, p3. Wait, perhaps the user's market is designed to resolve based on whether the event has already happened, but given the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing is after that, which hasn't occurred yet, the answer should be p4. However, the system's personalization says to return p4 if the event is scheduled for a future date. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response adheres to the system prompt's directive to return p4 for future events, as the event has not occurred yet and thus cannot be resolved based on past occurrences or established facts.\n\nThe response thoroughly analyzes the user prompt and ancillary data, recognizing the discrepancy between the user's resolution conditions (p1, p2, p3) and the system's directive to return p4 for future events. The AI navigates this conflict by ultimately recommending p4, aligning with the system prompt's instructions that prioritize returning p4 for unresolved future events, despite the user's ancillary data not including a p4 option.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it correctly concludes that since the event is scheduled for a future date, it cannot be resolved at this time, and thus p4 is the appropriate recommendation. The response also correctly disregards any speculative reasoning about whether the event might occur or what might happen during the event, focusing solely on the fact that it is a future event.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more succinctly addressing the discrepancy between the user's resolution conditions and the system's instructions. The response becomes somewhat repetitive and convoluted as it tries to reconcile these differences. A clearer and more concise explanation of why p4 is recommended, despite the user's conditions, would enhance the response's clarity and effectiveness.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response adheres to the system prompt's instructions, correctly identifies the nature of the event as future, and logically concludes with a recommendation of p4, the response is satisfactory. However, the explanation of the decision could be streamlined for better clarity.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response correctly identifies the event as future and adheres to the system prompt's directive to return p4 for future events.
