The user is asking about resolving a prediction market for the Alabama vs. Florida CBB game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve based on the game's outcome, including what happens if the game is postponed or canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was supposed to happen on March 15, so it's already in the past. That means I need to determine if the game occurred, was postponed, or canceled. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [4] is an article from March 15, 2025, previewing the game between Alabama and Florida in the SEC Tournament semifinals. It mentions the game time as roughly 2:30 PM CT, which converts to 3:30 PM ET. So the game was indeed scheduled for that time. \n\nSource [5] is a game recap titled \"FINAL: No. 4 Florida 104, No. 5 Alabama 82\" dated March 15, 2025. The detailed report confirms that Florida won the game decisively. The article provides a breakdown of the game, including key players' performances and the outcome. \n\nSince the game took place as scheduled and Florida won, according to the resolution conditions provided (p2 for Alabama, p1 for Florida), the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also need to check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Source [1] discusses the Sugar Bowl postponement, but that's a different event. The other sources about prediction markets and betting rules don't mention any issues with this specific game. Source [3] talks about voiding bets if a game isn't resumed within 24 hours, but since the game happened, that's not applicable here. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence from sources [4] and [5], the game occurred, and Florida won. There's no indication of cancellation or postponement affecting this market. The resolution should be p1 as per the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nThe Alabama vs. Florida SEC Tournament semifinal game occurred as scheduled on March 15, 2025, at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville. According to verified reports, **No. 4 Florida defeated No. 5 Alabama 104-82**[5]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by the detailed recap confirming tipoff at the scheduled time and a completed result[4][5]. \n\nUnder the resolution conditions provided:\n- **Florida's victory** directly triggers **p1**  \n- No postponement occurred (market closure rules irrelevant)  \n- The game was played to completion (no cancellation scenario applies)  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It verifies the date of the event, confirms the event occurred as scheduled, and checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation. The reasoning is thorough and directly addresses each condition outlined in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses verified sources to confirm the event's occurrence and outcome. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Florida win) is directly supported by the factual information provided in the sources cited.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the requirements set forth in the system prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.
