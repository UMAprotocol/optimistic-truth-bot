        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Autopen\" during his Education Event on March 20, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the term \"Autopen\" during that specific event. The event in question is the Education Event where he signed the executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources. The key ones here are the transcripts and reports from the event. \n\nSearch result [4] is a YouTube video transcript of the event. The transcript shows Trump talking about signing the document but doesn't mention \"Autopen.\" He uses a pen and jokes about using the same pen again, but no reference to Autopen there.\n\nSearch result [3] from Wake Up to Politics mentions the event and the executive order but focuses on the content of the order, not the signing process. The author references an \"autopen incident\" but clarifies that it was on their mind, not part of the event itself.\n\nSearch result [6] and [7] discuss Trump's previous comments about Autopen usage by Biden, but these are from different dates (March 17 and 21) and not during the March 20 event. \n\nSearch result [9] is a transcript where Trump is asked about using Autopen, but this is from March 18, two days before the event. He mentions using it for unimportant papers, but this isn't part of the Education Event.\n\nSearch result [13] is a press briefing on March 17 where Karoline Leavitt discusses Trump's comments on Biden's Autopen use, again not during the event in question.\n\nThe other search results ([2], [5], [8], [11], [12], [15]-[18]) discuss the executive order and the Education Department closure but don't mention Trump saying \"Autopen\" during the event.\n\nSince all the mentions of \"Autopen\" in the search results are from other dates or contexts, and the specific event's transcripts don't include the term, it's clear that Trump did not say \"Autopen\" during the March 20 Education Event. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not use the term \"Autopen\" during his March 20, 2025 Education Event and executive order signing. While the search results contain multiple references to Trump's broader criticisms of autopen usage by Joe Biden[6][7][9][13], these comments occurred in separate contexts on different dates (March 17-18 and March 21). \n\nThe video transcript from the March 20 education event[4] shows Trump specifically discussing the signing process using a physical pen (\"I'll take this one out I had one I was very lucky I signed another document... let's use that same pen\"). This aligns with the White House webcast details[1] showing a 22-minute event focused on education policy rather than signature mechanisms.\n\nThough Trump had discussed autopen limitations in a March 18 press gaggle[9] and White House staff addressed the issue in a March 17 briefing[13], these occurred outside the bounds of the defined March 20 event. The executive order text[17] and subsequent analyses[3][5][18] make no mention of signature automation tools, focusing instead on education department closure procedures.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on the event specified in the user prompt, which is the Education Event on March 20, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on whether Donald Trump mentioned the term \"Autopen\" during this specific event. The response uses multiple sources to verify that the term was not mentioned by Trump during the event, which aligns with the user prompt's requirement for resolution based on concrete evidence from the event.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking various sources related to the event, including transcripts and reports from different dates surrounding the event. It effectively rules out instances where the term \"Autopen\" was mentioned in different contexts or on different dates, which do not qualify for the market's resolution. The response is thorough in its examination of available sources, ensuring that all potential mentions of the term during the event are considered and verified.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and scrutinizes the content of the event to ensure that the term \"Autopen\" was not mentioned. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) is well-supported by the evidence provided, as it aligns with the factual information that Trump did not say \"Autopen\" during the specified event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response adequately covers the necessary details required for resolution and does not exhibit any deviation from the user prompt's conditions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt instructions, provides a logical and complete analysis based on verified facts, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the factual information verified from the event.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the absence of the term 'Autopen' during the specified event and makes a well-supported recommendation based on these findings.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931792 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:43:12 UTC",
