The ancillary data specifies that if Wisconsin wins, it resolves to p1 (Wisconsin), Northwestern to p2, and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened 12 days ago. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, multiple articles ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]) report that Wisconsin defeated Northwestern with a score of 70-63. For example, source [1] states, \"Wisconsin beat Northwestern 70-63 in the Big Ten Tournament on Thursday.\" Similarly, source [12] mentions Northwestern's season ending with a 70-63 loss to Wisconsin. All these sources consistently confirm Wisconsin's victory. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that a Wisconsin win corresponds to p1. Since the game was completed and Wisconsin won, the correct resolution is p1. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Northwestern vs. Wisconsin men's college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 2:30 PM ET concluded with a **70-63 victory for Wisconsin**[1][2][3][4][5][6][10][11][12][13][14]. The game was played as part of the Big Ten Tournament's second round, with Wisconsin advancing to the quarterfinals. Key details:  \n\n- **Final Score**: Wisconsin 70, Northwestern 63[1][3][11][13].  \n- **Top Performers**: Nolan Winter and John Tonje each scored 18 points for Wisconsin, while Nick Martinelli led Northwestern with 22 points[1][2][3][4][5][6][10][12].  \n- **Game Context**: Wisconsin maintained control in the second half with a 14-4 scoring run and held Northwestern to 37% field goal shooting[1][3][4][14].  \n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game occurred. Based on the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **Wisconsin** (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response cites multiple sources confirming this outcome, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by checking the event date relative to the current timestamp and confirming that the event has occurred in the past. It then proceeds to verify the outcome through reliable sources, as instructed.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt regarding how the market should resolve based on different outcomes. It correctly identifies that a Wisconsin win corresponds to a resolution of p1. The response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects: the event's occurrence, outcome verification, and the correct market resolution based on the provided conditions.\n\n4. **Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event. The response ensures that the recommendation corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n5. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and adherence to the instructions.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905582 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:26:22 UTC"
