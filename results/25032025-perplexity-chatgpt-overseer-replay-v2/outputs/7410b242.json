        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Manhattan\" during the Education Event on March 20, 2025, when he signed the executive order. The market resolution depends on that specific occurrence. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided sources to see if any mention Trump saying \"Manhattan\" during that event. The key sources here are the search results, especially the video transcripts and news articles covering the event.\n\nLooking at the search results, sources [1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [8], and [11] are about the Education Event. Source [11] includes a transcript from Governor Hochul's CNN interview where she quotes Trump mentioning Manhattan during the event. Specifically, Trump's statement as per the transcript is: \u201cFor instance, New York \u2014 you'll have a Manhattan and you'll have a Suffolk County and you'll have Nassau County and you'll have Westchester County. You'll do four or five or six of them. You have upstate New York and those counties, I think, are going to do very well. And I think ultimately Manhattan should do very well.\u201d\n\nThis direct quote from the event shows that Trump did say \"Manhattan\" during his speech. The other sources, like the YouTube videos and news articles, confirm the event took place but don't explicitly mention the use of \"Manhattan.\" However, source [11] is a reliable transcript from a governor's statement quoting Trump's exact words during the event. \n\nSince the resolution conditions state that any usage of the term \"Manhattan\" during the event counts, and the pluralization or possessive forms are acceptable, the mention of \"Manhattan\" in the quoted speech meets the criteria. There's no indication that the event was canceled or unaired, so the resolution should be based on the occurrence. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did say \"Manhattan\" during his March 20, 2025 Education Event and executive order signing. During his remarks about returning education authority to states and localities, Trump specifically referenced New York's administrative divisions: \"For instance, New York \u2014 you'll have a Manhattan and you'll have a Suffolk County and you'll have Nassau County and you'll have Westchester County... I think ultimately Manhattan should do very well\" [11]. This direct reference occurred within the context of discussing localized education governance during the scheduled event.\n\nThe market's resolution conditions specify that any usage of \"Manhattan\" during the event qualifies for a \"Yes\" resolution (p2), regardless of context. The term was used in its singular form without modification, satisfying the criteria that pluralization/possessive forms would count but other variations would not. No compound usage was involved in this instance.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively uses the information from the provided sources, particularly focusing on a transcript that explicitly mentions Donald Trump using the term \"Manhattan\" during the specified event. This direct quote aligns with the resolution conditions that any usage of the term \"Manhattan\" during the event counts towards a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it identifies the correct event, confirms that the term \"Manhattan\" was used by Trump during this event, and verifies that the event was not canceled or unaired. The response also correctly applies the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, such as considering any form of the word \"Manhattan\" and the context of its usage during the event.\n\nThe response does not show any significant bias or errors. It relies on a credible source (a transcript from a governor's interview) and corroborates this with additional sources that confirm the event took place as scheduled. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) is based on concrete evidence from the event's coverage, which meets the requirements of the user prompt.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to ensure that the transcript source (Governor Hochul's CNN interview) is accurate and reliable. Assuming this source is valid and correctly represents what was said during the event, the response seems satisfactory.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the use of the term 'Manhattan' during the specified event, adheres to the resolution conditions, and uses credible sources to verify the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and logically sound, effectively using the provided sources to confirm the event's occurrence and the specific usage of the term as per the market's resolution conditions.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742922361 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:06:01 UTC",
