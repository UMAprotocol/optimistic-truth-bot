The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Brooklyn Nets vs. Boston Celtics game scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Celtics win, it's p1; Nets win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game in question is in the past. Next, I check the search results to find the game's outcome. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple results mention the game on March 18. Source [1] states the Celtics beat the Nets, with Porzingis scoring 25 points. Source [2] provides the final score as 104-96 in favor of the Celtics. Source [4] and [5] also confirm the Celtics' victory with the same score. Additionally, source [9] from WAMC Sports Report on March 19, 2025, reiterates the Celtics' 104-96 win, led by Scheierman and Porzingis. \n\nAll these sources consistently report the Celtics as the winners. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event occurred and the Celtics won, the resolution should be p1. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Celtics defeated the Brooklyn Nets 104-96 in their March 18, 2025 matchup at TD Garden. Multiple sources confirm this outcome, with Kristaps Porzingis (25 points, 13 rebounds) and Baylor Scheierman (career-high 20 points) leading Boston's effort[1][2][4][9]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports.\n\nKey details:\n- **Final score**: Celtics 104, Nets 96[2][12]\n- **Game date**: Played March 18, 2025 at 7:30 PM ET as scheduled[1][4]\n- **Key players**: Porzingis recorded a double-double while Scheierman scored 13 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter[9][12]\n- **Standings impact**: Extended Boston's win streak against Brooklyn to 8 games[4][5]\n\nAs the Celtics won the game outright and it was completed as scheduled, the market resolves according to the first condition of the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
