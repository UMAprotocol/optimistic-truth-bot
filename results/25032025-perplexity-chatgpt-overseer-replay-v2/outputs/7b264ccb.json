        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Trans\" during his Education Event on March 20, 2025, when he signed an Executive Order. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided for any mention of Trump's speech during that specific event. The key here is the exact date and time of the event: March 20, 2025, 4:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that only the scheduled Education Event counts, so other speeches or events before or after that date don't matter here.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [11] is a fact sheet from the White House dated March 20, 2025, about the Executive Order. It mentions returning education authority to states and dismantling bureaucracy, but there's no direct quote of Trump using the word \"Trans\" here. The order directs that programs receiving Education funds won't advance \"gender ideology,\" which is related but not the exact term.\n\nResult [12] is a statement from the Secretary of Education on the same day, March 20, 2025, supporting the Executive Order. Again, the focus is on states' rights and cutting bureaucracy, but no mention of Trump saying \"Trans.\"\n\nResult [10] is a transcript of Trump's joint address to Congress on March 5, 2025. He talks about banning transgender ideology in schools and mentions \"transgender\" several times, but this event is on March 5, which is before the March 20 Education Event. So this doesn't count.\n\nResult [15] is about Trump's speech to Congress on March 4, 2025, where he again mentions transgender issues, but again, that's a different event.\n\nResult [16] is a statement from the Washington State Superintendent on February 6, 2025, reacting to an earlier executive order about trans athletes. Not the March 20 event.\n\nResult [17] is Trump's inauguration speech on January 20, 2025, where he mentions gender policies but doesn't use \"Trans\" in the quoted parts.\n\nThe other results ([1]-[9], [13]-[14]) are about various executive orders and policies targeting transgender people, but none specifically mention the March 20 Education Event or Trump using the word \"Trans\" during that event.\n\nSince none of the search results provide evidence that Trump said \"Trans\" during the March 20 event, and the resolution conditions state that only that specific event counts, the answer should be \"No.\" Even though he's discussed transgender issues extensively in other speeches, the query is strictly about the March 20 Education Event. Without any direct evidence from that event, the resolution is \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump's March 20, 2025 Education Event involved signing an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education and return authority to states[11][12]. The order explicitly prohibited federal funds from supporting \"gender ideology\" programs[11], but **no evidence exists in the provided sources that Trump uttered the specific word \"Trans\" during this event**.\n\nKey details:\n- The White House fact sheet about the event[11] and Education Secretary Linda McMahon's statement[12] describe the order's focus on eliminating DEI initiatives and bureaucratic control, but neither document quotes Trump using the term \"Trans.\"\n- While Trump discussed transgender issues extensively in other March 2025 speeches[10][15], these occurred at separate events (joint congressional addresses on March 4 and 5) and don't qualify under this market's resolution rules.\n- The executive order signed during the Education Event targeted \"gender ideology\" rather than using the specific term \"Trans,\" continuing his administration's pattern of avoiding direct references to transgender identities while implementing anti-trans policies[5][9].\n\nGiven the resolution conditions explicitly limit consideration to the March 20 Education Event and its associated executive order signing, **there is no verified instance of Trump saying \"Trans\" during this specific appearance**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions by focusing solely on the specific event on March 20, 2025, and whether Donald Trump used the word \"Trans\" during this event. The response correctly identifies and excludes references to other dates and events that do not pertain to the specific query, such as Trump's speeches on other dates.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically examining available sources related to the event and determining that none of these sources confirm the use of the word \"Trans\" by Trump during the event. The response also correctly interprets the ancillary data and the specific conditions under which the market should resolve, focusing on the exact term \"Trans\" and its usage during the event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and examines the content related to the event. It aligns the recommendation with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt, concluding that there is no evidence of Trump saying \"Trans\" during the event, leading to a recommendation of p1 (No).\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response stays objective and focused on the query without introducing irrelevant information or speculation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the user prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns correctly with the established facts and the specific conditions of the market resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, logically analyzes the available information, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the facts and conditions specified.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm the absence of the term 'Trans' during the specified event, leading to an accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929655 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:07:35 UTC",
