The ancillary data specifies that if SC State wins, it's p1; Coppin State, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 12, so the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [4], [5], [6], [8], [10], [14]) report the game took place on March 12, 2025. The final score from these sources consistently states SC State won 68-63. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The search results don't indicate any postponement or cancellation. In fact, sources like [6] detail the game's progression, confirming it was played as scheduled. \n\nNext, check the resolution conditions. Since the game happened and SC State won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information in the sources about the outcome. All relevant sources agree on the result, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nSouth Carolina State defeated Coppin State 68-63 in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Tournament quarterfinal on March 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources detailing the game's outcome[1][4][5][6][8][10][14]. The Bulldogs secured the victory with Wilson Dubinsky leading the team with 20 points, extending their winning streak to nine games[1][5][10]. Coppin State's season ended with a 6-24 record[6]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game was required[1][4][5][6][8][10][14]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Coppin State vs. SC State basketball game) occurred on March 12, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The response adheres to the instruction to only report on events that have already occurred and can be verified through reliable sources. The outcome of the game is reported as an SC State win with a score of 68-63, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition for an SC State win (p1).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks whether the game was postponed or canceled and confirms that it was neither. It then proceeds to verify the game's outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the resolution is based on concrete evidence. The response is thorough in detailing the game's outcome and the performance of key players, which supports the credibility of the sources and the factual accuracy of the event's outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, which is a requirement of the system prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and system instructions without adding unnecessary information or speculation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified facts and the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and logically aligns the recommendation with the verified facts and user prompt conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses multiple sources for verification, and provides a clear and accurate resolution recommendation based on the event's outcome.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742922570 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:09:30 UTC"
