The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the New York Rangers and Los Angeles Kings on March 25, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1; if the Rangers win, p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 26, 2025, so the game date (March 25) is in the past. Now, I need to find out the result of that game. \n\nLooking at the search results, sources [4], [5], [6], and [7] all report on the game. The headlines from [4] and [5] clearly state the Kings won 3-1. The LA Times article [6] confirms the same score, and [7] also mentions the Kings' victory. These are all reputable sources, so the outcome is well-documented. \n\nThe ancillary data says a Kings win resolves to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports indicate the game took place as planned. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Kings). \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all the recent sources from March 26 agree on the result. The pre-game predictions in [2], [8], and [9] are from before the game and don't affect the outcome. The other sources about Rangers' ownership and liquidation are unrelated to this specific game. \n\nSince the game occurred, and the Kings won, the resolution is p1. No complications like postponement or cancellation are present. All criteria are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the New York Rangers and Los Angeles Kings scheduled for March 25, 2025, at 10:30 PM ET concluded with a **3-1 victory for the Los Angeles Kings**[4][5][6][7]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Kevin Fiala** scored two goals, including an empty-netter, while **Phillip Danault** added a power-play goal in his 700th NHL game[5][6].\n- Kings goaltender **Darcy Kuemper** made 22 saves, and the team extended their home point streak to 15 games (12-0-3)[4][5].\n- The Rangers' lone goal came from **J.T. Miller**, with the result confirmed after video review[5][6].\n\nThe game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[4][5][6][7]. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Kings\"** (p1) as the outcome.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (NHL game between the New York Rangers and Los Angeles Kings on March 25, 2025) and verifies that it occurred as scheduled, which aligns with the system prompt's requirement to report on events that have already occurred. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is a Kings victory. This outcome matches the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Kings win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first verifying the date and occurrence of the event, then confirming the outcome through reputable sources. It correctly ignores irrelevant pre-game predictions and other unrelated information, focusing solely on the event's outcome. The response also checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which there were none, ensuring the resolution conditions are met without overlooking any details.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the information is reliable and not based on a single source. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Kings win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the facts and provided sources for its claims, maintaining an unbiased and accurate resolution.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of the event, adherence to the resolution conditions, and alignment with the ancillary data, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. There is no need for a rerun or default to p4, as the response meets all the required criteria for accuracy and reliability.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, adheres to the resolution conditions, and aligns perfectly with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses multiple sources for verification, and correctly ignores irrelevant information, focusing strictly on the event in question.\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743016450 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:14:10 UTC"
