        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if there have been 300 or more confirmed measles cases in the U.S. in 2025 according to the CDC by March 28, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The answer needs to be based strictly on the CDC's data, and other sources like state reports don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The deadline is March 28, so we're a few days before that. The key here is to look at the CDC's latest data provided in the search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [6] from the CDC's own page, updated on March 21, 2025, states there are 378 confirmed cases. That's well above 300. Other sources like [1], [2], [3], and [5] also mention numbers around 301 to 308, but those are from earlier dates (March 13-17). However, the CDC's own data in [6] is the most authoritative and up-to-date, showing 378 cases as of March 20. \n\nThe user's note specifies that only CDC-reported cases matter, so even if other sources have slightly different numbers, the CDC's count is definitive. Since 378 is over 300, the answer should be \"Yes\". Also, the resolution time hasn't passed yet, but the CDC's data as of March 20 already exceeds 300. Unless there's a drastic revision, which isn't indicated, the condition is met. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe CDC's Measles (Rubeola) case counter reported **378 confirmed cases** as of March 20, 2025, according to its latest update[6]. This exceeds the 300-case threshold specified in the market's resolution conditions. Key details:\n\n- **CDC Data**: The [official CDC page](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) shows 378 cases across 18 jurisdictions, with 90% linked to outbreaks[6].\n- **Timeliness**: The CDC updates its tracker weekly, and the March 20 figure is the most recent available before the March 28 resolution deadline.\n- **Exclusion of Non-CDC Sources**: While some earlier reports cite slightly lower numbers (e.g., 301 cases as of March 13\u201317[1][2][5]), the resolution conditions explicitly prioritize the CDC\u2019s counter over state or third-party data.\n\nSince the CDC\u2019s confirmed case count (378) surpasses 300 before the resolution deadline, the market should resolve to **Yes**. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the user's query about whether there have been 300 or more confirmed measles cases in the U.S. in 2025 according to the CDC by March 28, 2025. It adheres to the instruction to use only the CDC's data as specified in the user prompt. The response also correctly notes the current date and the resolution deadline, confirming that the event is still upcoming but the latest available data can be used to resolve the query.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the available data from the CDC, noting that the most recent update shows 378 confirmed cases, which is above the threshold of 300 cases required for a \"Yes\" resolution. It correctly disregards other sources, sticking strictly to the CDC data as per the user prompt requirements.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event (number of measles cases reported by the CDC) and aligns the recommendation with the facts presented. The CDC's report of 378 cases as of March 20, 2025, is used to substantiate the recommendation of \"Yes\" (p2).\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the CDC data, as required, and provides a clear and direct answer based on this data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the facts verified from the specified source (CDC), and there is no indication of bias or error in the processing of the information.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately uses the CDC data to resolve the query, adheres to the instructions, and logically concludes based on the most recent and relevant data available.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively addresses the user's query using the specified source and provides a clear and accurate resolution recommendation based on the data provided.\"\n}\n```",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
