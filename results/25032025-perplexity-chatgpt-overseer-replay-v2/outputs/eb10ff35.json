The ancillary data specifies that if Lyon advances, it's p1; FCSB, p2; and if the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the dates of the matches. The current date given is March 25, 2025. The search results mention two legs: the first leg on March 6, 2025, and the second leg on March 13, 2025. Both dates are before the current date, so the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the first leg (March 6, 2025), sources [5], [8], [12], and [13] indicate that Lyon won 3-1 away against FCSB. The second leg (March 13, 2025) is covered in sources [1], [2], [6], [9], and [14], where Lyon won 4-0 at home. The aggregate score from both legs would be 7-1 in favor of Lyon. \n\nThe search results consistently report Lyon's victories in both matches, with detailed highlights and scores. There's no mention of the match being canceled or postponed. All sources confirm Lyon's advancement to the next round. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Lyon).\n</think>\n\nLyon advanced to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals after defeating FCSB 7-1 on aggregate in their Round of 16 tie. The first leg on March 6, 2025, ended 3-1 in favor of Lyon at FCSB's National Arena[5][8][12][13], with Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico opening the scoring and Malick Fofana adding two late goals[12]. The second leg on March 13, 2025, saw Lyon dominate 4-0 at Groupama Stadium, with Georges Mikautadze and Ernest Nuamah each scoring twice[1][2][6][9]. The comprehensive aggregate victory confirms Lyon's progression to the next round.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The AI checked the dates of the matches and confirmed that both legs occurred before the current date, ensuring that the event is not a future event. The response adheres to the instruction to resolve based on factual occurrences and verified information, using multiple sources to confirm the match results.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It correctly interprets the conditions for resolution (p1 for Lyon advancing, p2 for FCSB, and p3 for a postponed or canceled match). The AI then matches these conditions with the factual outcomes of the matches, concluding that Lyon advanced, which aligns with p1.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verifies the event's occurrence by checking the dates and outcomes of both legs of the match. It uses multiple sources to confirm that Lyon won both legs, thus advancing to the next round. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with these verified facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI effectively uses the sources to confirm the match outcomes and does not show any signs of bias or incorrect data.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905215 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:20:15 UTC"
