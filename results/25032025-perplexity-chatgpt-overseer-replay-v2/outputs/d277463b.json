        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the St. Louis vs. Arkansas State basketball game played on March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if St. Louis wins, the market resolves to \"St. Louis\" (p2), and if Arkansas State wins, it resolves to \"Arkansas State\" (p1). If the game is postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it resolves 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 18, so the game should have taken place. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game was played on March 18. For example, source [1] states Arkansas State won 103-78, and source [2] and [5] also report the same score. \n\nNext, verify the outcome. All relevant sources mention Arkansas State's victory. The final score from the box score in [2] is 103-78 in favor of Arkansas State. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the game was played and Arkansas State won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information in the sources, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nArkansas State defeated Saint Louis 103-78 in the NIT first-round game played on March 18, 2025, as scheduled[1][2][5][7]. The Red Wolves led wire-to-wire, shooting 54.1% from the field with 16 three-pointers made[1][5]. Key performances included:\n\n- **Izaiyah Nelson**: 26 points, 10 rebounds (Arkansas State)[2][5]\n- **Taryn Todd**: 21 points, 7 assists (Arkansas State)[2][5]\n- **Robbie Avila**: 22 points (Saint Louis)[1][2]\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up contingency applies. According to the resolution conditions, Arkansas State's victory triggers **p1** resolution.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the query based on the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (St. Louis vs. Arkansas State basketball game) occurred on March 18, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the event date. The AI checked multiple sources to confirm that the game was not postponed or canceled and that Arkansas State won the game. This aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where Arkansas State's win corresponds to a \"p1\" resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the sequence of checks required by the system prompt: verifying the event date, confirming the event occurred, checking the outcome, and ensuring no postponement or cancellation occurred. The AI then concludes with the correct market resolution based on the verified outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation of \"p1\" is based on verified facts that Arkansas State won the game. The response includes specific details from the game, such as the final score and key performances, which supports the credibility of the sources and the accuracy of the event's outcome.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI has adhered strictly to the user prompt and system instructions without adding unnecessary or unverified information.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the provided instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data and the factual outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the event, adhering to the system prompt instructions and user prompt conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used verified sources to confirm the event's outcome and provided a clear, factual basis for the resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927793 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:36:33 UTC"
