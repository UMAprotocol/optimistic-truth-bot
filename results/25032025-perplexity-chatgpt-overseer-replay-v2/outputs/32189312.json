        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Fart\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he used the exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The resolution source is the video of the speech.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the word \"Fart.\" The search results [1][2][3][9][10] discuss Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit, focusing on Bitcoin policies and the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. None of these sources mention him saying \"Fart.\" \n\nHowever, results [5][7][14][15][16] talk about a betting market on whether someone farted during the event. Specifically, there was an audible sound after Trump's speech, which some thought was a fart. But the query is about Trump himself saying the word, not an actual fart sound. The articles mention Polymarket's bet on the fart noise, but that's unrelated to Trump uttering the term \"Fart.\"\n\nAdditionally, result [8] mentions a meme coin called Fartcoin, but again, no indication Trump mentioned it. Result [11] refers to a 2024 incident where Trump was accused of farting in court, but that's a different event and time. Result [13] is a YouTube video from 2018, irrelevant here.\n\nThe key point is the distinction between Trump saying the word \"Fart\" versus a physical sound. The ancillary data clearly states the term must be spoken by Trump. Since all sources about the speech don't mention him using that word, and the betting markets are about a noise, not his verbal statement, the answer should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered a pre-recorded speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, focusing on cryptocurrency policy and the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Multiple sources confirm his remarks addressed Bitcoin adoption, institutional crypto strategies, and legislative efforts to acquire 1 million BTC for national reserves[1][2][3][9][10]. While ancillary discussions emerged about an audible noise resembling flatulence captured on the event livestream[5][14][16], these reports pertain to post-speech audio artifacts rather than Trump verbally using the term \"Fart.\"\n\nThe resolution conditions specify that only explicit verbal usage of \"Fart\" (including plural/possessive forms) by Trump during his speech or its immediate Q&A would qualify. No sources indicate Trump uttered this term, with all verified transcripts and analyses of his address focusing exclusively on digital asset policy. The Polymarket betting activity referenced in multiple articles relates to an ambiguous sound detected after his speech concluded, not to any spoken language by Trump[5][14][16].\n\nGiven the evidence, Trump did not say \"Fart\" during his Digital Asset Summit appearance as defined by the market's parameters. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively addresses the user's query about whether Donald Trump said the word \"Fart\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The AI has correctly identified that the resolution of the market depends on Trump verbally using the term \"Fart,\" and it has thoroughly checked multiple sources to confirm that no such utterance occurred during the speech.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI distinguishes between the actual utterance of the word and other unrelated instances, such as the sound of a fart or references to unrelated events. This shows a good understanding of the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, which require the term to be spoken by Trump during the speech or its immediate Q&A.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The AI confirms that the speech took place as scheduled and that the term \"Fart\" was not mentioned by Trump, based on the evidence from verified transcripts and analyses of the speech. The response also correctly ignores irrelevant information, such as the betting market on a noise and references to unrelated events.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has used the correct sources for its analysis, as specified in the user prompt, and has aligned its recommendation with the ancillary data provided.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and the adherence to the instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user's query, adhering to the system prompt instructions and using the correct sources for verification.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively distinguishes between relevant and irrelevant information, adheres strictly to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, and provides a well-reasoned and fact-based recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932243 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:50:43 UTC",
