        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution depends on whether those exact terms were used, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The updates mention that the video address counts, so even though it's pre-recorded, it's valid.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using those terms. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [5] provides the full text of Trump's speech. Scanning through it, he mentions \"David Sacks, our White House AI and Crypto Director\". Here, \"AI\" is used as part of a title. That's a direct mention of \"AI\", which counts according to the resolution conditions. \n\nOther sources like [7] and [8] discuss the content of the speech but don't explicitly quote him saying \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\". Source [9] and others talk about AI in general but not in the specific speech context. \n\nSince the full transcript in [5] includes \"AI\" in his address, that's a clear instance. There's no mention of \"Artificial Intelligence\" in the speech text provided. However, the use of \"AI\" alone is sufficient for the market to resolve to \"Yes\". The ancillary data states that any usage of the term counts, regardless of context. Therefore, the answer should be p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did use the term \"AI\" during his recorded address at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. In his speech, he explicitly referred to **\"David Sacks, our White House AI and Crypto Director\"** when discussing personnel appointments related to digital asset policy[5]. This direct mention of \"AI\" in an official title satisfies the resolution criteria requiring either \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" to be spoken during the qualifying speech.\n\nThe administration's focus on AI was further contextualized through:\n- Creation of a White House AI and Crypto Director position\n- References to AI policy coordination with cryptocurrency initiatives\n- Strategic alignment of emerging technologies in national policy[5][7]\n\nWhile Trump didn't use the full phrase \"Artificial Intelligence,\" the abbreviated form \"AI\" meets the resolution requirements as defined in the ancillary data. The video address format was explicitly validated through the March 19 update as qualifying for resolution[8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate and complete in addressing the user prompt. The response correctly identifies that Donald Trump used the term \"AI\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, which meets the resolution criteria specified in the user prompt. The response also correctly disregards any need for the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" since the use of \"AI\" alone is sufficient for the market to resolve to \"Yes.\"\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it directly ties the evidence from the source to the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt. The response also correctly includes the update that Trump's video address counts towards the market's resolution, which is crucial for validating the format of the speech.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response uses the specified source to confirm that the event occurred and that the term \"AI\" was used in the context required for resolution. There is no indication of missing information, bias, or errors in the response.\n\nThe response adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt, ensuring that the resolution is based solely on concrete evidence and established facts from the specified source. The recommendation aligns with the definitions provided in the ancillary data, and the response ensures strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934154 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:22:34 UTC",
