        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Hamas entered Israel between March 17 and March 21, 2025, based on the defined conditions. The ancillary data specifies that \"Yes\" (p2) is if Hamas personnel entered Israeli territory from Gaza for combat operations during that period. The resolution relies on official Israeli confirmation or credible reports.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any events in that timeframe. The search results mention the March 18, 2025 Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, which ended the ceasefire. The sources [1], [3], and [4] detail the attacks starting on March 18. However, these are Israeli strikes on Gaza, not Hamas entering Israel. \n\nLooking at the dates in the query (March 17-21), the main event is Israel's attack on Gaza. The sources don't mention Hamas crossing into Israel during this period. Instead, the IDF conducted ground operations in Gaza, like retaking the Netzarim Corridor [2][6][10][13]. \n\nSource [9] mentions Hamas preparing for a cross-border attack, but it's a warning from March 18, not an actual incursion. The ceasefire ended on March 18, and Israel resumed strikes, but there's no report of Hamas entering Israel. \n\nThe resolution conditions require evidence of Hamas entering Israeli territory. All the sources discuss Israeli military actions in Gaza, not Hamas moving into Israel. Since the user's timeframe is up to March 21, and the search results don't indicate any such event, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). \n\nAlso, the ancillary data specifies buffer zones in Gaza don't count. The IDF operations were within Gaza, so even if Hamas was present there, it doesn't meet the criteria. No credible reports or official confirmations of Hamas entering Israel during those dates are found in the provided sources. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether Hamas personnel entered Israeli territory from Gaza for combat operations between March 17 and March 21, 2025. Based on verified events and the resolution criteria:\n\n1. **Timeline of hostilities**: Israel launched a surprise attack on Gaza on March 18, 2025, ending the ceasefire[1][3][4]. This operation included airstrikes and ground forces retaking the Netzarim Corridor[2][6][10][13], but **no evidence exists of Hamas crossing into Israel during this window**.\n\n2. **Hamas activity**: While Israeli officials warned of Hamas' intent to conduct cross-border attacks[9], the IDF's renewed operations focused on preempting such efforts within Gaza[4][8]. Hamas rocket fire targeted Israeli communities[13], but these are air-based attacks excluded by the resolution terms.\n\n3. **Geographic scope**: The IDF's ground operations occurred entirely within Gaza, including buffer zones like the Netzarim Corridor[2][6]. The resolution explicitly excludes buffer zones from qualifying as \"Israeli territory.\"\n\n4. **Resolution sources**: No official Israeli reports or credible third-party accounts indicate Hamas ground incursions into Israel during this period. All documented militant activity occurred within Gaza[1][3][5][10].\n\n**Recommendation: p1** (No) \u2013 No verifiable instances of Hamas personnel entering Israeli territory as defined.",

The response is structured to analyze the event based on the conditions specified in the user prompt and uses multiple sources to verify the absence of any Hamas incursion into Israeli territory during the specified timeframe.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question is whether Hamas entered Israeli territory, not other related activities such as Israeli strikes on Gaza or Hamas preparations for attacks. It adheres to the instruction to focus solely on verified facts and to use credible sources for verification. The response also correctly identifies that the event is in the past and thus can be resolved based on available information.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically assesses the information from various sources, noting the lack of evidence for any Hamas personnel entering Israeli territory. It correctly concludes that activities within Gaza or in buffer zones do not meet the criteria for resolution as specified in the user prompt. The reasoning is thorough and considers all necessary aspects of the query.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that no credible reports or official confirmations indicate that Hamas entered Israeli territory during the specified dates. This aligns with the resolution conditions that require concrete evidence of such an event. The recommendation of p1 (No) is based on a comprehensive review of the available sources and is aligned with the facts as verified.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI has focused strictly on the event specified and used appropriate sources to confirm the absence of the event.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis and adherence to the prompt requirements, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and reliable for resolving the query. The recommendation of p1 (No) is well-supported by the evidence presented and the logical interpretation of the user prompt and system instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately assesses the event based on the user prompt and verified sources, providing a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the absence of the event in question and adheres closely to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928227 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:43:47 UTC",
