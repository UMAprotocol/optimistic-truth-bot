        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Leon Edwards vs. Sean Brady UFC fight that happened on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Brady wins, it's p1; Edwards, p2; and if there's a draw or other issues, p3. The resolution source is ESPN, but credible reports can be used.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm who won. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. Source [1] is a YouTube video from ESPN MMA dated March 22, 2025, stating that Sean Brady submitted Leon Edwards in the fourth round with a guillotine choke. The transcript mentions Brady forcing Edwards to tap out. That's a clear submission win for Brady.\n\n2. Source [2] from MMA Junkie on March 25, 2025, also confirms Brady's victory, mentioning he dominated and submitted Edwards. It includes post-fight comments from Brady about Edwards' reaction, which supports the outcome.\n\n3. Source [5] (Combat Press) lists the results, showing Brady won by submission in Round 4. Source [7] (ESPN India) provides detailed fight stats, confirming the submission at 1:39 of Round 4. \n\n4. Other sources like [3] and [4] are pre-fight predictions and don't affect the outcome. Source [6] is a video clip from ESPN showing the submission, and source [8] from Bleacher Report also lists Brady as the winner.\n\nAll credible sources, including ESPN, report Brady's victory via submission. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. The event took place as scheduled on March 22, 2025, and the result is confirmed by multiple reliable outlets. \n\nSince the resolution conditions state that Brady's win corresponds to p1, and all evidence points to his victory, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nSean Brady defeated Leon Edwards via submission (single-arm guillotine choke) at 1:39 of Round 4 in the main event of UFC Fight Night: Edwards vs. Brady on March 22, 2025. Multiple credible sources including ESPN's official fight results [1][7], post-fight analysis [2], and combat sports publications [5][8] confirm Brady secured the victory through this technical submission. The bout occurred as scheduled with no reports of postponement or cancellation.  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, this outcome corresponds to p1 (Brady declared winner).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Leon Edwards vs. Sean Brady UFC fight on March 22, 2025) and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The AI checked multiple credible sources, including ESPN, which is the primary resolution source mentioned in the prompt. The response uses these sources to verify the outcome of the fight, which is that Sean Brady won by submission. This outcome aligns with the resolution condition p1 for Brady's victory.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with a verification of the event date and outcome, followed by a detailed examination of multiple sources to confirm the result. The AI effectively uses the information from these sources to conclude that the fight was not postponed, canceled, or ended in a draw, which would have triggered other resolution conditions (p3 or p4).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation of p1 is based on verified facts from multiple sources that confirm Sean Brady's victory. This aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Brady win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has covered all necessary aspects to ensure the resolution is accurate based on the provided conditions and sources.\n\nGiven this analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation of p1 is well-supported by the evidence provided and correctly corresponds to the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple credible sources and aligns the recommendation with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the specified resolution source and additional credible reports to confirm the event outcome, adhering closely to the system prompt instructions without any observable errors or biases.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742916938 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 15:35:38 UTC"
