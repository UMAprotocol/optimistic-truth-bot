The user wants to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the Maryland-Eastern Shore vs. Norfolk State basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Norfolk State wins, it's p1; if MD Eastern Shore wins, p2; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 12. So the game should have happened. Now, looking at the search results, several sources confirm the game took place. \n\nSearch result [1] from CBS Sports and [7] from ESPN both report that Norfolk State defeated Maryland-Eastern Shore 77-70 on March 12. The AP story in [1] details the game, mentioning Jalen Myers scoring 22 points for Norfolk State. Similarly, [7] provides the final score and stats, reinforcing the outcome. \n\nOther sources like [3] and [5] are predictions made before the game, giving Norfolk State a high chance to win, but those are just forecasts. The key here is the actual game results. Since the game was played as scheduled and Norfolk State won, the resolution should be p1. \n\nI also need to check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All the post-March 12 sources ([1], [7]) discuss the game as having occurred, so no postponement or cancellation. Therefore, the market should resolve to Norfolk State (p1) as the winner.\n</think>\n\nThe March 12, 2025, college basketball game between Maryland-Eastern Shore (MD Eastern Shore) and Norfolk State concluded with **Norfolk State winning 77-70** in the MEAC Tournament quarterfinals[1][7]. The game was played as scheduled at Norfolk Scope Arena, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the search results. \n\nKey details confirming the outcome:\n- Norfolk State led 38-26 at halftime and maintained control throughout[1][7].\n- Jalen Myers scored 22 points for Norfolk State, while Evan Johnson led MD Eastern Shore with 22 points[1][7].\n- Final stats and box scores confirm the result[7].\n\nSince the game occurred as planned and Norfolk State won decisively, the market resolves to **p1 (Norfolk State)** under the specified conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Maryland-Eastern Shore vs. Norfolk State basketball game) occurred on March 12, 2025, and provides a detailed account of the outcome based on reliable sources such as CBS Sports and ESPN. The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event's occurrence and outcome without predicting or assuming results not supported by evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and occurrence of the event, then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly ignores pre-game predictions and focuses on actual results, which is in line with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the game was not postponed or canceled and that Norfolk State won the game. This verification aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where Norfolk State's win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response is focused and strictly adheres to the facts required for resolution.\n\nGiven the above points, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the provided instructions.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906390 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:39:50 UTC"
