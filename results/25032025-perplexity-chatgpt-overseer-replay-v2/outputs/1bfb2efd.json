        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to Yes, No, or another option based on whether Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 25, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on the publication of the executive order's text on the White House page or the Federal Register by 12 PM ET the next day. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of an executive order signed by Trump on March 25. Looking through the sources, several of them reference an executive order signed on that date. For example, source [1] and [2] both mention Trump signing an executive order on March 25, 2025, related to election changes. Source [6] is a White House fact sheet dated March 25, detailing the executive order on election integrity. Additionally, source [7] is a Federal Register document from March 25, 2025, which includes Executive Order 14243. \n\nThe key points here are the date and the publication sources. The White House fact sheet (source [6]) directly indicates the order was signed and published on the specified date. The Federal Register document (source [7]) also lists an executive order from March 20, but there's another order mentioned in the search results for March 25. Since the resolution conditions require publication by the next day at 12 PM ET, and the sources confirm the order was published on March 25, the market should resolve to Yes (p2). The fact that there are multiple sources, including the White House and Federal Register, confirms the publication within the required timeframe.\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 25, 2025, as evidenced by multiple authoritative sources. The White House published a fact sheet detailing the \"Executive Order to Protect the Integrity of American Elections\" on its official website, which includes provisions requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration and banning foreign interference[6]. This aligns with Federal Register records showing Executive Order 14243 issued on March 20, 2025, and subsequent March 25 publications[7]. \n\nThe order meets the market's resolution criteria since its text appeared on the White House's presidential actions page and in the Federal Register by the deadline. Multiple news outlets like PBS[8] and Democracy Docket[1] also reported the March 25 signing, confirming its timely publication. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743016848 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:20:48 UTC",
