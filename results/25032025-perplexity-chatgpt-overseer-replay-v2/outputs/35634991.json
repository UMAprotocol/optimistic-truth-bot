The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Seattle Kraken vs. Calgary Flames game scheduled for March 25, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Flames win, it's p1; if the Kraken win, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 26, 2025, so the game date has already passed. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the game date as March 25, and some even provide post-game details. For example, result [6] from CBS Sports clearly states that the Flames beat the Kraken 4-3 in overtime, with Nazem Kadri scoring the winning goal. This is a reliable source confirming the outcome.\n\nOther sources like [7] and [8] had predictions before the game, but [6] is a post-game report, which is crucial. The score and details match the actual event. The Flames' victory is confirmed, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Flames). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All signs point to the Flames winning, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Seattle Kraken and Calgary Flames on March 25, 2025, concluded with the **Calgary Flames winning 4-3 in overtime**, as confirmed by post-game reports[6]. Nazem Kadri scored the decisive goal at 3:58 into overtime, securing the Flames' fourth consecutive comeback victory[6]. \n\nKey details from the game:\n- The Flames overcame a 3-2 deficit in the third period after Jordan Eberle tied the game for the Kraken with 1:30 remaining in regulation[6].\n- Calgary improved to 33-25-11, while Seattle fell to 30-36-5[6][4].\n- The game was played as scheduled at Scotiabank Saddledome with no indications of postponement or cancellation[6][4][5].\n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1 (\"Flames\")** as Calgary secured the victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the query based on the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the outcome of the NHL game between the Seattle Kraken and Calgary Flames, which took place on March 25, 2025. The AI used a reliable source (CBS Sports) to confirm that the Calgary Flames won the game 4-3 in overtime. This outcome aligns with the user's ancillary data where a Flames win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm the event has occurred. It then verifies the outcome using a post-game report, which is a direct and reliable source for this type of information. The AI also confirms that there were no indications of the game being postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions set in the user prompt for resolving the market.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using a credible source. The details provided about the game, such as the score, key players, and the sequence of events leading to the final score, are specific and relevant to the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (\"Flames\") is correctly aligned with these facts.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt and uses appropriate sources to confirm the outcome. It does not introduce irrelevant information or speculative content, adhering strictly to the facts.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the event's outcome using verified facts and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses a reliable source to confirm the event outcome and provides a clear, factual basis for the resolution recommendation.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
