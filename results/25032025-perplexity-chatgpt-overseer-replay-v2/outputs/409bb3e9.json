The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Dallas Stars vs. Colorado Avalanche game scheduled for March 16, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Avalanche win, p2 for Stars win, p3 if canceled, and 50-50 if no make-up. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 26, 2025, which is after the game date. Looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 6, 8, 14) report that the game took place on March 16. The Avalanche won 4-3 in overtime with Cale Makar scoring the winning goal. \n\nNext, confirm there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. The sources detail the game's events, including the overtime play, indicating it was completed. The NHL.com recap (1) and ESPN's box score (6) both confirm the game occurred and concluded. Additionally, the CBS Sports recap (14) mentions the overtime win, solidifying that the game wasn't postponed or canceled.\n\nSince the game was played and the Avalanche won, the market should resolve to p1. No sources suggest any issues with the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All evidence points to a completed game with a clear outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche on March 16, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET was played as scheduled. The Colorado Avalanche defeated the Dallas Stars 4-3 in overtime, with Cale Makar scoring the game-winning goal 34 seconds into the extra period[1][6][14]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by multiple detailed recaps of the game's events, including third-period rallies and overtime play[1][6][8][14]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided:\n- **p1 (Avalanche win)** applies since Colorado secured the victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the occurrence of the NHL game between the Dallas Stars and the Colorado Avalanche on March 16, 2025, and confirms that the Colorado Avalanche won the game. The response uses multiple sources to substantiate the game's outcome and ensures that there was no postponement or cancellation, which aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks for the game's occurrence, outcome, and any potential issues like postponements or cancellations. The response then correctly aligns the verified outcome with the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data (p1 for Avalanche win), leading to a recommendation of p1.\n\nThe verification of the event is thorough, with references to multiple sources that confirm the game was played and concluded with an Avalanche victory. This approach ensures that the recommendation is based on concrete evidence and established facts, as required by the system prompt.\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the instructions to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred and to report based on verified facts. It also correctly identifies that the event is not a future event relative to the current timestamp, thus proceeding with a resolution recommendation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts and the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns with the resolution conditions, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event details and outcome, ensuring a reliable and accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742986083 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:48:03 UTC"
