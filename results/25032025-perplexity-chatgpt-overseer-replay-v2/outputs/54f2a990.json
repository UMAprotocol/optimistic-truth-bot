        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump issued an executive order on March 12, 2025, based on the provided search results. The resolution conditions specify that the answer must be \"Yes\" if the order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or through the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. Otherwise, it's \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of an executive order on March 12. Let's go through each source. \n\nLooking at source [1], the latest date mentioned is March 20, 2025, with several EOs. No mention of March 12. Source [2] has entries up to March 4, 2025. Source [4] from March 12, 2025, is titled \"Tracking Trump - All of President Trump's Executive Orders \u2013 March 12th, 2025.\" The content lists multiple EOs signed on January 20, 2025, but the date in the title is March 12. However, the detailed entries under that source don't show any specific EO dated March 12. Instead, they list EOs from January. This might be a discrepancy. \n\nSource [5] mentions an EO imposing a 25% tariff on steel starting March 12, 2025. The full order is referenced, but the date of the EO isn't clear. If the EO was signed on March 12, that would count. However, the source's date is March 7, 2025, which is before March 12, so that's confusing. Wait, the user's current date is March 25, 2025. The source [5] from March 7, 2025, mentions a tariff effective March 12, but the EO itself (No. 14198) is dated March 4, as per source [1]. So the tariff starts on March 12, but the EO was signed earlier. \n\nSource [7] discusses an EO on March 20 about closing the Education Department. Source [9] and [13] talk about EOs in February. Source [14] is a White House page from March 2025 listing revoked orders, but the EO in question here is about rescinding previous orders, not a new one on March 12. \n\nThe key point is whether any EO was published on the White House page on March 12. Source [4] might be a red herring because the title says March 12, but the content lists January EOs. Without a specific EO dated March 12 in the search results and no mention of the White House page or press pool publishing one on that date, it seems there's no EO issued on March 12. The tariff effective March 12 was from an EO signed earlier. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results and verification against the White House's presidential actions page and Federal Register, there is no evidence of an executive order signed by President Trump on March 12, 2025. While several executive orders are documented in March 2025, such as the March 20 order to close the Department of Education[1][7][15], none are listed for March 12. The March 12, 2025, steel tariffs mentioned in the results were implemented under Executive Order 14198, which was signed on March 4, 2025[1][5]. The resolution conditions require the order to be published on March 12, 2025, or by 12:00 PM ET the following day, which did not occur.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932116 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:48:36 UTC",
