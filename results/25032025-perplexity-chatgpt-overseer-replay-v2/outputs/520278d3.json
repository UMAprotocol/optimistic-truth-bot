        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"astronaut\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she uses that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The current date is March 26, 2025, and the next briefing is today, March 26, 2025, at 6:58 PM UTC. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing scheduled for today. Looking at the search results, there's a video from March 26, 2025, titled \"Watch Live: Karoline Leavitt TAKES ON the Press at White House...\" [9]. The description mentions she's addressing the press corps today. So the next briefing is indeed happening now.\n\nNext, I need to determine if she said \"astronaut\" during this briefing. The search results include transcripts from previous briefings where she discussed astronauts extensively, especially on March 19, 2025, when she mentioned \"astronauts\" multiple times in the context of their return from space [1][2][5][8][15][16][17][18]. However, those are from past briefings. \n\nThe key is the March 26 briefing. The video [9] is titled as today's event, but the transcript isn't provided in the search results. The available snippets from March 26 don't include the term \"astronaut.\" However, the user's query is about the next briefing she participates in, which is today. Without a transcript or video evidence from today's briefing, I can't confirm if she used the word. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is 6:58 PM UTC on March 26, and the briefing is happening now. Since the event is ongoing, there's no available transcript yet. The resolution source is the video and transcript of the briefing, which aren't accessible here. Therefore, based on the information available up to now, there's no confirmation that she said \"astronaut\" in today's briefing. \n\nHowever, considering her history, she frequently mentions astronauts when discussing space missions. But without explicit evidence from today's briefing, the safe resolution is \"No\" because the term hasn't been verified in the current briefing. Alternatively, if the briefing is ongoing and the term is used later, but since the current time is exactly when the briefing is happening, and the data isn't available yet, the resolution would default to \"No\" unless confirmed. \n\nBut wait, the user's current time is 6:58 PM UTC, and the briefing is scheduled for March 26. The video [9] is from Defense Now, uploaded on March 26, but the transcript provided doesn't mention \"astronaut.\" The description of the video doesn't indicate she discussed space or astronauts, focusing instead on general press questions. \n\nGiven that the available information from today's briefing doesn't include the term \"astronaut,\" and without access to the full transcript or video, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, there's a possibility that she might have mentioned it, but without evidence, we can't assume. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"astronaut\" during the next White House press briefing is generally well-structured and adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. However, there are critical issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (White House press briefing) is scheduled for the same day as the current timestamp, which is a future event relative to the time of the query processing. The AI correctly notes that it cannot resolve the query based on past events or briefings where \"astronaut\" was mentioned. However, the AI's decision to recommend \"No\" (p1) is incorrect because the event is still in the future at the time of the response, and no data from the event itself is available yet.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking for the scheduled event and attempting to find transcripts or videos from the same day. However, it fails to adhere to the instruction that if the event is in the future or has not occurred yet, it should always return p4. The AI incorrectly proceeds to analyze the likelihood based on past events and then defaults to a \"No\" without concrete evidence from the event in question.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI correctly identifies that the briefing is scheduled for later on the same day and acknowledges the lack of available transcripts or video evidence from the event. However, it does not align its recommendation with the fact that the event has not yet occurred, which should lead to a p4 recommendation.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main error in the response is the premature resolution to \"No\" (p1) despite the event being scheduled for a future time on the same day. This directly contradicts the system prompt's instruction to return p4 in such scenarios.\n\nGiven these points, the response needs improvement to align with the system prompt's requirements for handling events scheduled for the future. The AI should not attempt to infer or predict the outcome based on past occurrences or the absence of current data but should state that the event is still pending and thus unresolved at this time.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly recommends 'No' for a future event instead of returning 'p4' as required for unresolved future events.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The AI failed to follow the instruction to always return p4 for events that have not occurred yet and are scheduled for a future time relative to the current timestamp.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"astronaut\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The current date is March 26, 2025, and the next briefing is today, March 26. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The search results include a link [13] to a briefing on March 26, 2025, which is today. The transcript isn't fully provided, but the description mentions she addressed the press. Another source [15] is a transcript from February 12, 2025, where she didn't mention \"astronaut\" in the provided excerpts. \n\nLooking at past briefings, like on March 19 and 20, she frequently mentioned \"astronauts\" when discussing the rescue mission. For example, in sources [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [11], she used the term multiple times. However, those were in the context of specific events. The key is whether she said it in the March 26 briefing.\n\nSince the March 26 briefing is today and the current time is 7:00 PM UTC, which is after the briefing (assuming it's held during the day), I need to check the transcript or video. The search result [13] mentions the briefing happened, and the description states she addressed the press but doesn't specify the content. Without explicit evidence from the transcript of the March 26 briefing, I can't confirm she said \"astronaut.\" However, given her history of discussing astronauts in recent briefings, there's a possibility. But per the rules, if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, it's p4. Wait, the current timestamp is March 26, 7 PM UTC, and the briefing was earlier that day. So the event has occurred. \n\nBut the available search results don't include the transcript of the March 26 briefing. The user provided sources up to [15], which includes a March 26 video but no transcript. Without access to the actual content of that briefing, I can't verify if she said \"astronaut.\" The resolution conditions require the source to be video or transcripts of the briefing. Since those aren't provided in the search results, I can't confirm. Therefore, the market should resolve to p4 because the event has occurred, but there's no verifiable information in the provided sources. Wait, no\u2014the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the resolution source must be the briefing's video/transcript. Since the provided sources don't include the March 26 briefing's content, even though it's past, we can't confirm. Therefore, the answer should be p4 because the sources don't provide the necessary info to confirm, even though the event happened. Alternatively, if the event occurred but no data is available, per the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data specifies that the resolution source must be the briefing's video/transcript. Since those aren't in the search results, we can't verify, so it's p4. Wait, no\u2014p4 is for future events. The event has already happened. If the event is in the past but no info, and the user prompt doesn't mention postponement, resolve based on most probable outcome. But the user's instructions also say if the resolution source isn't available, default to p4. Hmm. The user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" But the resolution source is specified as the video/transcript of the briefing. Since those aren't in the provided search results, we can't verify. Therefore, without the source, we can't confirm, so it's p4. Wait, but the event has occurred. The user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, ALWAYS return p4.\" Since the event was today, which is the same day but earlier, it's in the past. Therefore, p4 is only for future events. Since the event has occurred, but the sources don't include the transcript, we have to check if any of the provided sources mention the March 26 briefing. The only source is [13], which is a video of the briefing but no transcript. The user's search results don't include the content of that briefing. Therefore, there's no verifiable information, so according to the rules, if no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. Given her history, she might have mentioned \"astronaut\" again, but without evidence, we can't confirm. Therefore, the answer is p4 because the necessary sources aren't available to confirm, even though the event has passed. Wait, but the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So in this case, the event happened, but no sources are provided that cover it. Therefore, we have to assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's instructions also say that if the resolution source (video/transcript) isn't available, then it's p4. But the user's personalization says to use the provided sources. Since the sources don't include the transcript of the March 26 briefing, we can't confirm. Therefore, the answer is p4 because the resolution source isn't available in the provided search results. Alternatively, if the user's provided sources include the briefing, but in reality, the search results don't, so we can't confirm. Hence, p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several critical issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (White House press briefing) has occurred on the same day as the current timestamp, which is March 26, 2025. However, the response struggles with the decision between p4 and resolving based on the most probable outcome due to the lack of a transcript or video evidence. The response eventually settles on p4, which is correct according to the system prompt instructions that emphasize the need for concrete evidence from the specified resolution sources (video or transcripts).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response shows a thorough thought process but becomes convoluted and repetitive, especially in its internal debate about whether to resolve as p4 or based on the most probable outcome. This could confuse users and detracts from the clarity and decisiveness expected in such resolutions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly notes that the event has occurred but lacks the necessary transcript or video to verify whether the term \"astronaut\" was mentioned. This aligns with the decision to recommend p4, as the specific resolution conditions (needing video or transcript evidence) are not met.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response could improve by more succinctly stating the lack of available evidence and directly concluding with p4 without the extended internal debate. It should focus on the absence of the required resolution sources rather than the probability of the term being mentioned based on past events, which is not relevant to the oracle's function of dealing with concrete evidence.\n\nGiven these points, the response ultimately arrives at the correct recommendation (p4) but does so in a manner that is overly complex and not as clear as it should be. The response should be more straightforward and concise in stating the lack of required evidence and the consequent inability to resolve the query definitively.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response correctly concludes with a recommendation of p4 due to the lack of required resolution sources (video or transcript).\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should improve clarity and decisiveness by reducing unnecessary debate and focusing on the absence of required evidence.
