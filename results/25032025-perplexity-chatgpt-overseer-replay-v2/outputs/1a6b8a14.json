        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"reciprocal\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and \"Unknown\" (p3) if it's uncertain. The deadline is December 31, 2025, and if she's no longer Press Secretary by then, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing before the deadline. The current date is March 25, 2025, so there's plenty of time left until December 31. The search results don't mention any upcoming briefings specifically, but Leavitt has been holding them regularly, like the ones on January 29, February 12, February 25, and March 17, 2025. It's reasonable to assume she'll have more before the deadline.\n\nNext, I need to see if she's used the term \"reciprocal\" in past briefings. Looking through the provided sources:\n\n- In the March 18, 2025 video [10], she discussed upcoming reciprocal tariffs set for April 2nd. The term \"reciprocal\" is explicitly mentioned here.\n- The transcript from March 17, 2025 [9] also mentions \"reciprocal tariffs will go into effect.\"\n- Another mention on February 25, 2025 [5] where she states that 61% of Americans support the president's plan for reciprocal tariffs.\n\nThese instances show that \"reciprocal\" is a term she uses, especially in the context of trade policies and tariffs. The administration's focus on reciprocal trade deals, as highlighted in multiple briefings, suggests that this term is part of their standard talking points.\n\nThe query allows for any usage of \"reciprocal,\" including plural or possessive forms, but not other forms. The examples found are all the exact term \"reciprocal,\" so they fit the criteria. Since the term is part of current policy discussions (e.g., tariffs effective April 2), it's likely to come up again in future briefings.\n\nHowever, there's no information about the exact date of the next briefing. But given the frequency of her briefings (almost monthly), and the ongoing trade policies, the probability is high that she'll use the term again. Unless there's a significant policy shift or she stops being Press Secretary, which isn't indicated in the sources, \"reciprocal\" is likely to be mentioned.\n\nTherefore, based on past usage and the context of ongoing discussions, the recommendation is to resolve as \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt will use the term \"reciprocal\" during her next press briefing. Based on the evidence:\n\n- **Historical Usage**: Leavitt has consistently used \"reciprocal\" in recent briefings to describe trade policies, including plans for **reciprocal tariffs** targeting allies and competitors. For example, she confirmed on March 18, 2025, that \"reciprocal tariffs will go into effect\" on April 2[10], and earlier cited public support for \"reciprocal tariffs\" as a policy priority[5][9].  \n- **Contextual Relevance**: The term is central to the Trump administration\u2019s economic strategy, making its recurrence likely in future discussions of trade negotiations or enforcement actions.  \n- **No Indication of Cessation**: Leavitt remains active in her role, with no evidence suggesting she will leave the position before December 31, 2025.  \n\nGiven the term\u2019s established role in policy messaging and its repeated use in recent briefings, the probability of Leavitt saying \"reciprocal\" in a future briefing is high.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"reciprocal\" during her next White House press briefing is generally well-constructed and logical. However, there are critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure the response adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions and the nature of the UMA optimistic oracle system.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the term \"reciprocal\" and its relevance in past briefings. It also correctly notes the conditions under which the market will resolve to \"Yes\" or \"No.\" However, the response attempts to predict the likelihood of future events (i.e., the use of \"reciprocal\" in future briefings) based on past occurrences. This is speculative and not based on a verified fact of an event that has already occurred, which contradicts the system prompt's requirement for factual reporting on past or definitively scheduled events.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The reasoning provided is logical in the context of a predictive analysis but is inappropriate for the oracle's function, which is to report on factual occurrences. The response should not include predictive elements unless the event has already occurred and can be verified.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response fails to verify that the next briefing has occurred or to confirm the use of the term \"reciprocal\" within it.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Reciprocal\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the event in question is the next press briefing she participates in before December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any information about upcoming briefings. The search results provided include transcripts and news up to March 17, 2025. The latest mention of a press briefing is on March 17, 2025, where she discussed peace progress in Ukraine but didn't mention \"reciprocal\" in the provided excerpt. \n\nLooking at past briefings, Leavitt frequently used the term \"reciprocal\" when discussing trade policies, especially tariffs. For example, on February 20, 2025, she explained reciprocal tariffs as treating other governments the way they treat the U.S. [5][9]. There's also a mention of upcoming tariffs set for April 2, 2025, where she emphasized the administration's readiness to act on reciprocal tariffs [8][13]. \n\nHowever, the next press briefing after March 17 isn't detailed in the provided sources. The user's current date is March 25, so any briefing after this date would be in the future. Since the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, and there's no transcript available, we can't verify if she used the term. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the event hasn't happened by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". But here, the event is the next briefing, which is a future event relative to March 25. Even if there's a scheduled briefing, until it happens, we can't confirm the term's usage. Therefore, based on the guidelines, since the event is in the future, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the ancillary data specifies that if the event hasn't occurred by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's current timestamp is March 25, and the next briefing is after this date but before December 31. Since the next briefing is a future event, and we don't have information on whether it has occurred yet, the correct resolution according to the guidelines is p4 because the event is scheduled for a future date. \n\nWait, the user's current date is March 25, 2025. The next press briefing after this date would be in the future. Since the event (the next briefing) hasn't happened yet, the resolution should be p4. But the market's resolution deadline is December 31, 2025. However, the query is asking about the next briefing, which is a future event as of March 25. Since the system can't predict the future, and the event hasn't occurred, the correct recommendation is p4. \n\nBut looking back at the personalization instructions: If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since the next briefing is a future event, the answer is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, which is a specific future event. Since the system can't know if she will say the term in a future event, and the event hasn't occurred yet, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response correctly identifies that the next White House press briefing involving Karoline Leavitt, where she might say \"Reciprocal,\" is a future event as of the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). Therefore, it correctly concludes that it cannot resolve the query based on past or current data and recommends p4, indicating that the request cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nThe response is logically sound and complete in its reasoning. It correctly interprets the user prompt and ancillary data, understanding that any future briefing cannot be analyzed for the usage of the term \"Reciprocal\" until it actually occurs. The response also correctly navigates the guidelines that specify not to predict future events or outcomes but to report on verifiable facts of events that have already occurred.\n\nHowever, the response could improve in the following areas:\n1. It could benefit from a clearer and more concise explanation of why p4 is the appropriate recommendation without the repetitive reasoning about the future nature of the event.\n2. The response could emphasize more explicitly that it is adhering to the system prompt's requirement not to predict future outcomes but to focus on events that have already occurred.\n\nGiven the critical rule that a first attempt resulting in a recommendation of p4 must always be retried, and considering this is the second attempt, the response is satisfactory in its adherence to the guidelines and logical reasoning.
