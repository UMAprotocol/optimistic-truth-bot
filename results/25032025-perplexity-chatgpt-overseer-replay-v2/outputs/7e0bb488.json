The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Vegas Golden Knights on March 23, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Golden Knights win, it's p1 (Golden Knights), if the Lightning win, p2 (Lightning), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results all mention the game took place on March 23. Sources [1], [2], [3], [5], [7], and [8] confirm the date and the teams involved. So the game wasn't postponed or canceled, ruling out p3.\n\nNext, determining the winner. Multiple sources report the Golden Knights won 4-2. [1] states Vegas defeated Tampa Bay, [2] mentions a 4-2 win, [3] and [5] also confirm the Golden Knights' victory. The NHL's official site [8] and other articles all align on the 4-2 score in favor of Vegas. \n\nThe user also provided a current date of March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event has occurred. No sources indicate the game was rescheduled or canceled. \n\nTherefore, the resolution should be p1 (Golden Knights) as they won the game. The injury to Hertl mentioned in some sources doesn't affect the outcome, just the team's condition post-game. All conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Vegas Golden Knights occurred as scheduled on March 23, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. According to multiple verified sources, the **Vegas Golden Knights defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning with a final score of 4-2**[1][2][3][5][7][8]. Key details include:\n\n- The Golden Knights established a 3-0 lead in the first period with goals from Nic Roy, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hertl, and Jack Eichel[1][3][7].  \n- Tampa Bay\u2019s Nikita Kucherov scored a late goal with five seconds remaining, but Vegas secured the win with an empty-net goal by Nic Hague[1][8].  \n- The game was not postponed or canceled, and no evidence suggests irregularities in its completion[1][2][3][8].  \n\nSince the Vegas Golden Knights won the game, the market resolves to **p1 (\"Golden Knights\")** per the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907865 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:04:25 UTC"
