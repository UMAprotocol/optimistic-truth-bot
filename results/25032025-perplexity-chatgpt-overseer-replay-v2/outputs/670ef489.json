        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about the resolution of a UFC fight between Jan Blachowicz and Carlos Ulberg that took place on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Ulberg wins, it's p1; if Blachowicz wins, p2; and if it's a draw or unresolved, p3. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome of the fight. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [2] mentions that Jan Blachowicz lost to Carlos Ulberg via unanimous decision at UFC London on March 22, 2025. It states that Ulberg won by landing more strikes.\n- Source [3] from MMA Decisions confirms the unanimous decision in favor of Ulberg, with all three judges scoring the fight 29-28 for him.\n- Source [4] also reports Ulberg's victory, extending his win streak to eight, and notes the judges' scorecards were 29-28 across the board.\n- Source [5], the official UFC page, lists the co-main event result as Ulberg winning by unanimous decision.\n- Source [6] provides a detailed round-by-round breakdown, showing Ulberg won two rounds on two judges' scorecards and all three on another, leading to a unanimous decision.\n- Source [8] mentions Ulberg's win streak continuing with this victory.\n\nAll credible sources consistently report that Carlos Ulberg won the fight by unanimous decision. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. The resolution conditions state that the source should be ESPN, but a consensus of credible reporting can be used. Since multiple sources, including the official UFC site, confirm Ulberg's win, the market should resolve to p1 (Ulberg). No conflicting information is present, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nCarlos Ulberg defeated Jan Blachowicz via unanimous decision (29-28 on all three judges' scorecards) in their light heavyweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Edwards vs. Brady on March 22, 2025[2][3][4][5][6]. The fight was the co-main event at London's O2 Arena, with Ulberg outstriking Blachowicz 75-59 in significant strikes while effectively using jabs and leg kicks to secure the victory[2][4]. \n\nJudges David Lethaby, Vito Paolillo, and Ben Cartlidge all scored the contest 29-28 for Ulberg, despite Blachowicz's aggressive pressure throughout the fight[3][6]. This result extends Ulberg's win streak to eight consecutive victories and positions him for a potential title shot in the light heavyweight division[4][8].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909125 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:25:25 UTC"
