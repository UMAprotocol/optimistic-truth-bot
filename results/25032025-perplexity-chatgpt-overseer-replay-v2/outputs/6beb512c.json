        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the NBA game between the Miami Heat and Memphis Grizzlies on March 15, 2025. The key here is to determine the outcome based on the provided ancillary data and the search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, and the game was on March 15, so it's already happened. That means I need to verify the actual result of the game.\n\nLooking through the search results, several sources mention the game's outcome. Specifically, result [17] from ESPN states that the Grizzlies won 125-91. Another source [19] from Fox Sports confirms the Grizzlies' victory with a score of 125-91 and mentions they covered the spread. Additionally, [20] provides the box score, reinforcing the Grizzlies' win.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the Grizzlies win, the resolution is p1. Since the game wasn't postponed or canceled, and the Grizzlies clearly won, the correct resolution is p1. All sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. No future dates or conflicting information are present. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Miami Heat faced the Memphis Grizzlies on March 15, 2025, at FedExForum. The game concluded with a decisive **125-91 victory for the Memphis Grizzlies**[17][19][20]. Key performers included Jaren Jackson Jr. (31 points) and Desmond Bane (22 points, 10 rebounds), who led the Grizzlies to their seventh consecutive win, while the Heat extended their losing streak to nine games[17][19]. \n\nThe Grizzlies dominated all four quarters, never trailing, and covered the -7.5 spread[19]. The total points scored (216) fell under the 228 over/under line[19]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided, where a Grizzlies win corresponds to **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925210 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:53:30 UTC"
