The ancillary data specifies that if Baylor wins, it's p2; Mississippi State, p1; postponed stays open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. All the search results mention the game took place on March 21, 2025. No indication of postponement or cancellation. \n\nNext, determine the winner. Multiple sources [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] report Baylor won 75-72. The game was close, with Baylor holding off a late comeback. Key players like V.J. Edgecombe and Robert Wright contributed significantly. Mississippi State's Josh Hubbard scored 26 points, but it wasn't enough. \n\nCheck for any discrepancies. All sources agree on the score and outcome. No mentions of the game being canceled or postponed. The resolution conditions state a Baylor win is p2. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nBaylor defeated Mississippi State 75-72 in their March Madness first-round game played on March 21, 2025, as scheduled. The Bears held off a late Bulldogs rally, with freshman V.J. Edgecombe making crucial free throws in the final seconds[1][2][3]. Key details confirming the outcome:\n\n- **Final Score**: Baylor 75, Mississippi State 72[1][3][6]\n- **Game Flow**: Baylor led by 11 points in the second half before Mississippi State cut it to 71-70 with 29 seconds remaining. Edgecombe sealed the win with two free throws at 9.3 seconds[2][4][7].\n- **Verification**: Multiple independent sources including CBS Sports, AP News, and Baylor's official athletics site confirm the result[1][3][7]. Mississippi State's postgame notes also acknowledge the 75-72 defeat[8].\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation. Per the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to **p2 (Baylor)**. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
