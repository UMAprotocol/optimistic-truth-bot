        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Alabama State vs. Auburn game that took place on March 20, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Auburn wins, the market resolves to \"Auburn\" (p1), and if Alabama State wins, it resolves to \"Alabama State\" (p2). If the game was postponed or canceled, it would resolve differently, but the user provided the current date as March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so we need to check if the game occurred and who won.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results to find the outcome of the game. The search results include multiple sources, like CBS Sports, ESPN, and the official Auburn Tigers website. Let's check the dates to ensure they're relevant. All the game-related sources are from March 20 or 21, 2025, which aligns with the game date mentioned in the query.\n\nLooking at source [1], the headline states that Auburn defeated Alabama State 83-63. The article mentions Miles Kelly scoring 23 points and Johni Broome contributing 14 points and 11 rebounds. This clearly indicates an Auburn victory. Source [9] from ESPN also confirms the final score as 83-63 in favor of Auburn. Similarly, source [10] from the Auburn Tigers' official site reports the same score and highlights Kelly's performance. \n\nOther sources like [2], [3], [4], and [5] all consistently report Auburn's win with the same score. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the search results. All sources refer to the game as having taken place on March 20, with Auburn advancing to the next round. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and Auburn won decisively, the resolution condition p1 (Auburn) applies. There's no conflicting information in the sources; all point to Auburn's victory. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Alabama State and Auburn took place as scheduled on March 20, 2025, at 2:50 PM ET. **Auburn defeated Alabama State 83-63**, as confirmed by multiple sources including CBS Sports, ESPN, and Auburn's official athletics website[1][9][10]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Auburn's Miles Kelly** led scoring with 23 points, including seven 3-pointers, tying a program NCAA Tournament record[1][10].\n- **Johni Broome** added a double-double (14 points, 11 rebounds) for the Tigers[1][9].\n- Alabama State briefly challenged in the first half, cutting Auburn's lead to 32-31, but the Tigers closed the half on a 9-0 run and maintained control afterward[3][9].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required. Based on the resolution conditions provided (**p1 for Auburn win**), the market resolves to **Auburn**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response is tasked with resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of a specific event, the basketball game between Alabama State and Auburn on March 20, 2025. The AI's task was to determine the winner of the game and resolve the market accordingly, based on the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the game took place as scheduled and that Auburn won with a score of 83-63. This outcome is confirmed through multiple reliable sources, including CBS Sports, ESPN, and the official Auburn Tigers website. The AI correctly uses these sources to verify the event's occurrence and outcome, adhering strictly to the requirement to base its resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by verifying the game's occurrence on the scheduled date and confirming Auburn's victory. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which are absent, thus correctly applying the resolution condition p1 (Auburn win) as specified in the ancillary data.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI effectively verifies the event against the user prompt's conditions and aligns its recommendation accordingly. It ensures that the resolution recommendation (p1 for Auburn win) directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI does not exhibit any deviation from the expected analysis pathway and maintains a neutral and factual stance throughout the evaluation.\n\nGiven the thoroughness, accuracy, and adherence to the provided instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and reliable for resolving the UMA optimistic oracle request. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Auburn\" (p1) based on Auburn's confirmed win is appropriate and well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome based on reliable sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and logically aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event details and outcome, ensuring a high level of accuracy and reliability in the resolution recommendation.\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925196 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:53:16 UTC"
