The ancillary data specifies that if Wisconsin wins, it's p2; UCLA, p1; postponed stays open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 14 is definitely in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, several articles ([5], [10], [12], [15]) report that Wisconsin won the game 86-70. Specifically, source [5] from UCLA's official site confirms the loss, and [10] mentions Wisconsin's 19 three-pointers leading to their victory. TheScore's game details ([14]) also list the final score as 86-70 in favor of Wisconsin. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Wisconsin won, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Wisconsin Badgers defeated the UCLA Bruins 86-70 in their Big Ten Tournament quarterfinal game on March 14, 2025. The game occurred as scheduled at 2:30 PM ET at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, with Wisconsin establishing dominance through a record-tying 19 three-pointers (59.4% from beyond the arc). John Tonje led the Badgers with 26 points, including a perfect 6-for-6 from three-point range, while UCLA\u2019s Sebastian Mack scored a team-high 18 points[5][10][12][15].  \n\nNo evidence suggests the game was postponed or canceled. Per the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **p2** (Wisconsin win).  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response uses multiple sources to verify this information, including UCLA's official site and TheScore, which adds to the reliability of the resolution.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event is in the past and then proceeds to verify the outcome using reliable sources.

The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the event in question and using verified sources to confirm the outcome. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 is based on concrete evidence and established facts, as required by the system prompt.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Wisconsin vs. UCLA game using reliable sources, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and provides a clear, factual resolution based on the conditions specified in the user prompt.\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908348 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:12:28 UTC"
