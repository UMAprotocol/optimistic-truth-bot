The ancillary data specifies that if Louisville wins, it's p1; Stanford, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Checking the search results, multiple sources (1, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14) report that Louisville won 75-73. The key moment was Chucky Hepburn's buzzer-beater. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of postponement or cancellation. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed recaps. No indications of cancellation or postponement. \n\nSince the game was played and Louisville won, the resolution should be p1. All conditions are met, no conflicting info. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nLouisville defeated Stanford 75-73 in their ACC Tournament quarterfinal matchup on March 13, 2025, with Chucky Hepburn hitting a game-winning buzzer-beater[1][3][5][7][12][14]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any verified sources.  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- Final score: Louisville 75, Stanford 73[1][3][12]  \n- Game occurred at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, NC at 7:00 PM ET as planned[2][5][12]  \n- Louisville overcame a 15-point second-half deficit[1][3][7]  \n- Maxime Raynaud fouling out for Stanford proved pivotal[1][3][7]  \n\nNo evidence suggests the game was canceled or required a 50-50 resolution. The outcome meets the ancillary data's resolution condition for a Louisville win.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the requirement of verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through reliable sources, and it aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Stanford vs. Louisville CBB game) occurred on March 13, 2025, and that Louisville won the game. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, which is a good practice for verifying facts. The response also checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which aligns with the system prompt's requirement to verify the exact conditions of the event.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and outcome of the game, then verifying the absence of any postponement or cancellation. The details provided about the game, such as the final score, key players, and pivotal moments, add to the completeness and credibility of the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and provides a detailed account of the game, which matches the user prompt's description. The recommendation of \"p1\" for a Louisville win is correctly aligned with the ancillary data's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event details and outcome, ensuring accuracy and completeness.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927280 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:28:00 UTC"
