The ancillary data specifies that if VCU wins, it's p1; George Mason, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 16 is definitely in the past. That means I need to verify the actual outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources report the game's result. Source [4] from ESPN states that VCU won 66-63. Source [8] from CBS Sports confirms the same score, 66-63 in favor of VCU. Additionally, source [6] from the George Mason athletics site mentions the final score as 68-63 VCU, which might be a typo, but the key point is VCU's victory. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution should be based on the actual result. Since VCU won, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources agree VCU won, so the answer is clear. No need to consider future dates or cancellations. The recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe George Mason vs. VCU men's basketball game scheduled for March 16, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET was played as planned. According to multiple verified sources, **VCU defeated George Mason 66-63** in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament championship game[4][8]. The game was closely contested, with VCU maintaining a narrow lead in the final minutes and securing the victory through key free throws by Joe Bamisile with 0.5 seconds remaining[4][8]. \n\nNo evidence suggests the game was postponed or canceled. Both teams competed in the championship final as scheduled, with VCU claiming the conference title[4][6][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of event, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the George Mason vs. VCU game occurred on March 16, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. It correctly states that VCU won the game, aligning with the user prompt's conditions for resolution. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, which enhances its reliability.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It appropriately concludes that since VCU won, the market should resolve to p1, as per the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is not based on a single source, which could be erroneous. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There is no evident bias or errors in the response. The response does not omit any crucial information necessary for the resolution. It strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and uses verified sources to substantiate its findings.\n\nBased on the analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the verification of the event aligns perfectly with the ancillary data for resolution. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the George Mason vs. VCU game, correctly applies the resolution conditions, and uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the event's outcome.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively meets all required criteria for accuracy, logical reasoning, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
