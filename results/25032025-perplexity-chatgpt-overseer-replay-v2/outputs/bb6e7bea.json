The ancillary data specifies that if the Panthers win, it's p2 (Panthers), if the Islanders win, p1 (Islanders), and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 16 is definitely in the past. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. \n\nNext, I need to verify the actual outcome of the game. Looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [5], [8], [10], [12]) report that the Islanders came back in the third period to win 4-2. For example, source [1] states, \"Islanders come back with a 4-goal third period to beat the Panthers 4-2,\" and source [5] mentions the Panthers blowing a two-goal lead. The final score from the ESPN coverage in [7] also confirms the Islanders' 4-2 victory.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game as having taken place, with detailed accounts of the gameplay, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nThe resolution conditions say p1 is for the Islanders winning, which matches the outcome. There's no conflicting information in the sources, so the recommendation should be p1. No need to consider p3 since the game happened as scheduled.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Florida Panthers and New York Islanders on March 16, 2025, concluded with the **New York Islanders winning 4-2** after a four-goal third-period comeback[1][2][3][5][8][10][12]. Despite leading 2-0 entering the third period, the Panthers conceded four unanswered goals, including breakaway scores by Maxim Tsyplakov and Noah Dobson within 17 seconds[5][8]. Key details:  \n- **Final score**: Islanders 4, Panthers 2[1][7][10].  \n- **Game status**: Completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][3][8].  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1 (Islanders)**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between the Panthers and Islanders on March 16, 2025) is in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all confirm that the Islanders won 4-2. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where p1 corresponds to an Islanders win.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks whether the event date is in the past and then proceeds to verify the outcome of the game. It ensures that the game was not postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions provided in the user prompt for resolution. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, which strengthens the reliability of the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through reliable sources, ensuring that the game was completed as scheduled. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Islanders) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response adequately covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the conditions set in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925448 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:57:28 UTC"
