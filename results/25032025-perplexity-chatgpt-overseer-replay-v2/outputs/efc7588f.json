        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Philadelphia Flyers game on March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Flyers win, it's p1; Lightning win is p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the game's outcome. Looking at the sources, multiple articles mention the March 13 game. Source [1] is a CBS Sports recap titled \"Flyers end winless homestand with 4-3 shootout win over Lightning.\" The detailed recap states that the Flyers won 4-3 in a shootout. Similarly, source [4] from ESPN and source [7] also confirm the Flyers' victory in the shootout. \n\nAnother source [2] talks about a Lightning win on March 17, but that's a different game. The query specifically asks about March 13. The key here is the date. The March 13 game went to a shootout, and according to NHL rules, a shootout win counts as a regular win for the team. Therefore, the Flyers won that particular game. \n\nSince the Flyers won on March 13, the resolution should be p1 as per the ancillary data. The other games on different dates don't affect this specific market. No mentions of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning and Philadelphia Flyers played an NHL game on March 13, 2025, as scheduled. The game concluded with the **Philadelphia Flyers winning 4-3 in a shootout** after regulation and overtime ended in a 3-3 tie[1][4][7][8]. Key details:  \n- Bobby Brink scored two goals for the Flyers, while Owen Tippett and Matvei Michkov converted shootout attempts[1][7].  \n- The Lightning\u2019s Cam Atkinson tied the game early in the third period, but Tampa Bay failed to match Philadelphia\u2019s shootout performance[1][8].  \n\nSince the Flyers won the game, the market resolves to **p1** (\"Flyers\") per the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome is supported by multiple sources, and the response correctly applies the ancillary data rules to resolve the market as p1 (\"Flyers\").\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with a verification of the event's occurrence and outcome, followed by a detailed analysis of the game's key moments. It correctly disregards irrelevant games (e.g., the Lightning win on March 17) and focuses solely on the specified event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The details of the game, including key players and moments, are accurately reported, enhancing the credibility of the resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include any irrelevant or unverified information and stays focused on the event specified in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is justified.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931575 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:39:35 UTC",
