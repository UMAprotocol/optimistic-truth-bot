The resolution conditions are p1 for Flames, p2 for Avalanche, and p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14, so the event date is in the past. Now, I need to verify the game's outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Sources [1], [3], [4], [7], and [16] all report that the Avalanche won 4-2 against the Flames on March 14. For example, source [1] states, \"Parker Kelly scored twice, and the Colorado Avalanche held on to win 4-2 against the Calgary Flames.\" Similarly, source [16] from CBS Sports mentions the same score and outcome. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports discuss the game's details, including goals, assists, and player performances, which indicates the game was completed as scheduled. \n\nSince the Avalanche won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. The ancillary data specifies that p2 corresponds to the Avalanche winning. There's no conflicting information in the search results about the outcome, so the resolution is clear. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in the sources matches the user's query. All sources refer to the March 14 game between the Avalanche and Flames, so there's no confusion with another game. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche defeated the Calgary Flames 4-2 in their NHL game on March 14, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][3][4][16]. Key details from the matchup:\n\n- **Game outcome**:  \n  Colorado secured their 7th consecutive win (7-0-1 streak) with goals from Parker Kelly (2), Ryan Lindgren, and Valeri Nichushkin[1][4].  \n  Calgary's goals came from Blake Coleman and Jonathan Huberdeau[4][16].  \n\n- **Postponement/cancellation status**:  \n  No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in the search results. All sources confirm the game occurred as scheduled[1][3][7][16].  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions (Avalanche win \u2192 p2), this market resolves to **p2**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all confirm that the Avalanche won against the Flames with a score of 4-2. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where an Avalanche win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for the occurrence of the game, its outcome, and any potential postponements or cancellations. It confirms that the game was neither postponed nor canceled and occurred as scheduled. The reasoning is logical, following the steps outlined in the system prompt to ensure that the event matches the user's query and that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 is based on verified facts that the Avalanche won the game.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any deviation from the facts or the user prompt's instructions.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, and logical completeness of the response, the recommendation appears to be highly accurate and reliable.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources, adheres to the user prompt's instructions, and logically processes the information to arrive at a correct resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome and follows the system prompt's instructions meticulously, ensuring an accurate resolution.\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909860 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:37:40 UTC"
