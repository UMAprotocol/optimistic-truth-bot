The ancillary data specifies that if Vegas wins, it's p2 (Golden Knights), if Columbus wins, p1 (Blue Jackets), and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 13 has already happened. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] states Vegas won 4-0. Source [3] mentions Adin Hill's shutout for Vegas. Source [4] shows the final score as 4-0 for Vegas. Source [6] and [7] also report the 4-0 victory. Even though some sources like [2] and [5] predicted a Blue Jackets win, the actual result from the game day sources clearly shows Vegas won. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so the market should resolve to p2. All conditions are met, and the event occurred as scheduled.\n</think>\n\nThe Vegas Golden Knights defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-0 in their NHL game on March 13, 2025, at Nationwide Arena[1][3][4][6][7]. Adin Hill recorded a 27-save shutout, while Nicolas Roy and Brandon Saad each contributed a goal and an assist[1][7]. The Golden Knights scored twice in the first period despite being outshot 14-6, and added goals in the second and third periods to secure the victory[1][4][7].  \n\nThis outcome occurred on the scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the sources.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
