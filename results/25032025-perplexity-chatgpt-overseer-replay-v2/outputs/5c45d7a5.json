The ancillary data specifies that if Creighton wins, it's p1; if UConn wins, p2; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on or before the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 14, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [1][2][4][7] report that Creighton won the game 71-62. For example, source [1] states, \"Jasen Green and Jamiya Neal each scored 19 points in second-seeded Creighton's 71-62 win over No. 3-seed UConn on Friday in the semifinals of the Big East Conference Tournament.\" This is corroborated by other sources like [7], which mentions the final score and Creighton advancing to the championship game. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources confirm the game took place as scheduled with a clear result. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Creighton won, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in the query matches the sources. All sources refer to the same March 14 game between UConn and Creighton in the Big East Tournament, so there's no confusion with other events. \n\nNo conflicting information is present in the search results. Even though some pre-game predictions [8] favored UConn, the actual outcome is well-documented. Thus, the resolution is straightforward: Creighton won, so p1 is the correct recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe UConn vs. Creighton men's basketball game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET concluded with **Creighton defeating UConn 71-62** in the Big East Conference Tournament semifinals[1][2][4][7]. Multiple sources confirm Creighton maintained control after a strong first-half performance, led by Jasen Green's career-high 19 points and Jamiya Neal's 19 points[1][7]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game occurred. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided:\n- **Creighton (p1)** is the correct resolution. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
