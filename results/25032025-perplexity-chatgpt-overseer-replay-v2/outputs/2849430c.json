The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The user included several sources, but the key ones here are the ones related to the March 24 event. Looking at the search results, result [12] is a YouTube link titled \"President Donald Trump delivers remarks with Louisiana...\" scheduled for March 24 at 2pm ET. The description mentions Trump and Governor Landry speaking about education policies, but there's no mention of Zelenskyy in the title or description. \n\nResult [13] discusses a White House event on March 24 where Trump and Governor Landry were to announce a Hyundai investment. The article details the economic aspects and mentions tariffs but doesn't indicate any discussion about Ukraine or Zelenskyy. \n\nOther results, like [1] through [11] and [14] to [17], are about the February 28 meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, which is a different event. The user's query specifically refers to the March 24 event, so those earlier sources aren't relevant here. \n\nSince the resolution conditions state that only the scheduled event on March 24 counts, and there's no evidence in the provided search results that Trump mentioned Zelenskyy during that particular event, the answer should be \"No\". The Hyundai investment and education topics were the focus, not Ukraine. Therefore, the market resolves to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that the event in question is the one scheduled for March 24, 2025, and it focuses on verifying whether Donald Trump mentioned \"Zelenskyy\" during this specific event.\n\nThe response effectively uses the sources provided to determine that there was no mention of \"Zelenskyy\" in the context of the event on March 24. It correctly disregards other events and focuses solely on the specified event, aligning with the stipulation that only this event counts towards the market's resolution. The AI also correctly identifies that the topics discussed during the event were related to education policies and a Hyundai investment, which do not pertain to Ukraine or Zelenskyy, thus supporting the conclusion that Trump did not mention \"Zelenskyy.\"\n\nFurthermore, the response adheres to the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt by resolving the market to \"No\" (p1) based on the absence of the term \"Zelenskyy\" during the event. This decision is supported by the evidence provided and the specific conditions of the market resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has not made any assumptions beyond the evidence provided and has strictly adhered to the conditions specified for the event's resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it is accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the facts verified through the sources mentioned, and there is no need for a rerun or additional refinement.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzed the event based on the provided sources and correctly concluded that Trump did not mention 'Zelenskyy' during the specified event.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925425 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:57:05 UTC",
