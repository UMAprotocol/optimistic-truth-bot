The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Shauna Bannon vs. Puja Tomar fight at UFC Fight Night: Leon Edwards vs. Sean Brady on March 22, 2025. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already taken place. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the fight's outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [2] mentions that Puja Tomar lost to Shauna Bannon via submission (armbar) in the second round. \n- Source [3] provides the official result as Shauna Bannon def. Puja Tomar via R2 SUB (Arm Bar), 3:22.\n- Source [5] details how Bannon overcame a head kick to secure the armbar victory.\n- Source [6] lists Bannon as receiving a Performance of the Night bonus for her submission win.\n- Source [8] and [9] confirm the submission victory and Bannon's post-fight comments.\n- Source [15] also states Bannon's win by submission.\n\nAll these sources consistently report that Shauna Bannon won the fight via armbar submission in the second round. The ancillary data specifies that if Bannon wins, the resolution is p2. Since the event date is in the past and multiple credible sources confirm Bannon's victory, the correct resolution is p2. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nShauna Bannon defeated Puja Tomar via second-round submission (armbar) at UFC Fight Night: Edwards vs. Brady on March 22, 2025. The fight saw Bannon overcome adversity after being dropped by a head kick early in the second round, quickly transitioning to an armbar that forced Tomar to tap at 3:22 of the round[2][3][5][8][9]. This marked Bannon's second consecutive UFC victory and earned her a $50,000 Performance of the Night bonus[6][9]. The result was officially confirmed by multiple sources including ESPN and MMA Junkie[3][8][15].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930606 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:23:26 UTC"
