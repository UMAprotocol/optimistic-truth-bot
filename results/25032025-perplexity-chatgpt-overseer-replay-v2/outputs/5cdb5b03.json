All sources agree on a 5-1 victory for Washington. No mentions of postponement or cancellation. The game was completed, so no need for p3. Since the Capitals won, the resolution should be p2. \n\nCheck if any sources contradict this. All sources consistently report the Capitals' win. No conflicting information.

The response uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, which strengthens the reliability of the resolution. The AI has adhered strictly to the event in question without deviating to unrelated events or general information.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of the event and the alignment of the recommendation with the facts and ancillary data, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and provides a clear, well-reasoned recommendation based on the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934729 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:32:09 UTC"
