        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Hell\" five or more times during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes (if he did) and p1 for No (if he didn't). The updates mention that a video address counts, so even if it's pre-recorded, it's included.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit. Let's look through the provided sources. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's speech at the summit. For example, source [13] from Blockworks states that Trump addressed the summit on March 20. Source [14] mentions a recorded message. Source [15] and [16] also confirm his participation. \n\nNow, the key part is whether he used the word \"Hell\" five or more times. The search results include transcripts of previous speeches. For instance, source [6] is a transcript from a 2024 Bitcoin conference where Trump used \"hell\" multiple times. In that speech, he said things like \"to hell with the people\" and \"who the hell knows,\" which are examples. \n\nIn the 2025 FII Institute Summit (source [8]), Trump used \"who the hell wants to build units.\" Another speech in source [9] includes \"who the hell knows\" again. However, these are from earlier events, not the March 20 Digital Asset Summit. \n\nLooking specifically at the March 20 event, sources [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], and [17] discuss the summit but don't provide a transcript. Source [21] mentions the SEC roundtable but not Trump's speech. \n\nSince none of the search results provide a direct transcript or quote from the March 20 speech, there's no evidence that Trump said \"Hell\" five times during that specific event. The user's resolution conditions require video evidence, which isn't available in the provided sources. Therefore, based on the information available, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's note says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, the safe resolution is p4. Wait, no\u2014the resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the instructions say if the event occurred but no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization rules state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, and the user prompt specifies using the provided URLs, we must rely on them. Since the provided URLs don't have the transcript, and the event happened on March 20 (current date is March 25), but no sources confirm the count, the resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved). But wait, the updates say the video address counts, but without access to the video, we can't verify. Since the sources don't provide the transcript, and the resolution depends on the video, which isn't available here, the answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also say if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Given Trump's history of using \"hell\" in speeches (as seen in previous transcripts), it's possible he did, but without evidence, we can't confirm. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding whether Donald Trump said \"Hell\" five or more times during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, has been evaluated for factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, and completeness.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the need to verify whether the event occurred and whether Trump used the word \"Hell\" five or more times during his speech. The response adheres to the instruction to consider the video address as part of the resolution, as mentioned in the updates. However, the response fails to provide a definitive resolution based on concrete evidence, as required by the system prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by searching for transcripts and mentions of Trump's speech but fails to find direct evidence of the word \"Hell\" being used five times. The reasoning becomes somewhat circular and indecisive towards the end, reflecting uncertainty about whether to default to p4 or make an assumption based on Trump's historical usage of the word in other speeches. This shows a lack of completeness as it does not definitively resolve the query based on the specific event in question.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly notes that the event occurred on March 20, 2025, and that no transcript or video evidence is available from the provided sources to confirm the usage of the word \"Hell.\" However, it struggles to align this with a firm recommendation, wavering between different probabilities and outcomes.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main error in the response is the lack of a decisive recommendation based on the available information. The response also shows a bias towards assuming a probable outcome based on past behavior rather than sticking to the facts available for the specific event.\n\nGiven that this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, according to the critical rule, a RETRY is mandatory. The response could be improved by a more focused search for direct evidence from the event or a clearer rationale for defaulting to p4 based on the lack of available evidence.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response shows indecision and lacks a definitive resolution based on concrete evidence.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Hell\" five or more times during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution depends on video evidence of the main speech, including any Q&A immediately before or after. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key here is to find sources that mention the exact number of times Trump used the word \"Hell\" during that specific event. \n\nLooking through the search results, several sources mention Trump's remarks at the White House Digital Asset Summit. For example, sources [1], [4], [5], [9], and [11] all quote Trump saying phrases like \"Who the hell knows\" during his speech. However, these sources are dated March 7th, 8th, or 9th, which is before the March 20th event mentioned in the query. \n\nWait, the user's query specifies the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. But the search results mostly refer to a White House Crypto Summit held on March 7th. Source [3] mentions Trump speaking at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20th, but the content of that speech isn't detailed in the provided results. The other sources describe events from early March, not the March 20th event. \n\nThe user's ancillary data also includes an update that Trump's video address will count toward resolution. However, without access to the actual video or a transcript from March 20th, I can't confirm the exact number of times \"Hell\" was used. The existing sources don't provide evidence from the March 20th speech. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information, there's no verifiable evidence that Trump said \"Hell\" five or more times during the March 20th Digital Asset Summit. The cited sources refer to an earlier event. Without confirmation from the March 20th event, the recommendation should default to p4 (cannot resolve) as per the guidelines when future events or lack of evidence occur.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether Donald Trump said \"Hell\" five or more times during his March 20, 2025, Digital Asset Summit speech, with resolution dependent on verifiable video evidence. Analysis of the provided sources reveals:\n\n1. **Event Identification**:  \n   The search results primarily describe Trump\u2019s remarks at the **March 7 White House Crypto Summit** [1][4][5][9][11], not the March 20 Digital Asset Summit specified in the query. While source [3] confirms Trump\u2019s scheduled March 20 appearance, no transcripts or verified reports from that specific event are included in the provided materials.\n\n2. **Usage of \u201cHell\u201d in Prior Speeches**:  \n   At the March 7 summit, Trump used variations of \u201cWho the hell knows\u201d at least twice during his public remarks[1][4][9][11]. However, these instances occurred at a different event and do not apply to the March 20 speech in question.\n\n3. **Lack of March 20 Evidence**:  \n   No sources directly address Trump\u2019s March 20 speech content, and the provided updates do not clarify whether the term \u201cHell\u201d was used during this later event. The resolution conditions require confirmation via video of the specified speech, which is unavailable in the search results.\n\n4. **Temporal Context**:  \n   The current date is March 25, 2025, meaning the event has already occurred. However, without access to the video or corroborating reports from the March 20 summit, the outcome cannot be definitively determined from the provided data.\n\n**Recommendation: p4**  \n*(Insufficient evidence to resolve)*",

However, the response fails to provide a decisive recommendation based on the specific event and the evidence available, as it defaults to p4 without exhausting potential sources for the March 20 event.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the information from the sources it checked, noting that they pertain to a different event. However, the response lacks completeness as it does not demonstrate a thorough search for additional sources or transcripts that might provide direct evidence from the March 20 summit.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Hell\" five or more times during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution depends on verified instances of the term in the specified context. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of Trump's speeches, especially around March 20. The key sources here are [1], [2], [7], [13], and [15], which discuss Trump's crypto-related speeches and summits. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump using the phrase \"Who the hell knows\" during the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, 2025. For example, sources [1], [2], [7], and [13] all reference this exact phrase. However, the query specifically asks about the Digital Asset Summit on March 20. \n\nThe search results include [11], which is a preview article from March 20, 2025, indicating Trump was scheduled to speak that day. However, none of the provided sources after March 20, like [15] from March 25, mention the March 20 event's specifics. There's a mention in [11] about the summit, but no transcripts or direct evidence from the speech itself. \n\nThe user's updates state that the resolution source must be video of the speech. Since the provided search results don't include any transcripts or verified video evidence from the March 20 event, there's no confirmation of Trump using \"Hell\" during that specific speech. The instances cited are from earlier events in March, not the March 20 summit. \n\nTherefore, without concrete evidence from the March 20 Digital Asset Summit, the recommendation must default to p4, indicating insufficient information to confirm the required instances.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201chell\u201d during the **Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025**, cannot be definitively confirmed based on the available evidence. While multiple sources reference Trump\u2019s use of the phrase *\u201cwho the hell knows\u201d* during earlier crypto-related events, such as the **March 7 White House Crypto Summit** [1][2][7][13][15], there is no verifiable transcript, video, or direct reporting confirming the term\u2019s usage during the March 20 speech.  \n\nKey points:  \n- The March 20 summit was announced in preview articles [11], but no post-event sources in the provided search results include transcripts or direct quotes from Trump\u2019s remarks.  \n- All confirmed instances of Trump saying \u201chell\u201d relate to the March 7 event, where he used the phrase *\u201cwho the hell knows\u201d* while discussing Bitcoin policy [1][2][7][13][15].  \n- The resolution conditions specify that only statements made during the **March 20 speech or its immediate Q&A** qualify, and the resolution source must be video evidence. No such evidence is provided in the search results.  \n\nSince the event date (March 20) has passed and no conclusive evidence exists to confirm the term\u2019s usage during the specified speech, the recommendation defaults to **p4** (insufficient information).  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths but also some critical areas that need improvement to fully satisfy the requirements of the UMA optimistic oracle system.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question is the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, and focuses on whether Donald Trump used the word \"Hell\" five or more times during his speech. The response adheres to the instruction to base the resolution on concrete evidence such as video or transcripts from the event. However, the response does not confirm whether all potential sources (like video archives or official transcripts) have been exhaustively searched. This is crucial as the response defaults to p4 due to a lack of evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows from the lack of direct evidence from the event to the recommendation of p4. However, the response could be improved by explicitly stating whether all possible sources (like video platforms, news archives, or the event's official media channels) have been checked. This would strengthen the reasoning for defaulting to p4.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly notes the absence of direct evidence from the specified event and aligns the recommendation (p4) with this fact. However, it does not confirm that every potential source of evidence has been explored, which is a significant oversight given the importance of thorough verification in oracle systems.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main issue is the potential incompleteness in searching and verifying sources. The response does not mention checking video content directly or contacting the event organizers for official records, which are critical steps in ensuring that all possible evidence has been considered.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response still shows potential gaps in exhaustive verification, a further attempt could be warranted to ensure all sources have been thoroughly checked. This is especially important since the response defaults to p4, which should be a last resort after all avenues have been explored.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response needs to confirm that all potential sources of evidence, including direct video archives, official event transcripts, and media coverage, have been exhaustively searched before defaulting to p4.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response adequately follows logical reasoning based on the information provided but lacks confirmation of exhaustive search of all potential evidence sources.
