The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Seattle vs. Utah Valley college basketball game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Utah Valley wins, it resolves to p1; if Seattle wins, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event should have taken place. Checking the search results, multiple sources (1, 3, 5) report that Utah Valley defeated Seattle U 68-55 in the WAC Tournament semifinals on March 14. The AP recap (source 5) and the game highlights (source 1) both detail the score and key players, confirming the result. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no indication of postponement or cancellation. All sources mention the game proceeding as planned, with Utah Valley advancing to the championship. The house rules from sources 4 and 8 discuss scenarios for canceled or postponed games, but there's no mention of such issues here. Since the game was completed and the result is clear, the resolution should follow the outcome. \n\nThe ancillary data states a Utah Valley win resolves to p1. All evidence points to Utah Valley winning decisively. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nUtah Valley defeated Seattle U 68-55 in the WAC Tournament semifinals on March 14, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][3][5]. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with Utah Valley leading throughout and securing a decisive victory[1][5].

It verifies the outcome (Utah Valley win) using multiple sources, which is in line with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts. The response adheres to the instruction to report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and occurrence of the event, then verifying the outcome, and finally checking for any indications of postponement or cancellation. It concludes that the game was neither postponed nor canceled and that Utah Valley won, leading to a resolution of p1 as per the ancillary data provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through reliable sources and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the ancillary data conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is focused and strictly adheres to the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.
