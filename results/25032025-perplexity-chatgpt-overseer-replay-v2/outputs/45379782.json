        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Celtics vs. Jazz game scheduled for March 21, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Celtics win, it's p2 (Celtics), Jazz win is p1 (Jazz), postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [1] from ESPN has a detailed recap titled \"Celtics 121-99 Jazz (Mar 21, 2025) Game Recap\" with the date March 22, 2025, indicating the game happened the previous night. The final score is clearly stated as Celtics 121-99 Jazz. \n\nOther sources like [3], [4], [6], [7], and [8] all corroborate this result. They mention the Celtics' victory with scores like 121-99 and highlight key players' performances. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports discuss the game's events, player stats, and outcomes, which wouldn't make sense if the game didn't happen. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and the Celtics won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no conflicting information suggesting a different outcome or any cancellation/postponement. All evidence points to a Celtics victory, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Celtics defeated the Utah Jazz 121-99 in their March 21, 2025 matchup at the Delta Center, as verified by multiple game recaps and box scores[1][3][6][8]. Kristaps Porzingis led the Celtics with 27 points and 10 rebounds, while Jayson Tatum added 26 points in a game where Boston never trailed after the first quarter[1][6]. The Celtics dominated with 17 three-pointers and 26 points off turnovers, extending their winning streak to four games[1][3].\n\nKey factors in the outcome:\n- **Defensive pressure**: Boston forced 17 Utah turnovers leading to 26 points[3][6]\n- **Bench contribution**: Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser combined for 8 three-pointers[1][3]\n- **Third-quarter surge**: A 13-0 run after Utah closed to 71-69 sealed the game[1][6]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any verified sources[1][6][8]. As the Celtics won decisively, this market resolves to the predetermined outcome for a Boston victory.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933825 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:17:05 UTC",
