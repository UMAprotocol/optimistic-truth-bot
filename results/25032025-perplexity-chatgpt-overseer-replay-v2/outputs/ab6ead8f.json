The user wants to know if Louisville will make the 2025 Final Four, with the market resolving to \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on their advancement. The ancillary data specifies that if the team is eliminated, the market resolves to \"No\". The current date is March 25, 2025, and the Final Four is scheduled for April 5, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check both the men's and women's teams from Louisville. The search results mention both teams participating in the NCAA tournaments. \n\nFor the men's team (Louisville Cardinals), they were a No. 8 seed in the South Regional. They played Creighton in the first round on March 20. According to sources [3][9][12], Louisville lost to Creighton 89-75, ending their tournament run. Since they were eliminated in the first round, they can't reach the Final Four. \n\nLooking at the women's team (Louisville Cardinals), they were a No. 7 seed. They faced TCU in the second round on March 23. Sources [4][15][16] indicate that TCU defeated Louisville 85-70, eliminating them from the tournament. \n\nBoth teams have been eliminated before the Sweet 16, so neither can advance to the Final Four. The resolution conditions state that if eliminated, it's a \"No\". Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nThe University of Louisville's men's and women's basketball teams have both been eliminated from the 2025 NCAA Tournament before reaching the Final Four:\n\n**Men's Basketball**  \n- No. 8-seeded Louisville lost 89-75 to No. 9 Creighton in the first round on March 20, 2025[3][9][12]. This early exit eliminated them from Final Four contention.\n\n**Women's Basketball**  \n- No. 7-seeded Louisville fell 85-70 to No. 2 TCU in the second round on March 23, 2025[4][15][16], ending their tournament run.\n\nSince both teams were eliminated prior to the Sweet 16 and cannot advance further, the market resolves definitively to \"No\" under the stated conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively uses verified facts to determine the outcome of the market based on the elimination of both the men's and women's Louisville basketball teams from the NCAA tournament prior to reaching the Final Four. The response is logically sound, providing specific details about the games in which each team was eliminated and the dates these events occurred, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nThe response correctly identifies that the event in question (Louisville's participation in the 2025 Final Four) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, but it also correctly notes that the teams have already been eliminated from the tournament, allowing for a definitive resolution based on the conditions outlined in the user prompt. The recommendation of p1 (No) is appropriate given the elimination of both teams, as specified in the ancillary data where elimination leads to a resolution of \"No.\"\n\nThere are no missing information, biases, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the relevant parts of the event (the elimination of the teams) and disregarding any unrelated information. The response also aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data, ensuring that the recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the prompt instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the query based on verified facts and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses specific details about the elimination of the Louisville teams to provide a logical and fact-based resolution.
