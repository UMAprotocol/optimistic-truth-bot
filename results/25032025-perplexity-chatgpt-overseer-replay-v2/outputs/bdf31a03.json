        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Michigan vs. Texas A&M game scheduled for March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Michigan wins, the market resolves to \"Michigan\" (p2), and if Texas A&M wins, it resolves to \"Texas A&M\" (p1). If the game is postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 22) is in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]) report that Michigan defeated Texas A&M with a final score of 91-79. For example, source [3] states, \"Michigan is going back to the Sweet 16... Roddy Gayle's surge to beat Texas A&M 91-79.\" Similarly, source [12] from ESPN confirms the score as Michigan 91, Texas A&M 79. \n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention it took place on March 22. Therefore, the resolution should be based on the actual outcome. Since Michigan won, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Michigan\"). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources consistently report Michigan's victory, so there's no ambiguity. The resolution conditions are met, and the correct recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Michigan and Texas A&M occurred as scheduled on March 22, 2025, at Ball Arena in Denver. **Michigan defeated Texas A&M 91-79**[3][5][6][12], overcoming a 10-point second-half deficit behind Roddy Gayle's season-high 26 points (21 in the second half) and Vladislav Goldin's 23-point, 12-rebound performance[3][6][9]. The Wolverines outrebounded the nation's top offensive rebounding team 48-39[5][8] and closed the game on a 9-0 run after Texas A&M pulled within three points in the final two minutes[3][6].\n\n**Key factors in the outcome**:\n- Michigan's bench outscored Texas A&M's 37-26, led by Gayle and freshman LJ Cason (11 points)[9][10]\n- The Wolverines held Aggies' star guard Wade Taylor IV to 0/4 shooting in the first half[8]\n- Texas A&M missed 8 of its final 9 shots while Michigan went 8/8 from the free throw line in the final 1:29[6][11]\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation. Based on the resolution conditions defined in the ancillary data, the market should resolve to **Michigan** as the winner. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905158 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:19:18 UTC"
