The ancillary data specifies that if the Trail Blazers win, it's p1; if the Wizards win, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the game's outcome. Looking at the sources, [1] is an ESPN recap titled \"Trail Blazers 112-97 Wizards (Mar 17, 2025) Game Recap\" which clearly states the Blazers won. The score is repeated in the article, and they mention Anfernee Simons scoring 30 points. Source [4] and [5] are YouTube highlights from March 17, 2025, also confirming the Blazers' victory with the same score. Source [8] from ChampsOrChumps.us lists the last game between them on March 17 as a Wizards loss to the Trail Blazers 97-112. \n\nOther sources like [2] and [6] refer to a February 26 game, which the Trail Blazers also won, but that's a different date. The query is specifically about March 17. All relevant sources for that date confirm the Trail Blazers won. No sources mention postponement or cancellation, so the game happened as scheduled. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Trail Blazers). Need to make sure there's no conflicting info, but all March 17 sources agree.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Wizards faced the Portland Trail Blazers on March 17, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. According to verified game recaps and highlights, the **Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Washington Wizards with a final score of 112-97**[1][4][5][8]. Key performances included Anfernee Simons scoring 30 points for the Trail Blazers, while the Wizards' Alex Sarr led his team with 20 points[1][5]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up event was required[1][8].  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **Trail Blazers** (p1) as the outcome.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The sources cited (ESPN recap, YouTube highlights, and ChampsOrChumps.us) are used appropriately to confirm the game's outcome. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources to confirm the game's outcome. It correctly ignores irrelevant games (e.g., the February 26 game) and focuses on the specified date of March 17, 2025. The reasoning is clear and leads directly to the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Trail Blazers win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and system instructions, using only relevant and verified information to make the resolution recommendation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the UMA optimistic oracle request. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Trail Blazers\" (p1) is well-supported by the evidence provided and correctly follows the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the specified event, adhering strictly to the user prompt and system instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and makes a clear, well-supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929101 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:58:21 UTC",
