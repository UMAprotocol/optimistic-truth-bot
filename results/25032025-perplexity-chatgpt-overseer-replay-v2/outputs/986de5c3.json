The ancillary data specifies that if the Celtics win, it's p2; if the Heat win, p1; and if postponed or canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game in question (March 14) has already occurred. Now, checking the search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple results ([1], [3], [4], [6], [7], [11], [13], [15], [16]) explicitly state that the Celtics won the game on March 14. For example, source [1] mentions the Celtics' 103-91 victory, and [15] notes they covered the spread by winning by more than 8 points. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources agree on the Celtics' win. \n\nSince the game happened as scheduled and the Celtics won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Celtics defeated the Miami Heat 103-91 in their March 14, 2025 matchup, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][3][11][15][16]. This outcome occurred on the scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation. The Celtics' victory was highlighted by strong performances from Jayson Tatum (28 points) and Jrue Holiday (season-high 25 points), with Boston pulling away in the fourth quarter[1][3][11]. \n\nGiven the ancillary data's resolution conditions:\n- **p2 (Celtics)** is the correct resolution since Boston won the game\n- No evidence exists for postponement (p3) or Heat victory (p1)\n- The game occurred as scheduled with a decisive Celtics win\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
