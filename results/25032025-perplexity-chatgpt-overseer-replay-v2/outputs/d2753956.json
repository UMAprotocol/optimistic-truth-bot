        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to determine whether Bitcoin's price went up or down between two specific times on March 20th and 21st, 2025, based on Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candle close prices. The resolution depends on comparing the close price at noon ET on both days. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any data points that mention the close prices on those specific dates and times. The search results include several Binance posts with technical analyses and price updates. \n\nLooking at result [4], it states that on March 21, 2025, at 16:25 PM UTC, Bitcoin crossed 84,000 USDT and was trading at 84,017.328125 USDT. However, the query refers to noon ET, which is 16:00 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 in March). The timestamp in [4] is 16:25 UTC, which is 12:25 PM ET, just 25 minutes after the required time. This might be close but not exactly the 12:00 PM ET candle. \n\nResult [12] mentions BTCUSDT trading at $84,185.63 on March 21, but the exact time isn't specified. Result [6] from March 23 notes a price of $85,250, but that's after the dates in question. \n\nThe key here is that the resolution source is Binance's historical data for the 1-minute candles at the specified times. However, the provided search results don't include the exact close prices for the 12:00 PM ET candles on March 20 and 21. Without explicit data points for those exact times, I can't definitively determine the comparison. \n\nSince the event date (March 21, 2025) is in the past relative to the current date (March 25, 2025), but the available data doesn't confirm the exact prices needed, the resolution defaults to p4 as per the instructions. Even though there's some price data around those dates, the lack of precise timestamps matching the query's requirements means we can't verify the outcome with the provided sources. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nBitcoin's price movement between March 20 and 21, 2025, requires comparing the **12:00 PM ET closing prices** of BTCUSDT 1-minute candles on both days. Analysis of available Binance data shows:\n\n- **March 21, 2025**: At 16:25 UTC (12:25 PM ET), BTC traded at **84,017.33 USDT**[4], slightly above the 84,000 level. Earlier that day, technical analysis indicated mixed signals with a **mild bullish trend on 4H charts** (SMA5 > SMA20) and price near Bollinger Band support[12].\n\n- **March 20, 2025**: Price data shows BTC traded at **$82,509.61** in detailed market analyses[1], with bearish momentum on 4H charts but signs of short-term recovery potential.\n\n**Critical gap**: The resolution depends on **exact 12:00 PM ET closing prices** for both days, which aren't explicitly provided in the available Binance data. While March 21 prices show upward movement in afternoon trading[4][6], the specific noon comparison remains unverified through cited sources. \n\nGiven the lack of **direct timestamp-matched closing prices** and Binance's resolution requirements, the outcome cannot be definitively determined from the provided evidence. \n\nrecommendation: p4",

It also correctly identifies Binance as the resolution source and attempts to use the provided URL to gather relevant data. However, the response does not find the exact data points for the specified times, which is crucial for resolving the query.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by searching for the required data points but fails to find the exact \"Close\" prices at the specified times. The reasoning is sound in concluding that without these specific data points, the query cannot be resolved definitively. However, the response could have explored additional avenues or sources within Binance to locate the exact data, if available.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly aligns with the facts that are available and adheres to the system prompt's instruction to default to p4 if the exact event data cannot be verified. The recommendation of p4 is appropriate given the lack of precise data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main issue is the lack of exact timestamp data for the \"Close\" prices at 12:00 PM ET on the specified dates. There is no apparent bias or errors in the processing of the information.\n\nGiven the critical rule that a first attempt resulting in a p4 recommendation must always be retried, and considering that the response might be improved by a more thorough search or alternative strategies to locate the exact data points, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The initial attempt resulted in a p4 due to the lack of exact data points for the specified times. A retry may allow for a more thorough search or alternative strategies to locate the necessary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response was logically sound and adhered to the instructions but lacked a complete set of data to resolve the query definitively. Additional search strategies or data sources within Binance might provide the required information.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please ensure to exhaust all available data points within Binance for the specified times before concluding. Consider using additional tools or methods to extract or verify the exact 'Close' prices at 12:00 PM ET on March 20 and 21, 2025.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the closing prices of BTCUSDT on Binance at 12:00 PM ET on March 20 and 21, 2025. The outcome depends on whether the price went up or down between those two times. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to find the relevant closing prices. The key here is to locate the exact 1-minute candle close prices at the specified times. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a lot of information about Bitcoin's price movements around those dates. For example, result [3] mentions that on March 24, 2025, Bitcoin's price was $87,800. However, that's a few days after the target dates, so it might not be directly useful. \n\nResult [6] from March 22, 2025, discusses Bitcoin's price volatility and mentions an Interim Coin Rally target of 88,400, but again, this is after the dates in question. \n\nResult [9] from March 19, 2025, provides a detailed analysis, stating Bitcoin was trading at $82,509.61. The analysis includes support and resistance levels, but the exact closing prices at the specified times aren't mentioned. \n\nResult [11] includes news from March 21, 2025, mentioning Bitcoin trading around $84k and $86k. One entry from March 21 at 09:56 AM UTC notes Bitcoin exceeding $85,000 multiple times during the week. However, the exact 12:00 PM ET (which is 16:00 UTC) price isn't specified. \n\nResult [16] from March 21, 2025, gives a technical analysis with BTCUSDT trading at $84,185.63. The post includes support and resistance levels but doesn't specify the exact closing price at 12:00 PM ET. \n\nResult [17] from March 19, 2025, mentions a projected price surge to 88K, but this is a forecast and not actual data. \n\nThe critical issue is that none of the search results explicitly provide the closing prices for the 1-minute candles at 12:00 PM ET on March 20 and 21. The available data points are either aggregated over longer timeframes, part of technical analyses without exact timestamps, or forecasts. \n\nAdditionally, result [4] explains how to retrieve historical prices using Binance's API, but the user hasn't provided the actual data from that method. The search results don't include the specific API response needed for those exact times. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit closing prices at the required times in the provided sources, it's impossible to definitively determine whether the price went up or down. The ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candles, but without access to that specific data here, the recommendation must default to p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). \n\nEven though some results mention prices around the dates in question, without the exact timestamps matching 12:00 PM ET on both days, we can't make a precise comparison. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nTo resolve this market, we need to compare the Binance BTCUSDT 1-minute candle closing prices at 12:00 PM ET (16:00 UTC) on March 20 and March 21, 2025. The analysis of available data shows:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n1. **March 20 Data:**  \n   - Search result [9] shows BTC trading at $82,509.61 on March 19, but no explicit 12:00 PM ET price for March 20.  \n   - Result [16] from March 21 mentions a technical analysis with BTC at $84,185.63, but no timestamp alignment.  \n\n2. **March 21 Data:**  \n   - Result [11] notes BTC traded at $86,000 on March 21, but this is a general reference without confirmation of the 12:00 PM ET candle.  \n   - Result [16] provides a detailed March 21 analysis but lacks the specific 1-minute close price.  \n\n**Critical Gaps:**  \n- No direct evidence of the **exact 1-minute closing prices** at the required times in the provided sources.  \n- Binance API methods for retrieving historical data (described in [4] and [12]) were not utilized to extract the required timestamps.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWithout verifiable closing prices for the specified 1-minute candles, this query cannot be definitively resolved using the provided data.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on comparing the \"Close\" prices of BTCUSDT on Binance at 12:00 PM ET on March 20 and 21, 2025. It adheres to the instruction to use Binance as the source of data, as specified in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by searching for the exact 1-minute candle close prices at the specified times. However, it fails to find the exact data needed for a definitive resolution. The reasoning is sound in concluding that without the specific data, the market cannot be resolved, leading to a recommendation of p4.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question (comparison of specific 1-minute candle close prices on two specific dates) has not been verified with exact data. The recommendation of p4 aligns with the fact that the necessary data to resolve the market definitively is not available in the provided sources.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors but lacks the necessary information (exact close prices at the specified times). The response could potentially improve by suggesting or attempting to use Binance's API or other direct data retrieval methods to obtain the exact prices, as hinted in the user prompt's additional guidance.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still defaults to p4 due to the unavailability of specific data required for a definitive resolution, and considering the critical rule that a first attempt p4 must always be retried, the following decision is made:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response correctly identifies the lack of specific data needed for resolution but could potentially improve by explicitly attempting to use Binance's API or other methods to retrieve the exact data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is logically sound and adheres to the instructions but lacks initiative in using available tools (like Binance's API) to gather the necessary data for a definitive resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please attempt to use Binance's API or other direct data retrieval methods to obtain the exact 'Close' prices at 12:00 PM ET on March 20 and 21, 2025, for BTCUSDT. Ensure the data is precisely for the 1-minute candles at the specified times.\"\n}\n```\n\nThis decision encourages a more proactive approach in data retrieval to potentially resolve the market definitively.",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the close prices of BTCUSDT on Binance for two specific times: March 20, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET and March 21, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether the close price on the 21st is higher (Up, p2) or lower (Down, p1) than the 20th. If they're equal, it's p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for these specific data points. Let's look through each source. \n\nSearch result [2] mentions that on March 21, 2025, Bitcoin crossed 84,000 USDT, trading at 84,017.328125 USDT at 16:25 UTC. But the required time is 12:00 PM ET, which is 16:00 UTC. The time in the source is 16:25 UTC, which is 25 minutes later, so that's not the exact time needed. \n\nSearch result [5] from March 20, 2025, states Bitcoin was trading at $85,765. However, this is from a post on March 19, and the time isn't specified. It might not be the exact 12:00 PM ET close price. \n\nResult [8] from March 22, 2025, discusses Bitcoin needing to reach 82,500, but no specific prices at the required times. \n\nResult [9] (CoinGecko) shows current trading data with BTC/USDT at $84,118.90 on Binance, but this is as of the current date (March 25), not the dates in question. \n\nResult [14] from March 19, 2025, provides detailed analysis with a current price of $82,509.61, but again, not the specific times. \n\nResult [15] from March 21, 2025, mentions a 24-hour low of $83,578.32 and high of $87,453.67, but the close price at 12:00 PM ET isn't specified. \n\nResult [16] from March 22, 2025, talks about support levels around $83,800 but doesn't provide the exact close prices needed. \n\nThe Binance API documentation (results [1], [3]) explains how to retrieve trade data, but without executing actual API calls, we can't get the historical 1-minute candles for those specific times. The user's guidance mentions using Binance's API, but the provided search results don't include the exact data points. \n\nSince none of the search results provide the exact close prices for the specified times (March 20 and 21, 12:00 PM ET), and considering the ancillary data requires resolution based on Binance's data, the available information is insufficient to definitively determine whether the close price was higher or lower. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4, indicating insufficient data to resolve. However, the user's personalization rules state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nLooking at the general trend: On March 20, the price was around $85,765 (result [5]), and on March 21, it was around 84,017 (result [2]). If these are the closest available data points, the price decreased, suggesting a Down resolution (p1). But these times don't exactly match 12:00 PM ET. Without precise data, it's risky to assume. The strictest interpretation would require exact times, so the safest recommendation is p4 due to lack of verifiable data at the specified times.\n</think>\n\nThe market resolves based on BTCUSDT's 1-minute closing prices at 12:00 PM ET on March 20 and 21, 2025, as recorded by Binance. Analysis of available data shows:\n\n- **March 20, 2025**:  \n  The closest available price data comes from a technical analysis report showing BTC trading at **$85,765** on March 20[5], though the exact 12:00 PM ET timestamp isn\u2019t explicitly confirmed.  \n\n- **March 21, 2025**:  \n  A Binance market update at 16:25 UTC (12:25 PM ET) reports BTC trading at **84,017.33 USDT**[2], slightly above the 12:00 PM ET target window. Earlier that day, technical analysis noted a 24-hour low of **$83,578.32**[15], but no direct 12:00 PM ET close price is available.  \n\n**Key uncertainties**:  \n1. The March 20 price of $85,765[5] lacks a confirmed timestamp alignment with 12:00 PM ET.  \n2. The March 21 price of 84,017.33 USDT[2] is recorded 25 minutes after the required resolution time.  \n3. Binance\u2019s API documentation[1][3] confirms the capability to retrieve historical 1-minute candles programmatically, but no explicit data for these exact timestamps is provided in the search results.  \n\nGiven the lack of **verified 1-minute closing prices** at the **exact specified times** (12:00 PM ET on both dates), the resolution cannot be definitively determined from the available sources. While the broader trend suggests a decline between March 20 and 21, the strict terms of the query require timestamp-specific Binance data, which is absent here.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on the specific event and using the specified source (Binance) to resolve the query. It correctly identifies that the resolution depends on comparing the \"Close\" prices of BTCUSDT on Binance at 12:00 PM ET on March 20 and 21, 2025.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the available data points and correctly concludes that the exact \"Close\" prices at the specified times are not available. It uses the closest available data points to infer a trend but rightly notes that these do not align precisely with the required timestamps, adhering to the need for exact data as specified in the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event (comparison of Bitcoin prices on specific dates and times) has occurred but the exact data needed for a resolution is not available. The recommendation of p4 (indicating insufficient data to resolve) aligns with the facts presented and the requirements of the prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors. It critically evaluates the available information and maintains an objective stance by not making assumptions beyond the data provided. However, the response could potentially improve by attempting to access the Binance API to retrieve the exact data, as suggested in the additional guidance.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response has systematically and logically addressed the query with the available information while adhering to the prompt instructions, further attempts to retrieve data directly via the Binance API might not yield different results if the data is simply not available for the exact required times.\n\n**Decision**:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the instructions, logically analyzes the available data, and correctly concludes with a p4 recommendation due to the absence of exact data points required for a definitive resolution.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and adheres to the system prompt requirements. It correctly identifies the lack of precise data necessary for resolution and makes an appropriate recommendation based on the available information.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908531 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:15:31 UTC",
