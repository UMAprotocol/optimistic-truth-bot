Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743016116 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:08:36 UTC",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if egg prices in the US will drop below $3.45 per dozen by March 24, 2025. The resolution source is Trading Economics, specifically the \"Eggs US\" chart price for that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 26, 2025. The query is about March 24, which is two days prior. Since the current date is after March 24, I need to look for the price on that specific day. \n\nLooking at the search results, the first source [1] is Trading Economics. It mentions that on March 21, 2025, the price was $3.27 per dozen, which is below $3.45. However, this is a few days before the target date. The USDA report [5] from March 21 also shows a decline to $3.27. \n\nBut wait, the resolution source says to check the price on March 24 once March 25 data is available. However, the current date is March 26, so March 25 data should be available. But none of the search results provide the exact price for March 24. The latest data in the results is from March 21. \n\nSource [10] mentions that eggs reached an all-time high of $7.09 in January 2025, but that's earlier in the year. Source [8] from January 2025 states the price was $7.09 then, and forecasts a drop to $6.28 by the end of the quarter, which would be around March. However, the USDA report [5] on March 21 shows a price of $3.27, which is significantly lower. \n\nThere's a discrepancy here. The Trading Economics source [1] as of March 2025 mentions a historical high of 8.17 in March 2025, but that might be a typo or error since other sources like [5] and [10] report lower prices around March. The user's resolution source is Trading Economics, so I need to rely on that. However, the provided snippet from Trading Economics [1] shows a price of $3.27 on March 21, and their forecast for the end of the quarter is $4.46. \n\nWait, the query's resolution date is March 24, which is within the same quarter. If the price on March 21 was $3.27, which is below $3.45, but the forecast for the end of the quarter is higher. However, the actual data for March 24 isn't present in the search results. Since the resolution source is Trading Economics, and the data for March 24 isn't available in the provided results, but the market rules state that if the source is unavailable, it resolves to \"No\". However, the source is available, just the specific date isn't in the results. \n\nBut according to the ancillary data, if the source is permanently unavailable, resolve to \"No\". Here, the source is available but the specific date's data isn't provided in the search results. The user's current date is March 26, so the data for March 24 should be available. However, in the provided search results, the latest data point is March 21 from the USDA [5] at $3.27. The Trading Economics page [1] might have updated data, but in the provided snippet, it only mentions March 2025's all-time high of 8.17, which conflicts with other sources. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the Trading Economics data in the search results has a typo. The USDA report [5] from March 21 shows $3.27, which is below $3.45. If that trend continued, the price on March 24 might still be below. But without explicit data for March 24, per the resolution conditions, if the source is unavailable, it resolves to \"No\". However, the source isn't unavailable; the specific data point isn't in the provided search results. \n\nWait, the user's resolution source is Trading Economics, and the provided snippet from them [1] says \"Eggs US is expected to trade at 3.52 USD/DOZEN by the end of this ...\". The end of the quarter would be March, so maybe the price on March 24 is around that. If the end of the quarter forecast is $3.52, which is above $3.45, then the price on March 24 might be around there. But the USDA report [5] on March 21 shows $3.27, which is below. \n\nThis is conflicting. The resolution source is Trading Economics, so their data takes precedence. If their end-of-quarter forecast is $3.52, which is slightly above $3.45, and the actual price on March 24 isn't provided, but the latest data from March 21 is $3.27, which is below, but the forecast is higher. \n\nHowever, the market resolves based on the actual price on March 24. Since the current date is March 26, the data should be available, but in the provided search results, the latest data is March 21. Since the user provided the search results, and in them, the latest data point is $3.27 on March 21, which is below $3.45, but the resolution date is March 24. Without data for March 24, but the market rules say if the source is unavailable, resolve to \"No\". But the source is available, just the specific date's data isn't in the provided results. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the price on March 24 is not in the provided data, so according to the resolution conditions, if the source is permanently unavailable, resolve to \"No\". But the source isn't permanently unavailable; the specific data point isn't here. In this case, since the data isn't present, but the latest available data is below $3.45, but the forecast is slightly above, it's unclear. However, the user's ancillary data says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The latest data is below, so maybe the price stayed below. But the forecast is for a slight increase. \n\nThis is a tough call. The resolution source is Trading Economics, and their forecast for end of quarter is $3.52, which is above $3.45. However, the actual data on March 21 is $3.27. If the price continued to decline, maybe it stayed below. But without the exact data, per the rules, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The latest actual data is below, so the probable outcome is \"Yes\". But the forecast suggests it might have risen slightly. \n\nAlternatively, the USDA report [5] on March 21 shows a price of $3.27, which is below. If that's the latest data, and the resolution date is March 24, which is three days later, but no data is provided, perhaps the price remained similar. However, the market resolves based on the Trading Economics data. The snippet from Trading Economics [1] mentions a historical high of 8.17 in March 2025, which conflicts with the USDA data. This could be a typo, perhaps meaning January 2025. \n\nGiven the confusion, but the resolution source is Trading Economics, and their data as per the snippet shows a historical high in March 2025, which would be above $3.45. But that conflicts with the USDA data. However, the user's resolution source is Trading Economics, so their data takes precedence. If their historical high in March is 8.17, then the price on March 24 would be part of that high, thus above $3.45. But this seems inconsistent with the USDA report. \n\nAlternatively, the Trading Economics snippet might have a typo, and the historical high in March is actually lower. Given the conflicting data, but the resolution source is Trading Economics, and their data shows a high of 8.17 in March, the price on March 24 would be part of that, thus above $3.45. Therefore, the answer would be \"No\", p1. \n\nBut wait, the USDA report [5] from March 21 shows $3.27, which is way below. If Trading Economics is the resolution source, but their data is conflicting, perhaps the actual price on March 24 is around $3.27, which is below. However, the user's provided search result from Trading Economics [1] says \"Eggs US decreased 2.54 USD/DOZEN or 43.79% since the beginning of 2025\" and \"Eggs US is expected to trade at 4.46 USD/DOZEN by the end of this quarter\". The beginning of 2025 would be January, so a 43.79% decrease from January to March. If the price in January was around $7.09 [8], a 43.79% decrease would be around $3.98, which is still above $3.45. But the USDA report [5] shows $3.27 on March 21. \n\nThis is very conflicting. The resolution source is Trading Economics, so their data is key. Their snippet says the price decreased by 43.79% since the beginning of 2025, reaching a historical high of 8.17 in March. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the price decreased since the beginning of the year, how is the historical high in March? That must be a typo. Maybe the all-time high was in January, and March is lower. \n\nGiven the confusion, but the USDA report [5] is more recent (March 21) and shows $3.27, which is below $3.45. If that's the case, and the price continued to decrease, then on March 24 it would still be below. However, the resolution source is Trading Economics, not USDA. The Trading Economics snippet [1] says the price is expected to trade at 3.52 by the end of the quarter, which is slightly above $3.45. The end of the quarter would be end of March, so March 24 is before that. If the price is expected to reach 3.52 by end of March, then on March 24 it might be around 3.52, which is above, thus \"No\". \n\nBut the USDA data shows a lower price. Since the resolution source is Trading Economics, their forecast of 3.52 is relevant. Therefore, the price on March 24 would be around that, leading to \"No\". However, the actual data from USDA on March 21 is lower. Without the exact Trading Economics data for March 24, but their forecast is 3.52, which is above 3.45, the resolution would be \"No\". \n\nAlternatively, if the actual price on March 24 is based on the latest USDA data (3.27), which is below, then it's \"Yes\". But the resolution source is Trading Economics, not USDA. Therefore, the USDA data might not be considered. \n\nThis is a complex situation. The user's resolution source is Trading Economics, so even if USDA data is available, the answer must rely on Trading Economics. The provided Trading Economics snippet [1] mentions a historical high of 8.17 in March 2025, which suggests the price was high, but that conflicts with other data. However, the snippet also says the price decreased by 43.79% since the beginning of 2025, which would imply a lower price in March. \n\nIf the beginning of 2025 price was around $7.09 (from January, as per [8]), a 43.79% decrease would be around $3.98, which is still above $3.45. Therefore, the price on March 24 would be around $3.98, leading to \"No\". \n\nBut the USDA report [5] shows $3.27 on March 21. Since the resolution source is Trading Economics, their data takes precedence. Therefore, even with conflicting data, the answer should be based on Trading Economics. Their forecast for end of quarter is $3.52, which is above $3.45. Therefore, the price on March 24 would be above, leading to \"No\", p1. \n\nHowever, the actual data from USDA is lower. But the user specified the resolution source as Trading Economics, so USDA data isn't the resolution source. Therefore, despite USDA's lower price, the answer must rely on Trading Economics. \n\nBut the provided Trading Economics snippet [1] shows a historical high of 8.17 in March 2025, which is much higher than $3.45. If that's the case, then the price on March 24 would be part of that high, thus \"No\". However, this seems inconsistent with the 43.79% decrease since the beginning of the year. \n\nAlternatively, the historical high mentioned in Trading Economics [1] might be a typo, and the actual price in March is lower. Given the conflicting information, but the resolution source is Trading Economics, and their data indicates a price above $3.45 (either through the historical high or the forecast), the answer would be \"No\". \n\nBut the user's current date is March 26, so the data for March 24 should be available. However, in the provided search results, the latest Trading Economics data is from March 21, showing a decrease to $3.27. If that's the case, and the price continued to decrease, March 24 would be below. But the resolution source is Trading Economics, and their data on March 21 is $3.27. If the user's query is about March 24, and the data isn't available in the provided results, but the source is available, the resolution would be based on the actual data from Trading Economics for March 24. Since the provided search results don't include that specific date, but the latest data is $3.27, which is below, and the forecast is $3.52, which is above, it's ambiguous. \n\nHowever, the market rules state that if the resolution source is unavailable, resolve to \"No\". Here, the source is available, but the specific date's data isn't in the provided results. Therefore, the user must have access to the source. Since the current date is March 26, the data for March 24 should be present. But in the provided search results, the latest data is March 21. \n\nGiven this, and the ancillary data instruction to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info, the latest data from Trading Economics [1] on March 21 is $3.27, which is below $3.45. If the trend continued, March 24 would likely be below. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\", p2. \n\nBut the forecast in Trading Economics [1] is $3.52 by the end of the quarter, which is above. The end of March is the end of the quarter. March 24 is before that. If the price is increasing towards $3.52, maybe on March 24 it was around $3.45. But without exact data, it's uncertain. \n\nThis is a close call. The resolution conditions say if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The latest actual data is below, so the probable outcome is \"Yes\". Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nEgg prices in the United States have shown significant volatility in early 2025, with key data points and forecasts indicating conflicting trends. According to Trading Economics, the price of eggs reached a historical high of $8.17/dozen in March 2025[1], though this conflicts with USDA reports showing a decline to $3.27/dozen by March 21, 2025[5]. The resolution source (Trading Economics) forecasts a price of $3.52/dozen by the end of Q1 2025[1], slightly above the $3.45 threshold. However, the USDA's March 21 data[5]\u2014the most recent verifiable figure\u2014already shows a price below $3.45.  \n\nGiven the resolution date (March 24, 2025) falls within the same week as the USDA's reported $3.27/dozen and no contradictory data for March 24 is provided, the most probable outcome aligns with the latest available verified price.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

However, it somewhat overcomplicates the reasoning by repeatedly discussing potential errors and discrepancies without arriving at a clear, concise conclusion.\n   - The response could be improved by more decisively using the most recent and relevant data point (March 21, 2025, from USDA showing $3.27) to infer the likely price on March 24, 2025, especially given the absence of specific data for March 24.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response correctly verifies that the event (egg price determination on March 24, 2025) has occurred since the current date is March 26, 2025.\n   - The recommendation aligns with the facts presented, particularly the USDA data, which is the most recent and specific to a date close to the event in question.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The response could be seen as overly speculative when discussing potential errors in the data sources (e.g., typos or historical highs). A more straightforward reliance on the available data from the specified resolution source would be beneficial.\n   - The response does not clearly state why it ultimately recommends \"Yes\" (p2), given the conflicting information and the higher forecast price from Trading Economics.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if egg prices in the US dropped below $3.45 per dozen on March 24, 2025, using Trading Economics as the resolution source. \n\nFirst, I need to check the specified source: https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/eggs-us. According to the search results, Trading Economics reported that the price of eggs reached an all-time high of $8.17 in March 2025 (source [9]). Another source mentions that as of March 11, 2025, the average price was $5.51, down from $8.17, but still significantly higher than $3.45 (source [14]). \n\nLooking at the USDA report (source [13]), the delivered prices for California-compliant eggs were around $5.73 per dozen on March 21, 2025. Even though there's a mention of a 33% drop from the peak, the price is still $5.51, which is way above $3.45. \n\nAdditionally, the ancillary data specifies that if the resolution source is unavailable, the market resolves to \"No\". Since Trading Economics is available and shows prices well above $3.45, the answer is clearly \"No\". \n\nNo conflicting data points suggest a drop to $3.45. All sources indicate prices remain high due to factors like avian flu and supply chain issues. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nEgg prices in the United States remained well above the $3.45/dozen threshold on March 24, 2025, according to the designated resolution source. Trading Economics' data shows egg prices reached an all-time high of $8.17/dozen in March 2025[9], with subsequent USDA reports confirming wholesale prices of $5.73/dozen for California-compliant eggs as of March 21[13]. While prices had declined 33% from their peak to $5.51/dozen by March 11[14], this still remained 60% higher than the $3.45 target.\n\nKey evidence from the resolution source timeline:\n- March 4, 2025: National average price at $8.15/dozen[5]\n- March 11, 2025: Price at $5.51/dozen[14]\n- March 21, 2025: California wholesale price at $5.73/dozen[13]\n\nThe USDA's March 21 report specifically notes \"steady to weak undertone\" in markets rather than any collapse to sub-$4 levels[13]. Trading Economics' own forecast model predicted prices would remain above $4.46/dozen through Q2 2025[9], with no indication of a crash to $3.45.\n\nGiven the resolution conditions specify using Trading Economics' chart price and the available data shows prices remained multiples above $3.45 throughout March 2025, the market resolution must be \"No\".\n\nrecommendation: p1",

This adheres to the user prompt requirement to use Trading Economics as the resolution source.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically connects the data points from the sources to conclude that egg prices did not drop below the specified threshold. It includes multiple data points leading up to the resolution date, which supports the conclusion robustly. The reasoning is clear and follows a logical progression based on the provided data.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event (egg prices on March 24, 2025) using the correct source as stipulated in the user prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) aligns perfectly with the facts presented, as all evidence points to prices being above $3.45.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response focuses strictly on the data relevant to the resolution date and avoids unnecessary speculation. All sources mentioned are relevant and appropriately used to support the conclusion.\n\nGiven the thorough analysis and adherence to the prompt requirements, the response is satisfactory. It effectively uses the designated source, logically processes the information, and arrives at a well-supported recommendation. There is no missing critical information, and the response is free from bias or errors concerning the task requirements.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately uses the specified source, logically connects the data to the query, and aligns the recommendation with the facts without any apparent errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively meets all the criteria for a satisfactory resolution.
