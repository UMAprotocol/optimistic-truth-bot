The ancillary data specifies that if Akron wins, it's p1; Miami (OH) is p2, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened 10 days ago. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game's result. Source [1] shows Akron won 76-74. Source [7] from CBS Sports and AP details Akron's comeback victory, with Nate Johnson hitting the game-winning shot. Source [8] from the Miami student newspaper also confirms the 76-74 loss to Akron. Additionally, ESPN's box score in [10] lists the final score as Akron 76, Miami (OH) 74. \n\nAll these sources consistently report Akron as the winner. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Akron). I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align. The answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Miami (OH) vs. Akron men's basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET concluded with **Akron defeating Miami (OH) 76-74** in the Mid-American Conference Tournament championship[1][7][8][10]. The game featured a dramatic comeback by Akron, who erased an 18-point first-half deficit and secured the win on Nate Johnson's game-winning jumper with two seconds remaining[7][8]. No evidence suggests the game was postponed or canceled, as all sources confirm the completion of the contest.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905678 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:27:58 UTC"
