        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Iowa vs. Ohio State men's basketball game played on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Iowa wins, it resolves to p2 (\"Iowa\"), and if Ohio State wins, p1 (\"Ohio State\"). The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the game's outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] from elevenwarriors.com states that Ohio State lost to Iowa 77-70 in the Big Ten Tournament on March 12, 2025. The detailed stats and game recap support this.\n- Source [2] from hawkeyesports.com also reports Iowa's victory over Ohio State with the same score, 77-70, in the men's basketball tournament opener.\n- Source [3] on sportytrader.com lists the final score as 70-77 in favor of Iowa.\n- Source [5] is a duplicate of [2], reinforcing the result.\n- Sources [7] and [8] discuss Ohio State's NCAA Tournament hopes being dashed after the loss to Iowa, confirming the outcome.\n\nAll relevant sources agree that Iowa won the game. The women's game mentioned in [4] is a different event and can be disregarded. The YouTube video in [6] also discusses the men's game, corroborating Iowa's win.\n\nSince the event occurred on March 12, which is before the current date, and all credible sources confirm Iowa's victory, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Iowa\"). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Iowa Hawkeyes defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes 77-70 in the men's basketball Big Ten Tournament game on March 12, 2025[1][2][3][5][7][8]. The game was part of the opening round of the tournament, with 15th-seeded Iowa overcoming 10th-seeded Ohio State. Key moments included a decisive 7-0 Iowa run late in the second half and a dagger 3-pointer by Brock Harding with 15 seconds remaining to seal the victory[1][2][7].  \n\n**Game Highlights**  \n- **Final Score**: Iowa 77, Ohio State 70[1][2][3]  \n- **Top Performers**:  \n  - Iowa: Payton Sandfort (17 points), Josh Dix (16 points), Brock Harding (15 points)[2][5]  \n  - Ohio State: Bruce Thornton (24 points, 9 assists), Devin Royal (14 points)[1][7]  \n- **Critical Sequence**: With 3:37 left, Iowa used a 7-0 run during a 3:48 Ohio State scoring drought to take a 68-61 lead, which proved insurmountable[1][2][8].  \n\nThe outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided, as Iowa\u2019s victory triggers a resolution to \"Iowa\" (p2). The game was completed as scheduled, with no indication of postponement or cancellation[1][2][3].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934192 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:23:12 UTC"
