        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if anyone audibly farted during the main stage of the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, ET, as captured on livestreams or official recordings. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of a fart during the event. Looking through the sources, result [5] from Protos.com directly addresses this. It mentions a Polymarket bet where participants are debating whether a fart occurred after Trump's speech. The article notes an alleged fart at timestamp 2:38:10 in the livestream, right after Trump's pre-recorded speech ended. However, there's ambiguity\u2014some think it's a fart, others suggest it could be a chair scraping or leather noise. The panelists were on leather chairs, which adds to the uncertainty.\n\nOther sources like [9], [10], and [11] also reference the fart debate but don't provide additional evidence. The key point is whether the sound was clearly a fart. The resolution source is the official recordings, so I need to check if the event's official channels confirmed it. None of the sources indicate an official confirmation, just speculation among bettors. \n\nSince the market resolves based on clear evidence from official sources, and there's no confirmation, the resolution should lean towards the available evidence. The sound exists but isn't definitively a fart. However, the market's terms state it resolves to Yes if the fart is clearly captured. Without official confirmation, it's uncertain. But the user's ancillary data says p3 is for 50-50, but the resolution conditions here might require a binary answer. Wait, the resolution_conditions have p2 as Yes, p1 as No, p3 as 0.5. But the market is supposed to resolve to Yes or No. However, the article mentions the sound is disputed. Since the market requires it to be \"clearly captured\" as a fart, and there's no official acknowledgment, it's not definitive. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 if the evidence is clear, but since it's disputed, maybe p3. But according to the user's resolution_conditions, p3 is 0.5, which might not be applicable here. Wait, the user's resolution_conditions have p1:0 (No), p2:1 (Yes), p3:0.5. But the market is supposed to resolve to Yes or No. The presence of p3 suggests a split, but the query's description says it resolves to Yes or No. However, the ancillary data might allow for p3 if uncertain. But according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The sources indicate the sound is debated, so without clear evidence, it's uncertain. But the market's terms require it to be \"clearly captured.\" Since the sound is present but not confirmed as a fart, it's not clearly captured, so should resolve to No. Wait, but the article says Polymarket will resolve based on the livestream. If the sound is there but not confirmed, does that count as Yes or No? The market's description says \"clearly captured on event livestreams or official recordings.\" If the sound is present but its nature is unclear, then it's not \"clearly\" a fart. Therefore, the resolution should be No (p1). But the article states that some bettors are convinced it's a fart, while others think it's something else. The resolution source is the official recordings. Unless the event organizers confirmed it, which they didn't, the answer should be No. However, the user's personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome here is that it's a chair noise, not a fart, given the context of the panelists moving on leather chairs. Therefore, the resolution should be No (p1). But the article mentions that the market is still active, so maybe it's unresolved. Wait, the current date is March 25, 2025, and the event was on March 20. The article from March 20 says the market is ongoing. But the user is asking now, after the event. The resolution should be based on whether the fart was confirmed. Since there's no official confirmation, and the sound is ambiguous, the answer is No. Hence, recommendation: p1.\n</think>\n\nThe market resolves based on whether an audible fart was clearly captured on official recordings or livestreams during the main stage of the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. According to the available evidence, a disputed sound occurred at timestamp 2:38:10 of the livestream immediately following former President Trump\u2019s pre-recorded speech[5][9][10]. While some participants claimed it was a fart, others suggested it could have been caused by movement on leather chairs or other environmental factors[5]. The event organizers did not confirm the nature of the sound, and no official sources explicitly verified it as a fart[5][11].  \n\nGiven the resolution criteria requiring clear evidence from official sources, and the absence of definitive confirmation, the market should resolve to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether anyone audibly farted during the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, is largely accurate and adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response correctly identifies that the event has already occurred and focuses on analyzing the available evidence from the specified sources, which are the official livestreams and recordings.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is thorough and well-structured. The AI carefully considers the evidence presented in the sources, noting the ambiguity of the sound heard during the livestream and the lack of official confirmation on its nature. This careful analysis leads to the conclusion that the sound was not \"clearly captured\" as a fart, aligning with the resolution criteria that require clear evidence from official sources for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe AI's recommendation of p1 (No) is based on the absence of definitive confirmation from the event organizers and the disputed nature of the sound, which is consistent with the user prompt's requirement for clear evidence. This decision is supported by the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain/50-50. Given that the evidence does not clearly support a \"Yes\" and the nature of the sound remains uncertain without official confirmation, the recommendation of \"No\" is appropriate.\n\nHowever, the response could improve in clarity and conciseness. The internal thought process of the AI is somewhat repetitive and could be streamlined to enhance readability and efficiency. Additionally, while the response does a good job of sticking to the facts and the specified sources, it could further emphasize the lack of official confirmation as a key reason for the \"No\" recommendation.\n\nOverall, the response is satisfactory as it stands, but minor improvements in clarity could enhance its quality. The decision to proceed with the recommendation of p1 (No) is justified based on the analysis provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzes the available evidence and adheres to the resolution criteria specified in the user prompt.

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932381 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:53:01 UTC"
