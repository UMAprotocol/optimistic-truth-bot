        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Calgary Flames vs. New York Rangers game scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Flames win, it's p2 (\"Flames\"), if the Rangers win, p1 (\"Rangers\"), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past relative to the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 18, so it's already happened. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [6] is a game recap from CBS Sports dated March 18, 2025. It states that the Flames beat the Rangers 2-1. Nazem Kadri and Matt Coronato scored for Calgary, and Dan Vladar made 12 saves. The Rangers' Artemi Panarin scored their only goal. This confirms the Flames won the game. \n\nOther sources like [1] and [4] are previews before the game, so they don't have the result. Source [6] is the most relevant as it's a post-game recap. The Wikipedia entry [3] and ESPN schedule [7] also list the Flames' record post-game, showing a win. \n\nSince the event occurred and the Flames won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirm the Flames' victory, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Calgary Flames defeated the New York Rangers 2-1 in their NHL game on March 18, 2025[6]. Nazem Kadri and Matt Coronato scored first-period goals for Calgary, while Artemi Panarin netted the lone goal for New York[6]. This result ended the Flames' three-game losing streak and improved their record to 32-25-11[3][6], while the Rangers fell to 33-30-6[8]. \n\nKey details:\n- **Game outcome**: Flames victory (2-1 final score)\n- **Winning goaltender**: Dan Vladar (33 saves)\n- **Key scorers**: \n  - Nazem Kadri (1 goal, 1 assist)\n  - Matt Coronato (powerplay goal)\n- **Standings impact**: \n  - Flames remained in Western Conference wild card contention[6]\n  - Rangers dropped out of Eastern Conference playoff position[6]\n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **\"Flames\"** as Calgary won the game outright. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation in any sources[6][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate and complete in its analysis and recommendation based on the user prompt and the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event date and verifies that it is in the past relative to the current timestamp. It uses a reliable source (CBS Sports recap) to confirm the outcome of the game, which is that the Calgary Flames won against the New York Rangers. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Flames win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds from verifying the date of the event to confirming its outcome through a credible source. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and finds none, which correctly leads to the exclusion of p3 (50-50 resolution) as an option. The response also cross-references other sources to reinforce the outcome, adding robustness to the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome accurately. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (\"Flames\") is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on verified facts and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified facts and the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using reliable sources and aligns the resolution recommendation correctly with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event outcome and logically excludes irrelevant resolution options based on the absence of postponement or cancellation indications.\"\n}\n```",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932528 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:55:28 UTC"
