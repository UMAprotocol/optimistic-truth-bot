        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Arkansas vs. Ole Miss college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Arkansas wins, the market resolves to \"Arkansas\" (p2), if Ole Miss wins, it's \"Ole Miss\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event should have taken place. Now, looking at the search results, several sources ([1], [4], [6], [7], [9], [10], [11], [16], [17]) report the game result. \n\nFrom source [1], the score is listed as Ole Miss 83, Arkansas 80. Source [4] confirms this with a detailed recap, mentioning Sean Pedulla's game-winning 3-pointer. Similarly, sources [7], [9], and [10] all describe the final moments where Pedulla's shot secured the victory for Ole Miss. The ESPN recap [10] and CBS Sports [9] both state the final score as 83-80 in favor of Ole Miss. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. In fact, sources like [3] discuss a canceled baseball game, but that's unrelated. All basketball-related results indicate the game was played on March 13. \n\nSince the game was played and Ole Miss won 83-80, the market should resolve to p1 (Ole Miss). There's no conflicting information in the sources, and multiple credible outlets confirm the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Arkansas vs. Ole Miss men's basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET was played as planned. Multiple sources confirm **Ole Miss defeated Arkansas 83-80** in a closely contested SEC Tournament second-round matchup[1][4][7][9][10][16][17]. The game featured a dramatic conclusion, with Ole Miss guard Sean Pedulla hitting a game-winning 3-pointer with 1.3 seconds remaining[7][9][10][11]. \n\nKey details:\n- **Final score**: Ole Miss 83, Arkansas 80[1][16]\n- **Game status**: Completed as scheduled (no postponement or cancellation)[1][4][7]\n- **Decisive play**: Pedulla's 3-pointer after Arkansas missed two critical free throws in the final seconds[7][9][10]\n\nThe outcome meets the resolution condition for **p1 (Ole Miss)** as defined in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925273 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:54:33 UTC"
