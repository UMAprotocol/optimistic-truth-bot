The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Dartmouth vs. Cornell men's basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 2:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Cornell wins, it's p1; Dartmouth, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the specified date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 15, so the game should have already happened. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game. \n\nSearch result [1] from Dartmouth's athletics site reports that on March 15, 2025, Dartmouth lost to Cornell in the Ivy Madness semifinal with a score of 87-71. Similarly, [6] from Cornell's site also discusses the semifinal game on March 15, where Cornell won against Dartmouth. Another source, [11] from The Score, confirms the final score as Cornell 87, Dartmouth 71. Additionally, [9] from Cornell's site details their victory over Dartmouth, advancing them to the championship game. \n\nAll these sources consistently report Cornell's win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The NCAA cancellation in [4] is from 2020, irrelevant here. The other results about previous games or other sports (like hockey) don't affect this basketball game's outcome. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and Cornell won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Dartmouth vs. Cornell men's basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 2:00 PM ET was played as planned. According to multiple verified sources, **Cornell defeated Dartmouth 87-71** in the Ivy Madness semifinal[1][6][9][11]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was decisively in Cornell's favor. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Dartmouth vs. Cornell basketball game occurred on March 15, 2025, and that Cornell won the game with a score of 87-71. This outcome is verified through multiple sources, as mentioned in the response. The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event occurred, checking multiple sources for verification, and aligning the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It correctly ignores irrelevant information (such as the NCAA cancellation from 2020) and focuses solely on the event in question. The reasoning is thorough and leads to a clear, well-supported conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple credible sources, ensuring the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Cornell win) aligns perfectly with the ancillary data definitions provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event specified in the user prompt and uses verified sources to confirm the outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
