        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Rodrigo Duterte was released from custody by March 14, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he was released, even if under house arrest or bond. If he's just moved to another custody location, it's still \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events from the search results. Duterte was arrested on March 11, 2025, at Manila airport (sources 6, 7, 14). He was then transferred to ICC custody in The Hague. His initial court appearance was on March 14 via video (sources 1, 2, 4). \n\nLooking at the key dates: the resolution deadline is March 14. On that day, Duterte appeared before the ICC judges but remained in custody. The hearing was about verifying his identity and informing him of charges, not about release. Source 1 mentions he's in ICC custody as of March 14. Source 4 also states he was in a detention center during the hearing. \n\nThere's no mention in any of the search results of him being released by March 14. Later sources (like 8, 9, 10, 15) discuss requests for interim release after March 14, but those are all post-deadline. The resolution date is March 14, so any events after that don't count. \n\nThe conditions for release (house arrest or bond) weren't met by the deadline. All sources up to March 14 indicate he remained in custody. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\", which corresponds to p1 in the resolution conditions.\n</think>\n\nRodrigo Duterte was **not released from custody by March 14, 2025, 11:59 PM ET**. The ICC\u2019s Pre-Trial Chamber I conducted his initial appearance hearing on March 14, 2025, during which he remained in detention at the ICC facility in The Hague. The hearing focused on procedural matters, including verifying his identity, informing him of the charges (murder as a crime against humanity), and confirming his understanding of the proceedings[1][2][4]. No interim release, house arrest, or bond was granted by the resolution deadline. Subsequent discussions about potential interim release occurred after March 14[8][9][10][15], which fall outside the market\u2019s resolution timeframe.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively analyzes the event in question\u2014whether Rodrigo Duterte was released from custody by March 14, 2025\u2014and provides a clear resolution based on the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the key date and conditions for resolution. It uses multiple sources to confirm that Duterte remained in custody as of the resolution date, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts. The response does not predict future outcomes but focuses on verifying what has definitively happened up to the specified date.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the sources, noting the arrest, transfer, and the nature of the court appearance. It correctly concludes that since Duterte was not released by the deadline, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The reasoning is thorough, considering all stipulated conditions such as release on bond or house arrest, and confirms none were met.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its context accurately, adhering strictly to the user prompt's conditions. The recommendation to resolve as p1 is well-supported by the facts presented and directly corresponds to the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI has used the sources effectively to gather relevant information and has not included unnecessary or unrelated details.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the query. There is no need for a rerun or further refinement of the response.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the query based on verified facts and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's details and context, providing a well-supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
