        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Natural Gas\" during his event with the Louisiana Governor on March 24, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any transcripts or mentions of that specific event. Looking through the provided sources, there are several mentions of Trump's speeches and events related to LNG (liquefied natural gas) in Louisiana. \n\nSearch result [11] is a transcript from Trump's remarks with Governor Landry on March 24. Let me scan through that. In the transcript, Trump talks about LNG plants in Louisiana, mentioning how he expedited permits for them. He uses the term \"LNG\" multiple times, which stands for liquefied natural gas. However, the exact phrase \"natural gas\" needs to be checked. \n\nIn the transcript, Trump says, \"they tried to get permits and these were 12 billion and I think 15 billion dollar plants... they were working on them for 14 years... I was able to get them in less than a week.\" He refers to LNG plants, but does he say \"natural gas\"? Let me check again. The term \"natural gas\" isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts from [11]. He uses \"LNG\" which is an abbreviation, but the resolution conditions state that the exact term \"Natural Gas\" must be spoken. \n\nLooking at other sources, [10] mentions Trump's focus on LNG exports and energy dominance, but again uses \"LNG\" rather than the full term. [17] also discusses LNG exports but not the exact phrase. \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that pluralization or possessive forms count, but abbreviations like LNG don't unless they're part of a compound word. Since \"LNG\" is an abbreviation and not a compound of \"natural gas,\" it wouldn't count. \n\nTherefore, based on the available transcripts and sources, Trump did not say the exact term \"natural gas\" during the event. The market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nThe scheduled event on March 24, 2025, featured President Donald Trump and Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry discussing energy infrastructure and economic investments. While Trump emphasized liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and energy dominance during the remarks, **the exact term \"natural gas\" was not used** in the available transcripts of the event[11][14]. \n\nTrump referenced \"LNG plants\" and \"liquid gold\" when discussing energy infrastructure[11][14], but these terms do not meet the resolution criteria requiring the explicit phrase \"natural gas.\" The market's conditions specify that abbreviations like \"LNG\" or compound terms (e.g., \"liquefied natural gas\") do not qualify unless the exact term \"natural gas\" is spoken. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that abbreviations like \"LNG\" do not meet the resolution criteria unless the exact term is spoken, which aligns with the user prompt's conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the transcripts for the exact usage of the term \"Natural Gas\" and correctly concludes that the term was not used, based on the evidence provided in the transcripts. The AI's reasoning process is clear, methodical, and well-aligned with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms that the event took place as scheduled and examines the correct transcripts from the event. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) is based on the verified absence of the term \"Natural Gas\" in the speech, which is in full alignment with the facts and the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI has focused solely on the required term and its usage during the event, without deviating into irrelevant details or assumptions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and strictly adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the conditions set forth in the user prompt and is supported by the factual content of the event's transcripts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, logically analyzes the transcripts, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to verify the non-usage of the term 'Natural Gas' and makes a well-supported recommendation based on the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924958 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:49:18 UTC",
