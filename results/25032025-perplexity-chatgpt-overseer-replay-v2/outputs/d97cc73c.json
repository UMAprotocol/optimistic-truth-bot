That's a primary source, so reliable. \n\n[2] ESPN's recap also states Arizona won 86-80. \n\n[3] AllSportsTucson confirms Arizona's victory, 86-80, and mentions they advanced to play Houston. \n\n[4] CBS Sports and [5] YouTube both report the same score, Arizona winning. \n\n[7] TheScore.com's stats show Arizona 86, Texas Tech 80. \n\nAll sources consistently report Arizona as the winner. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so no need for p3. Since Arizona won, the resolution should be p2. No conflicting info found.

The Wildcats advanced to face Houston in the championship game after overcoming a short-handed Texas Tech team missing key players due to injuries[2][3].

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of event, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Arizona vs. Texas Tech game occurred on March 14, 2025, and that Arizona won with a score of 86-80. This outcome aligns perfectly with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"Arizona\" (p2). The response uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the game's outcome, including Texas Tech's official site, ESPN, CBS Sports, and others, which satisfies the requirement for verification through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources to conclude that Arizona won the game. It correctly dismisses the possibilities of postponement or cancellation as there were no indications of such events. The reasoning is straightforward and follows the logical steps required by the system prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Arizona win) is directly aligned with the verified facts and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the user prompt and system instructions without adding unnecessary details or assumptions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Arizona vs. Texas Tech game using multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the game's outcome and logically concludes the market resolution based on the user prompt's conditions.

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923797 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:29:57 UTC",
