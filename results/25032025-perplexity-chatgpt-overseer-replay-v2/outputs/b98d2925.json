The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the North Carolina vs. Duke game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Duke wins, it's p1; if North Carolina wins, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning the game on March 14, 2025. Source [1] from goheels.com details the ACC Tournament semifinal where Duke beat North Carolina 74-71. Source [6] from ESPN also confirms this result, noting Duke's victory despite a strong comeback by UNC. Additionally, source [4] from goduke.com discusses Duke's regular-season win over UNC on March 8, 2025, which is a different game. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no confusion between the regular-season game and the ACC Tournament semifinal. The query specifically refers to the March 14 game, which the sources [1], [4], and [6] all reference as the ACC semifinal. The result there is a Duke win. \n\nI should also check for any postponements or cancellations. Sources [2] and [7] discuss a postponed game from 2014 and 2018, which are irrelevant here. The March 14, 2025 game wasn't postponed or canceled, as per the detailed recaps. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and Duke won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed in the relevant search results. All evidence points to the game being completed with Duke as the victor.\n</think>\n\nDuke defeated North Carolina, 74-71, in the ACC Tournament semifinals on March 14, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][6]. The game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation mentioned in the relevant 2025 game reports[1][4][6]. Historical postponements from 2014 and 2018[2][7] don't apply to this event.  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **p1** (Duke win).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
