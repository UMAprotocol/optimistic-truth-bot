        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Cal Poly vs. UC Riverside basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Cal Poly wins, the market resolves to \"Cal Poly\" (p2), and if UC Riverside wins, it resolves to \"UC Riverside\" (p1). If the game is postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the event should have already taken place. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game happened. For example, source [1] mentions the Mustangs (Cal Poly) won 96-83 against UC Riverside in the Big West Championship quarterfinals on March 13. Similarly, sources [2], [4], [5], [6], [10], and [11] all report the same score with Cal Poly as the winner. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game taking place as scheduled, with detailed stats and player performances. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation. \n\nNext, confirming the result: Cal Poly won 96-83. The resolution conditions state a Cal Poly win corresponds to p2. Since the game was completed and the result is clear, the market should resolve to p2. No conflicting information in the sources; all agree on the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nCal Poly defeated UC Riverside 96-83 in the Big West Conference Tournament quarterfinals on March 13, 2025. The game proceeded as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the search results. Cal Poly led wire-to-wire, shooting 51.4% from three-point range and securing their first semifinal appearance since 2014[1][2][4][10]. Key performances included Owen Koonce's 20 points and Jarred Hyder's record-breaking three-pointer[1][6]. UC Riverside's Isaiah Moses scored a game-high 30 points but couldn't overcome Cal Poly's perimeter shooting[2][4][5].\n\n**Resolution Analysis**  \nThe ancillary data specifies:  \n- **p1**: UC Riverside win  \n- **p2**: Cal Poly win  \n- **p3**: Canceled game (50-50 split)  \n\nSince the game occurred as scheduled and Cal Poly won decisively, the market resolves to **p2**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930389 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:19:49 UTC"
