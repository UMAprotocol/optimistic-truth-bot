        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Gay\" during his Kennedy Center board meeting on March 17, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump's statements during that event. The search results provided cover various events at the Kennedy Center, including cancellations of LGBTQ+ performances and Trump's leadership changes. \n\nLooking at the sources, especially the ones related to the March 17 event. Source [2] mentions Trump's tour and board meeting, where he criticized the center's state and discussed changes, but there's no mention of him using the word \"Gay\". Source [9] and [12] also discuss the board meeting but don't note any specific use of the term. \n\nSource [3] is a YouTube video transcript where Harvey Fierstein's ban is discussed, but Trump's speech isn't detailed. Source [10] talks about Grenell's response to booing but again, no mention of Trump saying \"Gay\". \n\nThe key here is that none of the search results explicitly state that Trump used the word \"Gay\" during the March 17 event. The ancillary data specifies that any usage, regardless of context, counts, but pluralization or possessive forms are included. However, without any evidence from the sources that he did say it, the resolution should default to \"No\". \n\nAdditionally, the updates clarify that Q&A sessions count, but there's no indication in the sources that such sessions occurred or that Trump used the term. Since the event wasn't canceled and occurred as scheduled, and no sources report the word being used, the answer should be p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided search results and analysis of Donald Trump's March 17, 2025 Kennedy Center board meeting appearance, there is no evidence that Trump uttered the word \"Gay\" during the event. Multiple sources detail Trump's criticisms of the Kennedy Center's physical condition and programming[2][9][12], his plans to reshape the Honors selection process[2][9], and audience reactions to Vice President Vance[9][10], but none mention any usage of the specific term \"Gay\" in any context.\n\nKey details from the coverage:\n- Trump focused on criticizing the Center's \"tremendous disrepair\" and \"woke\" programming during his remarks[2][9]\n- Discussed infrastructure improvements and potential show cancellations[12]\n- Addressed plans to influence Kennedy Center Honors selections[2][9]\n- No transcripts or reports indicate he used \"Gay\" in speeches, Q&A, or other interactions[2][9][12]\n\nWhile the meeting occurred amidst controversy over canceled LGBTQ+ performances[1][4][6-8][15], the search results contain no documentation of Trump using the specific contractual term during this appearance. The resolution conditions require direct evidence of the word being spoken, which isn't present in any available sources.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment with the facts of the event. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on the specific event mentioned in the user prompt, which is Donald Trump's appearance at the Kennedy Center on March 17, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on whether Trump said the word \"Gay\" during this event. The response also correctly notes that any form of the word, including pluralization and possessive forms, would count towards the resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking multiple sources for any mention of Trump using the word \"Gay\" during the event. It concludes that since none of the sources explicitly state that Trump used the word, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). This reasoning is sound given the evidence provided and the specific requirements of the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was not canceled. It also aligns the recommendation with the facts by providing a detailed analysis of the sources that discuss the event but do not mention Trump using the specified term. The recommendation of p1 (No) is based on the absence of evidence indicating that Trump said \"Gay\" during the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The response does not include irrelevant information and stays focused on the event in question. It uses the sources effectively to come to a conclusion based on the absence of evidence of the word being used.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, adheres to the instructions, and provides a logical and well-supported recommendation.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907391 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:56:31 UTC",
