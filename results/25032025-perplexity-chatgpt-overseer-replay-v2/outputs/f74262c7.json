The ancillary data specifies that if the Magic win, it's p2; Pelicans win, p1; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 13, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual result of that game. \n\nLooking at the search results, all sources [1][2][3][4][5][6] confirm that the Magic won the game 113-93. For example, source [1] states the Magic had a 30-point halftime lead and won by 20 points. Source [2] mentions the Magic's dominant victory and their seventh straight win against the Pelicans. The box score in [5] clearly shows the Magic's final score as 113 and the Pelicans as 93. \n\nAdditionally, there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed stats and post-game reactions. Coach Willie Green's comments in [6] about the Pelicans' performance further confirm the game occurred. \n\nSince the Magic won decisively, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Magic\"). There's no ambiguity here\u2014all evidence points to a Magic victory without any issues affecting the game's completion.\n</think>\n\nThe Orlando Magic defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 113-93 in their March 13, 2025 matchup, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][3][4][5]. Key details from the game:\n\n**Game Outcome**\n- Final score: Magic 113, Pelicans 93[1][3][5]\n- Orlando never trailed after taking the lead at 9:24 in the first quarter[2][4]\n- Magic built a 30-point halftime lead (68-38)[1][3], the largest halftime advantage in franchise history[4]\n\n**Key Performances**\n- Paolo Banchero: 34 points, 11 rebounds, 4 steals[1][3][4]\n- Franz Wagner: 27 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists[1][3]\n- Combined 61 points from Orlando's starting forwards[2][4]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations mentioned in any reports[1][2][3][4][5][6]. This result mathematically eliminated New Orleans from playoff contention[2][6] while keeping Orlando in the Eastern Conference play-in tournament race[2][4].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The details provided about the game, such as the score, key performances, and the lack of postponements or cancellations, align with the user prompt's resolution conditions. The response logically concludes that the market should resolve to p2 (\"Magic\"), which matches the ancillary data provided in the user prompt where p2 corresponds to a Magic win.\n\nThe response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the market based on the conditions specified: it confirms the game occurred, was not postponed or canceled, and that the Magic won. There is no missing information, bias, or errors detected in the response. The response strictly adheres to the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts, and it correctly ignores any potential for predicting outcomes or considering hypothetical scenarios.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event, adheres to the resolution conditions, and provides a well-supported recommendation based on established facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and aligns perfectly with the ancillary data and system prompt requirements.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905327 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:22:07 UTC"
