        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the price of eggs increased from January to February 2025. The ancillary data specifies that \"Yes\" (p2) is the outcome if February's price is higher than January's. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The CPI report for February 2025 was released on March 12, 2025, which is before the current date of March 25, 2025. So the event has already occurred, and the data is available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the February 2025 egg price. Source [3] states the average price in February was $5.90 per dozen, up from $4.95 in January. Source [4] confirms this with BLS data showing a 12.5% month-over-month increase. Source [9] also notes the USDA report indicating a rise from January to February. \n\nThe key point is comparing January and February prices. January's price was $4.95 (sources [4], [9], [10]), and February's was $5.90 (sources [3], [4], [9]). This is a clear increase, so the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). All the relevant data points confirm the upward trend, and there's no conflicting information about the February price being lower. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether the price of eggs (Grade A, Large, Cost per Dozen) was higher in February 2025 than January 2025, using BLS CPI data as the resolution source. According to the BLS data cited across multiple sources, **the average price rose from $4.95 per dozen in January 2025 to $5.90 per dozen in February 2025**, representing a **12.5% month-over-month increase**[3][4][9]. This upward trend is corroborated by USDA reports[9] and market analyses[4][11], which attribute the price surge to ongoing bird flu impacts and seasonal demand pressures.\n\nSince the February 2025 price ($5.90) definitively exceeded the January 2025 price ($4.95), this market resolves to **\"Yes\"** under the stated conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927995 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:39:55 UTC"
