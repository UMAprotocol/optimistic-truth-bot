The ancillary data specifies that if the Pistons win, it's p2; if the Heat win, p1; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game on March 19, 2025. Sources [1], [2], [5], [6], and [7] all confirm the game took place. The box score in [2] and [7] shows the Pistons won 116-113. Specifically, [2] states \"Cunningham banks in a 3 for the win and Pistons send Heat to their 9th straight loss, 116-113.\" That's a clear indication of the Pistons' victory. \n\nLooking at the video highlights in [1] and [5], Cade Cunningham hit a game-winning three-pointer with 0.6 seconds left, securing the win. The YouTube transcripts describe the Pistons' celebration and the final score. Also, [6] discusses Cunningham's clutch performance and the impact of the win on their season. \n\nI should check for any postponement or cancellation mentions. Source [4] talks about a Mavericks-Pistons game postponed, but that's a different date (March 19 is the Heat game). The user's query is about the March 19 game, which wasn't postponed. The game proceeded, so no need for p3. \n\nAll evidence points to the Pistons winning. The resolution conditions say Pistons win is p2. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Pistons defeated the Miami Heat 116-113 on March 19, 2025, with Cade Cunningham hitting a game-winning three-pointer over Bam Adebayo with 0.6 seconds remaining[1][2][5][6]. The box score confirms Detroit's victory, showing they outscored Miami in three quarters (22-32, 36-28, 30-33, 28-20) despite Miami's late rally[2][7]. \n\nKey factors included:\n- **Cunningham's triple-double**: 25 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists[6]\n- **Clutch defense**: Ausar Thompson's critical block and steal in the final minutes[1]\n- **Rebounding advantage**: Pistons secured 47 total rebounds (13 offensive) vs Miami's 37[7]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[2][7], and multiple verified sources confirm the Pistons' victory[1][5][6]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
