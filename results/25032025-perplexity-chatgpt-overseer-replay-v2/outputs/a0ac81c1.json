The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Troy vs. Kentucky NCAA Tournament game scheduled for March 21, 2025, at 7:10 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Kentucky wins, it resolves to p1 (Kentucky), if Troy wins, p2 (Troy), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Next, check the search results to determine the outcome. \n\nLooking at the sources, all mention the game result. Source [1] states Kentucky won 76-57. Source [2] confirms the same score and that Kentucky advanced. Other sources like [4], [6], and [8] also report Kentucky's victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the game occurred as scheduled and Kentucky won decisively, the resolution should be p1. All sources align, so no contradictions. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament game between Kentucky and Troy took place as scheduled on March 21, 2025, at 7:10 PM ET. Third-seeded Kentucky defeated 14th-seeded Troy 76-57[1][2][4][6][8]. Key factors included:\n\n- **Kentucky's defensive dominance**: Held Troy to 34.9% shooting overall and 25% from three-point range[5][8], with Amari Williams' interior presence disrupting Troy's offense[8].\n- **Otega Oweh's standout performance**: Led all scorers with 20 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists[1][2][6].\n- **Decisive second-half run**: A 16-0 Kentucky surge extended the lead to 61-39 midway through the second half, effectively sealing the outcome[6][7].\n\nThe game was completed without postponement or cancellation[1][4][8]. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market resolves to Kentucky's victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
