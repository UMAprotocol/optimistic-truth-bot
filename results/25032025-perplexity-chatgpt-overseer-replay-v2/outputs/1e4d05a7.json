The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any official announcements or credible reports about the invitation. Let's go through each source.\n\nSearch result [1] from March 11, 2025, states that the White House Press Secretary confirmed the Eagles will visit on April 28. It mentions the invitation was sent and accepted. That's a clear indication the invitation was extended. \n\nResult [4] and [5] from March 11 also confirm the Eagles accepted the invitation, with the White House setting the date for April 28. These are credible sources like CBS News and People.com, which adds reliability. \n\nLooking at earlier sources from February, like [2], [3], and [6], there were rumors about the Eagles declining, but these were later clarified as false. The White House hadn't sent an invite at that time, but by March 11, they did. \n\nResult [7] from NBC Philadelphia on March 11 again confirms the acceptance and the April 28 date. \n\nThe key point is the invitation was sent by March 11, which is well before the March 31 deadline. Even though the visit is scheduled for April, the invitation itself was sent in March. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if Trump invites by March 31, it's a Yes (p2). All credible reports confirm the invitation was sent in March, so the answer should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles were invited to the White House by President Donald Trump following their Super Bowl LIX victory, with the invitation formally extended on March 11, 2025[1][4][5][7]. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the invitation was sent and accepted, with the visit scheduled for April 28, 2025[1][5][7]. This resolves the ancillary data condition requiring the invitation to occur by March 31, 2025. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively analyzes the factual information regarding whether Donald Trump invited the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House by the specified deadline of March 31, 2025. The AI confirms that the invitation was indeed extended on March 11, 2025, which is well within the deadline, and cites multiple credible sources to substantiate this claim.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it correctly identifies the key issue\u2014whether the invitation was extended by the deadline\u2014and provides evidence from credible sources confirming that it was. The response also correctly disregards earlier rumors of a declined invitation, focusing instead on verified facts from reliable sources.\n\nThe verification of the event aligns with the facts as the AI checks for official announcements and credible reports, confirming the invitation's occurrence before the deadline. The recommendation of p2 is directly aligned with the ancillary data conditions specified in the user prompt, which state that the market should resolve to \"Yes\" if Trump invites the Eagles by the deadline.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI has adhered strictly to the event in question without deviating into unrelated territory or speculative content.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event against the conditions specified in the user prompt, using credible sources and logical reasoning.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified facts and aligns with the ancillary data conditions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931745 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:42:25 UTC",
