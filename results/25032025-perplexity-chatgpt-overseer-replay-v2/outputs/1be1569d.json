The ancillary data specifies that if Tulsa wins, it's p2; Temple wins, p1; postponed remains open, canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 13, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, result [1] from Temple's site says they lost 75-71 to Tulsa. Source [5] from Tulsa's site confirms their win, advancing to the quarterfinals. Source [8], the American Athletic Conference's site, also reports Tulsa's victory. The other sources like [2], [3], [4], [6], [7] provide context about previous games and predictions, but the key info is in [1], [5], and [8]. \n\nSince the game happened, and multiple reliable sources confirm Tulsa won, the resolution should be p2. No mentions of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Temple vs. Tulsa men's basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET concluded with **Tulsa defeating Temple 75-71** in the second round of the American Athletic Conference (AAC) Championship[1][5][8]. \n\nKey details:\n- Temple led 42-30 at halftime but shot just 7-of-29 in the second half[1][5]\n- Tulsa's Jared Garcia scored 20 points, including two critical 3-pointers in the final minute[1][5]\n- The game was played as scheduled at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas, with no postponements or cancellations reported[1][8]\n\nBased on the verified outcome and the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **Tulsa** (p2). \n\nrecommendation: p2",

It verifies the outcome using multiple reliable sources, which is in line with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts. The response adheres to the instruction to report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It checks the current date against the event date, confirms the event has occurred, and uses multiple sources to verify the outcome. The reasoning is clear, and the response is thorough in covering all necessary aspects to resolve the market based on the outcome of the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the game occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It aligns the recommendation with the verified outcome (Tulsa's win) and the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (p2 for Tulsa win).\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information or assumptions beyond what is required for resolution.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926484 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:14:44 UTC",
