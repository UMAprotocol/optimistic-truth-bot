The event date is March 15, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 25, 2025. So first, I need to check if the game happened and who won.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Source [1] states Alabama State won 60-56. Source [2] and [3] also confirm Alabama State's victory. The championship title is mentioned in [1], [2], and [4], with specific details about the final score and key players. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Alabama State wins, the market resolves to \"Alabama State\" (p2). Since all credible sources report Alabama State as the winner, the correct resolution should be p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Alabama State Hornets defeated the Jackson State Tigers 60-56 in the SWAC Tournament Championship on March 15, 2025, securing their first NCAA Tournament berth since 2011[1][2][3]. The game featured a late surge by Alabama State, with CJ Hines leading the team with 20 points, including four three-pointers[1][3]. Jackson State briefly held a nine-point second-half lead, but Alabama State closed the game on a 9-3 run in the final two minutes to clinch the title[1][4].\n\n**Key details**:\n- Final score: Alabama State 60, Jackson State 56[1][2]\n- Alabama State's defense held Jackson State to 37% field goal shooting[3]\n- Jackson State's Shannon Grant Jr. tied for a game-high 20 points but committed six turnovers[4]\n\nThe outcome meets the resolution condition specifying that an Alabama State victory resolves to \"Alabama State\" (p2). The game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][2][5]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which states that an Alabama State win should resolve the market to \"Alabama State\" (p2).\n\nThe response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, ensuring that the information is reliable and verifiable. It also correctly adheres to the system prompt instructions by not predicting future outcomes but rather reporting on an event that has already occurred. The response does not mention any postponement or cancellation, which matches the information provided, and thus, it does not consider resolution p3 (50-50) as applicable.\n\nFurthermore, the response is logically sound and complete, providing specific details about the game's score, key players, and significant moments, which supports the credibility of the information and the final recommendation.\n\nThere are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt and aligns the recommendation directly with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
