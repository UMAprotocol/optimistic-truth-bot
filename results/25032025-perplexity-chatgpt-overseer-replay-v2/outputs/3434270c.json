The ancillary data specifies that if Auburn wins, it's p1; Creighton, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 22 has already occurred. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [6], [9], [14]) confirm that Auburn defeated Creighton with a final score of 82-70. For example, source [1] states, \"No. 1 Auburn takes down Creighton in round of 32\" and source [2] mentions \"Auburn coach Bruce Pearl... closed out the ninth-seeded Bluejays 82-70.\" These consistent reports across different sources confirm the result. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed stats and post-game analyses. Therefore, the conditions for p1 (Auburn win) are met. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all sources align. The resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nAuburn defeated Creighton 82-70 in their March 22, 2025 NCAA Tournament second-round game, as confirmed by multiple sources detailing the Tigers' second-half surge and key performances from Tahaad Pettiford (23 points) and Chad Baker-Mazara (17 points)[1][2][6][9][14].

        "response": "The evaluation of the Perplexity AI oracle response reveals that it has adhered well to the instructions provided in the system prompt and has accurately resolved the query based on the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Creighton vs. Auburn game) occurred on March 22, 2025, and the current date is March 25, 2025, which places the event in the past relative to the current timestamp. The response then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event using multiple sources, which consistently report that Auburn won the game. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for the occurrence of the event, confirms it was not postponed or canceled, and verifies the outcome (Auburn's win) through multiple reliable sources. It then aligns this outcome with the ancillary data provided (p1 corresponds to an Auburn win), leading to a recommendation of p1. The reasoning is thorough and follows a clear, logical progression.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using credible sources. It ensures that the recommendation (p1 for an Auburn win) directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and aligns with the user prompt's conditions without introducing any irrelevant information or subjective interpretation.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is both accurate and reliable, adhering strictly to the instructions and factual verification required by the system prompt. There is no need for a rerun or default to p4, as the response satisfactorily resolves the query based on the established facts and conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources, aligns perfectly with the ancillary data, and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough, logically structured, and factually accurate, with no apparent errors or biases.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
