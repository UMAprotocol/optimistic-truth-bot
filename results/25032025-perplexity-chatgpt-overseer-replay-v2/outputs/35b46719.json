        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Million\" or \"Billion\" 10 or more times during his Kennedy Center event on March 17, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The main sources are transcripts and articles from the event. Let's look through each relevant source for mentions of \"million\" or \"billion.\"\n\nLooking at source [1], Trump mentions \"$250 million\" once. Source [2] has a transcript where he says \"$250 million\" again and \"$30,000\" but that's not million or billion. Source [4] includes a transcript where he talks about \"80,000 pages\" but no million/billion. Source [5] mentions \"$250 million\" and \"$30,000\". Source [8] has a transcript where he says \"$250 million\" again. Source [16] also mentions \"$250 million\" and \"$30,000\". Source [17] repeats the same \"$250 million\" figure.\n\nFrom all these, the key term \"million\" is used multiple times, but I need to count each occurrence. In the transcripts, he refers to the $250 million cost multiple times. Let's check each instance:\n\n- In source [1], he says \"$250 million\" once.\n- Source [2] also mentions \"$250 million\" once.\n- Source [5] again \"$250 million\" once.\n- Source [8] same figure once.\n- Source [16] same figure once.\n- Source [17] same figure once.\n\nWait, but these might all be the same statement repeated across different sources. Since the event is the same, the mentions of \"$250 million\" are likely the same instance across different reports. So, he might have said it once during the event. However, in source [9], there's a mention of \"$250 million\" again, but again, it's the same event. \n\nAdditionally, in source [15], the article states that the Kennedy Center's operating budget includes about $45 million from Congress. But that's not Trump's statement during the event. \n\nLooking through all the transcripts, the only instances of \"million\" are the repeated \"$250 million\" reference. Even if he said it multiple times in the same speech, I need to verify if it's counted each time. For example, in the transcript from source [2], he says \"$250 million\" once. In source [16], the same quote is present. So, it's the same instance. \n\nTherefore, the count of \"million\" is once. There's no mention of \"billion\" in any of the provided sources related to this event. \n\nSince the required count is 10+ times, and he only said \"million\" once, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The ancillary data specifies that pluralization/possessive counts, but other forms don't. Here, \"million\" is used once, so it's below the threshold. \n\nAlso, checking if the event was canceled or not aired\u2014it wasn't, as multiple sources confirm his attendance. Therefore, the resolution is based on the actual statements made, which don't meet the 10+ threshold.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump's appearance at the Kennedy Center board meeting on March 17, 2025, included specific references to financial figures. During his remarks, he stated:\n\n- **\"They spent a fortune $250 million\"** while criticizing the center's underground facilities[1][2][5][8][16][17]. This represents **one instance** of using \"million\" in his comments.\n\nNo other uses of \"million\" or \"billion\" were documented in transcripts or reports from the event. The $45 million congressional allocation to the Kennedy Center\u2019s budget[15] was not mentioned by Trump during his appearance.\n\nThe resolution conditions require **10+ instances** of these terms. With only one verified occurrence, the threshold for \"Yes\" (p2) was not met. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event took place on March 17, 2025, and that Donald Trump mentioned the term \"million\" during his speech. The response correctly adheres to the user prompt's requirement to count each instance of \"million\" or \"billion\" mentioned during the event, regardless of context. The response also correctly identifies that the term \"billion\" was not used.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by analyzing multiple sources to confirm the number of times \"million\" was mentioned. It correctly identifies that the repeated mentions of \"$250 million\" across different sources likely refer to the same instance, thus counting it as one instance. This shows a good understanding of the prompt's requirement to count distinct mentions. The response also correctly concludes that the threshold of 10+ mentions was not met.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was not canceled. It aligns the recommendation with the facts gathered from the sources, concluding that the term \"million\" was mentioned fewer than 10 times. This aligns with the resolution condition p1 (\"No\").\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks multiple sources and carefully counts the mentions of the relevant terms as per the user prompt's instructions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, adheres to the instructions, and provides a well-reasoned recommendation based on verified facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately counts the mentions of 'million' and 'billion,' verifies the event occurrence, and aligns the recommendation with the facts and user prompt conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response demonstrates thorough source analysis and logical reasoning in counting term mentions and verifying event details. It adheres closely to the user prompt instructions and resolution conditions.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905067 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:17:47 UTC",
