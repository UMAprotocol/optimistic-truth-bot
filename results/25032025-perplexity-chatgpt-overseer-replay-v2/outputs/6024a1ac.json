The game in question was scheduled for March 22 at 2:00 PM ET. Since March 22 is three days before the current date, the event has already occurred. \n\nNext, I need to check the outcome of the game. The user provided ancillary data specifying that if Illinois State wins, the market resolves to \"Illinois State\" (p2), and if Presbyterian College wins, it resolves to \"Presbyterian College\" (p1). If postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it resolves 50-50 (p3). \n\nI should look for any sources that confirm the game's result. However, the search results provided are empty. Without any data on the game's outcome, I can't verify if it was played, postponed, or canceled. According to the instructions, if the event date is in the past and there's no verifiable information, I should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. But since there's no data at all, even for assumptions, the correct resolution here would be p4, indicating insufficient information to resolve the market.\n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions mention p3 for canceled games, but without any evidence of cancellation or postponement, p4 is the appropriate choice.

The ancillary data specifies that if Illinois State wins, it's p2; if Presbyterian wins, p1; postponed keeps it open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the game date. The query says March 22 at 2:00 PM ET, but the current date is March 25, 2025. So the game should have already happened. Let me look through the search results to confirm the outcome.\n\nLooking at the sources, multiple results mention the game. Source [1] from flohoops.com states Illinois State beat Presbyterian in the CBI first round on March 23, 2025. The final score was 78-70. Source [2] from bigsouthsports.com also confirms Presbyterian lost 78-70 to Illinois State on March 24, 2025. Source [3] (CBS Sports) and [4] (goredbirds.com) both report the same score, with Illinois State winning. Even the ESPN box score in [12] shows Illinois State 78-70.\n\nWait, the game was scheduled for March 22, but the actual game date in the sources is March 23. That might be a discrepancy. Let me check the details. Source [7] mentions the game was on March 23 at 6:30 pm EDT. Source [8] also lists the game date as March 23. So the game was played a day later than originally scheduled. However, the ancillary data says if postponed, the market remains open. But the game wasn't canceled; it was played on March 23. \n\nThe resolution conditions mention postponement leading to the market staying open, but since the game was played, even a day later, it's considered completed. Therefore, the outcome is valid. All sources confirm Illinois State won 78-70. Thus, the market should resolve to p2 (Illinois State). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources agree on the outcome. Even the YouTube video [6] and the Fox Sports box score [10] confirm the result. No sources suggest a cancellation or a different result. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between Illinois State and Presbyterian College was played on **March 23, 2025**, with Illinois State defeating Presbyterian by a score of **78-70**[1][2][3][4][8][12]. Multiple verified sources confirm the outcome, including official team reports[4], sports news outlets[1][3], and statistical databases[8][12]. \n\nKey details:\n- **Final score**: Illinois State 78, Presbyterian 70  \n- **Game context**: First round of the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) tournament  \n- **Statistical leaders**:  \n  - Illinois State's Chase Walker (20 points, 9 rebounds)[3][4]  \n  - Presbyterian's Kory Mincy (21 points)[2][8]  \n\nThe game occurred one day after its originally scheduled date of March 22[7][9], but was completed without cancellation. Per the resolution conditions, this qualifies as a completed game rather than a postponement requiring market extension.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The outcome of the game is consistently reported across multiple sources as a win for Illinois State with a score of 78-70. This information aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\n\n2. **Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through reliable sources. It correctly identifies that the game was not canceled but postponed by one day, and thus, according to the ancillary data provided, the market should resolve based on the game's outcome since it was completed.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources to conclude that Illinois State won. It considers the implications of the game's postponement and correctly concludes that the market should resolve to p2 (Illinois State win) as per the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is fully justified by the analysis of the game's outcome. The response ensures that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n5. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not omit any crucial information that would affect the resolution recommendation. It effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring a robust verification process.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the required standards of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935608 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:46:48 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease utilize additional data sources or verification methods to confirm the outcome of the CBB game between Illinois State and Presbyterian College scheduled for March 22, 2025.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response is factually accurate and logically consistent but must comply with the procedural rules set for first attempt p4 recommendations.\n\n1.

        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.
