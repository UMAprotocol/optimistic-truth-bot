        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Nevada vs. Colorado State game on March 13, 2025. First, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources confirming the game's outcome. Source [1] from Nevada's athletics site states they lost to Colorado State 59-67. Source [2] from CBS Sports also reports Colorado State's win with a final score of 85-78. Wait, there's a discrepancy in the scores here. Let me check other sources. Source [3] mentions a 67-59 victory for Colorado State, and source [4] from the Collegian also confirms the 67-59 score. Source [6] from CSU's official site also states they won 67-59. \n\nHmm, the AP report in source [2] has a different score. Maybe there were two different games? Wait, checking the dates, all sources are from March 13, 2025. Looking closer, source [2] and [3] both reference the Mountain West Conference tournament but have different scores. Let me check the details. Source [3] and [4] mention the quarterfinals, while source [2] also talks about a quarterfinal game. It's possible that there are conflicting reports. However, the official university sites (Nevada and CSU) both report a 67-59 win for Colorado State. The AP article in source [2] might be a different game or a mistake. Wait, source [2] says the game was on March 14, but the URL says 20250313. Maybe a typo. The Nevada article (source [1]) clearly states the 67-59 loss. The CSU article (source [6]) also confirms the 67-59 win. The Collegian (source [4]) also has the same score. The CBS Sports in source [3] also lists the 67-59 score. So the correct outcome is Colorado State winning 67-59. The AP article in source [2] might be an error or a different game, but given multiple consistent sources from both teams and other outlets, the correct result is Colorado State's victory. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Colorado State). No indication of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe March 13, 2025, Mountain West Conference Tournament quarterfinal game between Nevada and Colorado State concluded with Colorado State winning 67-59[1][3][4][6]. Multiple sources confirm the Rams secured victory through strong performances from Nique Clifford (25 points, 14 rebounds) and key second-half adjustments[1][4]. The game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation[1][6]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided (p1: Colorado State, p2: Nevada, p3: 50-50), the market should resolve to **p1** as Colorado State won the game.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event (Nevada vs. Colorado State game) occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. It correctly identifies the winner of the game as Colorado State with a score of 67-59, based on multiple reliable sources including official university sites and sports news outlets. This aligns with the user prompt's requirement to resolve the market based on the game's outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates thorough reasoning by checking multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, addressing discrepancies in reported scores, and ultimately relying on the most consistent and credible sources. The response also correctly disregards the possibility of postponement or cancellation as there were no indications of such events.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for Colorado State's win) directly with the definitions provided in the ancillary data of the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: The response initially identifies a discrepancy in the scores reported by different sources but resolves this by verifying the most consistent information across the majority of credible sources. There is no apparent bias or error in the final analysis and recommendation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the user prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 (Colorado State) is based on verified facts and aligns with the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the event based on multiple reliable sources, addresses discrepancies effectively, and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response demonstrates a thorough and critical approach to verifying the event's outcome and provides a well-reasoned recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
