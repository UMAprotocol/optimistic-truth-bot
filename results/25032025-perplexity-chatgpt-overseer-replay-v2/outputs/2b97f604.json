The ancillary data specifies that if Iona wins, the market resolves to \"Iona\" (p2), if Quinnipiac wins, it's \"Quinnipiac\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 14, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([2], [5], [6], [9], [12]) report that Iona defeated Quinnipiac 81-73 in the MAAC Tournament semifinals on March 14. For example, source [2] from CBS Sports and [9] from Iona's official site both confirm the score and Iona's victory. Additionally, the ESPN scoreboard ([12]) shows the final score as 81-73 in favor of Iona. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All relevant results indicate the game took place as scheduled, and Iona won. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Iona). \n\nI should make sure there's no conflicting information. Other sources like [10] and [14] discuss different games (February and January matchups), which aren't relevant here. The March 14 game is clearly covered in multiple credible sources, all confirming Iona's win. \n\nNo sources suggest any issues with the game's completion or cancellation. Hence, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Iona Gaels defeated the Quinnipiac Bobcats 81-73 in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Tournament semifinal game played on March 14, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. Multiple sources confirm the outcome, including official game recaps from both universities' athletic departments[5][9], ESPN's scoreboard[12], and sports news outlets like CBS Sports and Fox Sports[2][6]. \n\nKey details from the game:\n- Iona led 41-31 at halftime and maintained control despite Quinnipiac's second-half rally\n- Dejour Reaves (23 points) and Adam Njie (21 points) were top performers for Iona\n- Quinnipiac's Amarri Monroe scored a game-high 25 points but couldn't complete the comeback\n\nSince the game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation, and Iona emerged victorious, the market should resolve according to the predetermined conditions for an Iona win.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923578 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:26:18 UTC"
