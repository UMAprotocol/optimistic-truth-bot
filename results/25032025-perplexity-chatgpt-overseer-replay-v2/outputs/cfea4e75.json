The ancillary data specifies that if Oregon wins, it's p1; Indiana wins, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] from CBS Sports clearly states that Oregon won 72-59. The date is March 13, 2025, which matches the game date in the query. The article details the score, key players, and how Oregon pulled away in the second half. Similarly, [2] from ESPN confirms the same score and outcome. [5] from The Columbian and [8] from Daily Emerald also report Oregon's victory with the same score. \n\nThere's a mention in [3] and [6] of predictions where some analysts picked Indiana, but the actual results from multiple sources confirm Oregon's win. The final stats in [7] show the score as 72-59, and the game recap there also aligns with Oregon's victory. \n\nNo sources indicate the game was postponed or canceled. All reports are from after March 13, confirming the game occurred. Therefore, the outcome is clear: Oregon won. According to the resolution conditions, Oregon's win corresponds to p1. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All credible sources agree on the result. Even though some predictions favored Indiana, the actual event's outcome is well-documented. No mentions of cancellations or postponements, so the resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Indiana vs. Oregon men's college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET was played as planned. According to multiple verified sources, **No. 23 Oregon defeated Indiana 72-59** in the Big Ten Tournament second round[1][2][5][8]. Key details:\n\n- Oregon closed the first half with a 10-0 run to lead 37-29 and sealed the win with a late 9-0 surge[1][2]\n- Jackson Shelstad led Oregon with 18 points while Malik Reneau scored 19 for Indiana[1][5]\n- The game was not postponed or canceled, with final stats showing a completed contest[7]\n\nThis outcome triggers the resolution condition where Oregon's victory corresponds to **p1** per the ancillary data terms. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Indiana vs. Oregon CBB game occurred on March 13, 2025, and that Oregon won the game with a score of 72-59. This outcome is supported by multiple credible sources, including CBS Sports and ESPN. The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event date and outcome against the current date, which is March 25, 2025, ensuring the event is in the past and can be resolved.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event date and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly applies the ancillary data terms by mapping Oregon's win to p1. The reasoning is complete as it covers all necessary aspects: event occurrence, outcome verification, and resolution condition application.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through several reliable sources. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for Oregon's win) directly with the verified facts and the specified resolution conditions in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not omit any crucial information necessary for resolving the query. It focuses solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908922 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:22:02 UTC",
