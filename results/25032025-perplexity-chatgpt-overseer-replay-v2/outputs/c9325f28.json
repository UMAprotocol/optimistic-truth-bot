        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Kent State vs. St. Bonaventure basketball game that was scheduled for March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Kent State wins, the market resolves to \"Kent State\" (p2), and if St. Bonaventure wins, it resolves to \"St. Bonaventure\" (p1). If the game is postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [1] from CBS Sports reports the final score as Kent State 75, St. Bonaventure 56. Other sources like [3], [4], and [7] also detail the game's outcome, mentioning Kent State's victory. \n\nNext, I need to verify that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources reference the game happening on March 18, 2025, as scheduled. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. The detailed recaps from both teams' official websites ([3] and [4]) confirm the game was played and completed. \n\nSince the game was played and Kent State won decisively, the market should resolve to p2 according to the resolution conditions. There's no ambiguity here; all sources align on the outcome. The final score and game details are consistent across multiple reports, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nKent State defeated St. Bonaventure 75-56 in their NIT First Round matchup on March 18, 2025[1][3][4][7]. The Golden Flashes overcame an early 12-2 deficit by executing a 15-2 first-half run and dominated the second half with 56% shooting from the field[3][4]. Key performances included:\n\n- **VonCameron Davis** leading with 14 points[1]\n- **Delrecco Gillespie** (12 points, 10 rebounds) and **Cli'Ron Hornbeak** (11 points, 12 rebounds) recording double-doubles[1][7]\n- **Jalen Sullinger** contributing to a second-half surge with critical three-pointers[3][4]\n\nSt. Bonaventure's season ended at 22-12 despite Chance Moore's team-high 16 points[1][4]. The game was completed as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations mentioned in any official reports[1][3][4][7].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908868 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:21:08 UTC"
