The ancillary data specifies that if Kentucky wins, it's p1; if Oklahoma wins, p2; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The search results mention the game was on March 13, 2025, which matches the query. Next, check the outcome. Multiple sources ([1], [5], [6], [9], [10], [12]) report that Kentucky won 85-84. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources discuss the game happening and concluding. \n\nKey points: The final score was Kentucky 85, Oklahoma 84. Otega Oweh hit the game-winning shot with 0.5 seconds left. No indication of postponement or cancellation. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Kentucky). \n\nI need to ensure all conditions are met. The game occurred as scheduled, ended with a Kentucky victory, so the resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Oklahoma vs. Kentucky men's basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET concluded with a **Kentucky victory** (85-84) after Otega Oweh's game-winning basket with 0.5 seconds remaining[1][5][6][9][10][12]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by multiple verified reports of its completion[1][6][8][9]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided:\n- **p1 (Kentucky)** applies since Kentucky won the game\n- No 50-50 resolution (p3) is required, as the game was completed as scheduled\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Logical Reasoning and Completeness:\n   - The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event's date and outcome, then checking for any postponements or cancellations, which there were none.\n   - It provides a complete analysis by covering all potential outcomes (win by either team, postponement, cancellation) and confirming the actual outcome.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The response verifies the event through multiple sources, ensuring the reliability of the outcome reported.\n   - The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Kentucky win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response:\n   - There is no apparent missing information or bias in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n   - No errors are evident in the processing or conclusion of the response.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935197 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:39:57 UTC"
