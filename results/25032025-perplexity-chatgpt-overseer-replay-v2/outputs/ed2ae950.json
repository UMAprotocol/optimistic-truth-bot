        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Greenland\" during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that any mention of the term \"Greenland\" in any context during the meeting counts, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The resolution is based on video evidence of the press conference.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through them one by one. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions Trump vowing to annex Greenland during the meeting with NATO's Mark Rutte. The article quotes him saying, \"We need that for international security\" referring to Greenland. The date here is March 13, 2025, which matches the event date. \n\nResult [2] from SCMP also states that Trump told Rutte the US needs Greenland, directly quoting him. The date is March 14, 2025, but the meeting was on March 13, so this might be a time zone difference. The content still refers to the same meeting.\n\nResult [3] from Geopolitical Economy reports Trump's comments during the March 13 meeting, including his mention of Greenland in the context of international security and military presence. \n\nResult [4] from Telangana Today confirms Trump's statement during the Oval Office meeting, where he said, \"I think it will happen,\" referring to annexation. \n\nResult [5] is a YouTube video from Guardian News, dated March 13, 2025, with the title indicating Trump's mention of NATO's involvement in a Greenland takeover. The transcript includes Trump's direct mention of Greenland during the meeting.\n\nResult [6] from Global News quotes Trump saying, \"I think it will happen\" regarding Greenland's annexation during the meeting with Rutte. \n\nResult [7] from KSBY reports Trump explaining to Rutte that the US \"needed\" Greenland for international security during their March 13 meeting. \n\nResult [8] from Common Dreams includes Trump's remarks about Greenland during the press conference, including his interaction with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. \n\nResult [9] from Euronews details the exchange where Trump mentions Greenland and Rutte responds, confirming the term was used. \n\nResult [10] from Global News again quotes Trump's statements about Greenland during the meeting, leading to Greenland's rejection. \n\nResult [12] is a transcript from a January 2025 press conference where Trump discusses Greenland, but this is before the March meeting, so it's not relevant here. \n\nResults [13], [14], and [15] discuss broader contexts but still reference Trump's mention of Greenland during the March 13 meeting.\n\nMultiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]) confirm that Trump explicitly mentioned \"Greenland\" during the March 13, 2025 meeting with NATO's Secretary General. The term is used in its base form, satisfying the resolution conditions. There's no indication the event was canceled or unaired. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did say \"Greenland\" during his March 13, 2025 Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Multiple sources confirm Trump explicitly referenced Greenland in the context of national security and potential annexation[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Key evidence includes:\n\n**Verbatim statements from the meeting:**\n- \"We need that for international security\" (referring to Greenland)[1][2][7]\n- \"I think it will happen\" (regarding annexation)[4][6][9]\n- Direct discussion about existing U.S. military bases in Greenland[3][8]\n\nThe meeting occurred as scheduled and was covered by major news outlets[5][9][10]. While NATO's Rutte declined to engage on the Greenland issue[1][3][8], Trump repeatedly used the exact term \"Greenland\" during the discussion[2][4][6][9]. This satisfies the resolution conditions requiring any usage of the term itself during the specified event.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Donald Trump mentioned \"Greenland\" during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025, appears to be thorough and well-supported by multiple sources. The response adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt, which requires factual verification of events that have already occurred and are supported by reliable sources.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's requirement to verify whether the term \"Greenland\" was mentioned by Donald Trump during the specified meeting. The AI has provided multiple sources confirming that Trump did indeed mention \"Greenland,\" which aligns with the resolution conditions stated in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with a verification of the event date and details, followed by a detailed examination of various sources that confirm the mention of \"Greenland.\" The AI systematically addresses each source, ensuring that the information is relevant and directly related to the specific event in question.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms that the meeting took place as scheduled and was not canceled or unaired. It verifies the occurrence of the event and the context of the mention of \"Greenland\" as per the user prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) is based on concrete evidence from multiple reliable sources.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The AI does not include irrelevant information and focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt. All sources cited are relevant to the event and confirm the mention of \"Greenland\" during the meeting.\n\nGiven the detailed verification and adherence to the user prompt and system instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) is well-supported and justified based on the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response is accurate, well-supported by multiple sources, and adheres strictly to the user prompt and system instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively verifies the mention of 'Greenland' during the specified event using multiple reliable sources, aligning perfectly with the resolution conditions.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930810 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:26:50 UTC",
