        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Trump released the JFK files by March 18, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the deadline: March 18, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the event has already passed. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating that the Trump administration did release the files on March 18. For example, source [2] from CBS News on March 17 mentions Trump's announcement that the files would be released on Tuesday, March 18. Then, source [5] from CBS News on March 19 confirms the release of 80,000 pages that day. Additionally, source [8] from Axios on March 18 and [10] from the DNI's official release on March 18 both state that the files were released as per the executive order. \n\nThe key points are: the release happened on the specified date, the documents were declassified, and official government sources like the National Archives and the DNI confirmed it. There's no mention of the release being delayed past the deadline or not happening. Even though some documents were already public with redactions, the new release included previously classified materials without redactions, which fits the market's condition. \n\nSince all credible sources and official statements confirm the release by the deadline, the resolution should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump's administration declassified and released approximately 80,000 pages of previously classified JFK assassination records on March 18, 2025, meeting the market's resolution deadline[2][5][8][10]. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) began publishing the unredacted documents online and in-person that day, fulfilling the requirements of Trump's January 23 executive order[10]. While some IRS records remain withheld[5], the release included key CIA operational details about Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City and fulfilled the market's core condition of declassifying \"any previously classified files\" by the deadline[5][8].\n\nThis action followed through on Trump's repeated campaign promises to release the documents[1][6], with the Director of National Intelligence confirming full compliance[10]. The release occurred despite earlier skepticism about implementation speed[3][6] and included newly discovered FBI records[2][11].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm that the event in question occurred as described in the user prompt, and it adheres to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and established sources.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it systematically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event has passed. It then proceeds to verify the occurrence of the event through multiple credible sources, which report on the release of the JFK files by the Trump administration on the specified date. The response also correctly identifies that the release included previously classified materials, which aligns with the market's condition for resolution.\n\nThe recommendation of p2 (Yes) is aligned with the facts presented and the conditions outlined in the user prompt. The response does not show any significant bias or errors. It strictly adheres to the event specifics and uses the correct sources for verification, as required by the system prompt.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the response could improve by explicitly stating that no contradictory information was found regarding the release being delayed or not meeting the specified conditions. This would strengthen the confidence in the recommendation by explicitly confirming the absence of any conflicting reports.\n\nOverall, the response is satisfactory as it stands, but a minor improvement could be made by adding a statement to confirm the absence of contradictory information.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event against the user prompt conditions and uses multiple credible sources to confirm the event's occurrence as described.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response could be improved by explicitly confirming the absence of any contradictory reports to further strengthen the confidence in the resolution recommendation.\"\n}\n```",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929955 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:12:35 UTC"
