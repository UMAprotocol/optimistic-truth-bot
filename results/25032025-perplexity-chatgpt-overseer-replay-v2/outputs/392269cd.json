The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the NBA game between the Utah Jazz and Memphis Grizzlies scheduled for March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Jazz win, it resolves to \"Jazz\" (p2), and if the Grizzlies win, it resolves to \"Grizzlies\" (p1). The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event date is in the past. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results [1], [3], [4], [6], [7], and [8] all mention the game took place on March 12, 2025. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so the game happened. \n\nNext, determine the outcome. Multiple sources report the Grizzlies won 122-115. For example, [1] states \"Memphis Grizzlies top the Utah Jazz 122-115,\" and [4] confirms the same score. The box score in [6] and [8] also shows the final score as Grizzlies 122, Jazz 115. \n\nSince the game was played and the Grizzlies won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Grizzlies). There's no conflicting information about the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Utah Jazz and Memphis Grizzlies scheduled for March 12, 2025, concluded with a **122-115 victory for the Memphis Grizzlies**[1][3][4][6][8]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Luke Kennard** led the Grizzlies with 30 points (7/9 from three-point range), while **Ja Morant** added 28 points and hit a critical three-pointer with 12 seconds remaining to seal the win[1][3].\n- The Jazz, despite strong performances from **Collin Sexton** (22 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists) and **John Collins** (22 points), committed 23 turnovers and went 12/34 from three-point range compared to Memphis' 20/44[1][6][8].\n- The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by multiple verified reports of the completed matchup[1][3][4][6][8].\n\nGiven the Grizzlies' confirmed victory and the absence of any postponement or cancellation, the market resolves to **\"Grizzlies\"** per the ancillary data terms. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It provides a detailed account of the game, including performances by key players, which supports the final score and outcome reported.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response ensures that the event discussed is the exact event mentioned in the user prompt. It uses verified sources to confirm the details of the game and its outcome, which aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt for resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and does not include unnecessary or irrelevant information.\n\nGiven the above points, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
