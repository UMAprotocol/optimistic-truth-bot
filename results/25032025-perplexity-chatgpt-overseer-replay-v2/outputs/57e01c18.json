The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the UFC fight between Chidi Njokuani and Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos that happened on March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Njokuani wins, it's p2, and if Zaleski dos Santos wins, it's p1. The resolution source is ESPN, but credible reports can be used.\n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The fight was on March 15, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 25, 2025. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [5] from RotoBaller states that Njokuani won by a second-round TKO. Source [8] from Athlon Sports also confirms the TKO victory for Njokuani in the co-main event. Additionally, source [10] from Fightful lists the result as Njokuani winning by TKO (strikes) in Round 2. These are all credible sources reporting the same outcome. \n\nESPN's profile on Zaleski dos Santos (source [4]) was updated after the fight and shows the result as a KO/TKO loss for him against Njokuani. This aligns with the other reports. \n\nAll the sources agree that Njokuani was the winner. There's no mention of a draw or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2, which corresponds to Njokuani's victory.\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night bout between Chidi Njokuani and Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos occurred on March 15, 2025, as scheduled. Multiple credible sources confirm that **Chidi Njokuani** won the fight via second-round TKO (knee and elbows) at 2:19 of Round 2[5][8][10]. This outcome is reflected in official UFC results and corroborated by sports media outlets like ESPN[4], Athlon Sports[8], and Fightful[10].  \n\nGiven the resolution conditions:  \n- **p2** corresponds to Njokuani's victory  \n- No evidence of postponement, cancellation, or draw exists  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (UFC Fight Night bout between Chidi Njokuani and Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos) and its date (March 15, 2025). It correctly notes that the event has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). The response uses multiple credible sources (RotoBaller, Athlon Sports, Fightful, and ESPN) to verify the outcome of the fight, which is consistent with the user prompt's requirement to use ESPN or a consensus of credible reporting.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the sources, confirming that Chidi Njokuani won by second-round TKO. It correctly matches this outcome with the resolution condition (p2 corresponds to Njokuani's victory) provided in the ancillary data. The response also correctly identifies that there is no evidence of a draw, cancellation, or postponement, thus ruling out the resolution to p3.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is not based on a single source. This thorough verification aligns well with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response adheres strictly to the user prompt and system prompt instructions, using the specified sources and conditions for resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 is well-supported by the verified facts and aligns with the ancillary data conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple credible sources, aligns with the resolution conditions, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses credible sources to confirm the event outcome and logically matches this outcome with the specified resolution conditions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906963 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:49:23 UTC"
