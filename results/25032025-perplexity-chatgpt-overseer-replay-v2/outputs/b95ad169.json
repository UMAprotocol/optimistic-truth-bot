        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Canadiens vs. Islanders game on March 20, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Islanders win, it's p1; Canadiens win, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game in question has already occurred. Looking at the search results, all sources from [1] to [10] report that the game took place on March 20, 2025. The key detail is the result: multiple sources mention Bo Horvat scoring in overtime to give the Islanders a 4-3 victory. For example, [1] states, \"Bo Horvat scored his second goal of the game 3:37 into overtime to lift the New York Islanders past the Montreal Canadiens 4-3.\" This is corroborated by [2], [3], [4], and others.\n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having been played, with detailed recaps and stats, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions don't apply to those scenarios here.\n\nSince the Islanders won the game, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p1. There's no ambiguity here; all sources agree on the outcome. Even though the Canadiens forced overtime, the Islanders secured the win in OT, which counts as a regulation win for market purposes. No conflicting information exists in the search results, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Islanders on March 20, 2025, concluded with a **4-3 overtime victory for the New York Islanders**[1][2][3][4]. Bo Horvat scored the game-winning goal 3:37 into overtime, securing the Islanders' third consecutive win and narrowing the gap to two points behind the Canadiens in the Eastern Conference wild-card race[5][6][7]. \n\nKey details confirming the outcome:\n- The Islanders led 3-1 in the third period before Montreal tied the game, forcing overtime[8][9].\n- Ilya Sorokin made 38 saves and recorded two assists, while Sam Montembeault stopped 21 shots for the Canadiens[10][4].\n- The game was played as scheduled, with no postponement or cancellation mentioned in any reports[1][2][3][4].\n\n**Resolution**: The New York Islanders won the game, so the market resolves to **p1** (Islanders).  \nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934347 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:25:47 UTC"
