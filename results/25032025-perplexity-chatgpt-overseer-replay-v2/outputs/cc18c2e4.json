        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the Akron vs. Arizona basketball game. The response adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt, which emphasizes the need to base the resolution on verified facts about events that have already occurred.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game took place on March 21, 2025, and that Arizona won against Akron with a score of 93-65. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution condition that if Arizona wins, the market should resolve to \"p1\". The response also correctly notes that the game was neither postponed nor canceled, which matches the conditions outlined for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the occurrence of the event and confirming the outcome through multiple sources. It then aligns this outcome with the specified resolution condition (p1 for an Arizona win). The response is complete as it addresses all potential outcomes (win, postponement, cancellation) and confirms the actual outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, which is a strong point in ensuring the reliability of the resolution. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"p1\" is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the user prompt's conditions without introducing any irrelevant information or subjective interpretation.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the requirements set forth in the system prompt. It provides a clear, factual, and well-supported resolution based on the event's verified outcome.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the verified outcome of the event, adhering strictly to the user prompt's conditions and system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to verify the event's outcome and aligns the resolution recommendation precisely with the ancillary data provided.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909948 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:39:08 UTC",
