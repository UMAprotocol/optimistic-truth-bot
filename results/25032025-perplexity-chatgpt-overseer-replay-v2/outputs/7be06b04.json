        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Mineral\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she uses that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The deadline is December 31, 2025, and if she's no longer press secretary by then, it's \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the latest information about her upcoming briefings. The current date is March 25, 2025. The search results include several briefings up to March 19, 2025. The most recent mention of a briefing is on March 19 (result 10 and 11), where she discussed moving beyond the minerals deal to focus on a ceasefire. There's also a mention of a briefing on March 5 (result 17) and March 17 (result 7), but those are earlier. \n\nLooking at the ancillary data, the key term is \"Mineral\". The user specified that plural or possessive forms count, but other forms don't. The term must be spoken by Leavitt in the next briefing she participates in. If no briefing happens by the deadline, it's \"No\". Also, if she's no longer press secretary by then, it's \"No\".\n\nFrom the search results, there's a lot of discussion about a minerals deal with Ukraine, especially in results 6, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, and 19. In these, Leavitt frequently uses the term \"minerals\" when referring to the deal. For example, in result 10, she mentions \"economic minerals deal\" and \"minerals deal framework\". However, the exact term \"mineral\" in singular form isn't found in the transcripts provided. She uses \"minerals\" (plural) multiple times.\n\nThe user's query is about the singular \"Mineral\". The resolution conditions state that pluralization counts. Wait, the description says: \"Pluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution...\". So if the term is \"Mineral\", then \"minerals\" (plural) would count. The user's listed term is \"Mineral\", but the plural is allowed. So if she says \"minerals\", that should count as a \"Yes\".\n\nLooking at the latest briefings, in the March 19 briefing (result 10 and 11), she says \"moved beyond just the economic minerals deal framework\" and refers to the \"minerals deal\" multiple times. So in her next briefing, if she continues to discuss this topic, she's likely to use \"minerals\" again. However, the next briefing after March 19 isn't detailed in the search results. The user is asking about the \"next\" briefing after the current date of March 25. Since the latest info is up to March 19, we don't have data beyond that. \n\nBut the market is about the next briefing she participates in. If there's a briefing scheduled after March 25, but before the deadline, and she uses \"minerals\", then it's \"Yes\". However, without information on future briefings, we can't be certain. However, given her history of discussing the minerals deal frequently, and the ongoing negotiations (as per result 18 and 19), it's probable that in her next briefing, she'll mention \"minerals\" again. \n\nBut wait, the query's term is \"Mineral\", and the plural is allowed. So \"minerals\" would count. Therefore, if she says \"minerals\", the market resolves to \"Yes\". Based on her track record, she's likely to continue discussing the minerals deal, making it probable that she'll use the term. However, if the next briefing hasn't happened yet (current date is March 25), and the user is asking about the next one, we need to check if there's any info on upcoming briefings. \n\nResult 6 is a YouTube video from March 25, 2025, titled \"White House Press Secretary Gives New Shock to Zelensky | Trump ...\". The transcript snippet mentions Leavitt discussing talks about a mineral rights deal with Ukraine. The exact term \"mineral rights\" is used here. \"Mineral\" is part of the compound term \"mineral rights\", which according to the resolution conditions, counts because it's a compound word. The user's conditions state that compound words count regardless of context. So \"mineral\" in \"mineral rights\" would trigger a \"Yes\".\n\nTherefore, in the March 25 briefing (result 6), she used \"mineral rights\", which includes the term \"mineral\". Thus, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). However, the user's current date is March 25, 12:19 PM UTC, and the video is from March 24 or 25 (the date is a bit unclear). The transcript in result 6 mentions \"Mar 24, 2025\" but the video's actual date might be March 25. Assuming the next briefing after March 19 is the one on March 25 where she discusses \"mineral rights\", then the term \"mineral\" is used in a compound word, which counts. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths and weaknesses in addressing the user's query about whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Mineral\" during her next White House press briefing.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies the conditions under which the market will resolve to \"Yes\" or \"No,\" including the allowance for pluralization and possessive forms of the word \"Mineral.\"\n   - The response correctly notes that the term \"mineral\" in the compound word \"mineral rights\" counts towards the resolution, adhering to the user's conditions that compound words count.\n   - The response identifies that the next briefing after the current date (March 25, 2025) is the relevant event for resolution, which aligns with the user's prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The response provides a thorough analysis of past briefings and the usage of the term \"minerals.\" It logically deduces that since \"minerals\" (plural) has been used frequently, it is likely to be used again.\n   - The response identifies a specific instance (\"mineral rights\") from a briefing on the current date, which includes the term \"mineral.\" This is a critical piece of information that directly impacts the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response correctly identifies that the briefing on March 25, where \"mineral rights\" was discussed, is the next briefing after the most recent one noted before the current date. This is crucial for determining the resolution based on the exact event specified in the user prompt.\n   - The response concludes that since \"mineral rights\" includes the term \"mineral,\" and compound words count, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The response does not appear to have significant bias or errors. It methodically checks for the usage of the term in question and adheres closely to the conditions set out in the user prompt.\n   - The response could improve by confirming the exact date and time of the March 25 briefing to ensure that it is indeed the next briefing after March 19. This would solidify the recommendation by removing any ambiguity about the timing of the events.\n\nOverall, the response is thorough and aligns well with the user's conditions and the factual information available. It demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements and provides a logical recommendation based on the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the conditions for resolution, correctly applies the rules to the usage of the term 'mineral' in the context of the briefing, and provides a logical recommendation based on the evidence.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-aligned with the user's prompt and conditions. It could be improved by confirming the exact timing of the March 25 briefing to ensure it is the next event after March 19.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905067 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:17:47 UTC",
