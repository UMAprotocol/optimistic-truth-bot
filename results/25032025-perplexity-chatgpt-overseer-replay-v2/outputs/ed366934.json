        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Nebraska Omaha vs. St. John's basketball game. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided sources. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 20, 2025, so it's in the past. That means I don't have to worry about future events; I need to confirm if the game happened and who won.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. The most crucial one is result [15], which is a news article from St. John's official athletics website. It states that St. John's won 83-53. That's a definitive source, so that's solid evidence. Other sources like [13] and [14] also predicted a St. John's victory, but the actual result in [15] confirms it.\n\nI also need to check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. None of the sources indicate that. The official report in [15] clearly states the game was played and the result. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the game is completed, the resolution is based on the winner. Since St. John's won, the resolution should be p1. There's no ambiguity here because the game was played, and the result is verified by an official source. \n\nI should also consider the house rules from source [8], which mention that if a game is completed, bets are settled based on the official result. Since the game was played and the result is clear, there's no need for a 50-50 resolution. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1 for St. John's.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Nebraska Omaha and St. John's occurred as scheduled on March 20, 2025, at 9:45 PM ET. According to the official game recap from St. John's athletics[15], the #2-seeded Red Storm defeated #15 Omaha 83-53 in the NCAA Tournament First Round. This result set a program record for St. John's with their 31st win of the season and marked their largest margin of victory in NCAA Tournament history.\n\nKey details confirming the outcome:\n- Final score: St. John's 83, Nebraska Omaha 53[15]\n- The game was played to completion with no postponements or cancellations mentioned in any sources\n- Multiple pre-game predictions[1][13][14] aligned with the actual result, though only the official post-game report provides definitive verification\n\nBased on the resolution conditions defined in the ancillary data and the verified outcome, this market resolves to **\"St. John's\"** as the winning team. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It verifies the outcome of the Nebraska Omaha vs. St. John's basketball game using a reliable source, specifically the official athletics website of St. John's, which is appropriate and adheres to the instructions to use verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event's occurrence and then verifying the winner based on the official source. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which aligns with the prompt's requirements to consider these aspects. The reasoning is thorough and leads to a clear, supported conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the game occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for St. John's win) with the verified outcome and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies how the market should resolve based on different outcomes.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the provided instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925593 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:59:53 UTC"
