        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Heat vs. Knicks game scheduled for March 17, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Knicks win, it's p1; Heat win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled resolves 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 17, so the event date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [1] mentions the Knicks' win on March 18, 2025 (probably a typo, but the game date is March 17). Source [9] from ESPN clearly states the Knicks won 116-95. Other sources like [8], [10], [13], and [14] also confirm the Knicks' victory with the same score. \n\nNext, check for any postponement or cancellation. The search results don't mention any delays or cancellations. Instead, they all discuss the game as having been played. Source [3] talks about policies for postponed games, but there's no indication this game was affected. \n\nThe resolution conditions require verifying the outcome. All sources agree the Knicks won decisively. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Miami Heat vs. New York Knicks game scheduled for March 17, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET was played as planned, with the Knicks defeating the Heat 116-95[1][9][10][13]. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred without postponement or cancellation, including detailed box scores[8][9] and post-game analysis[12][14]. Karl-Anthony Towns (23 points) and Mikal Bridges (28 points) led the Knicks' comeback from a 12-0 deficit, while Josh Hart recorded a triple-double (12 PTS/13 REB/11 AST)[9][13]. The Heat extended their losing streak to eight games[9][12].\n\n**Key resolution factors:**\n- **Game completion:** Played in full with no postponement/cancellation[3][9]\n- **Outcome verification:** Multiple independent sources confirm Knicks victory[1][8][9][10][13]\n- **Ancillary data alignment:** Knicks win corresponds to **p1** resolution per market terms\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Confirming the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp.\n2. Verifying the occurrence and outcome of the event through multiple independent sources.\n3. Ensuring that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data (p1 for a Knicks win).\n\nThe response is logically sound and complete as it checks for any possible postponements or cancellations and confirms none occurred, which matches the conditions outlined for resolution. It also provides detailed information about key players and game highlights, which, while not necessary for the resolution, enriches the context and confirms the thoroughness of the event verification.\n\nThere are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information critical to the resolution of the query. The response uses a clear and direct approach to establish the facts and aligns the recommendation with the verified outcome.\n\nBased on the evaluation:\n- The factual accuracy is upheld with multiple sources confirming the Knicks' victory.\n- The logical reasoning is sound, following the instructions to verify the event's occurrence and outcome.\n- The verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are correctly executed.\n\nTherefore, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources and aligns the resolution recommendation correctly with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, verifies the event accurately, and provides a well-supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
