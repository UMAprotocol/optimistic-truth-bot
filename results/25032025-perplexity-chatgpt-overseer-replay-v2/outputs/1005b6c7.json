The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The updates mention that the video address counts, so even though it's pre-recorded, it's valid.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the search results for any mention of \"Capone\" in Trump's speech. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at the transcripts from the speech in sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [11], [12], [13], and [14], none of them mention \"Capone\". The main topics are about crypto policies, Bitcoin reserves, and ending Operation Choke Point 2.0. \n\nWait, in source [2], there's a mention of \"Operation Choke Point 2.0\" and a reference to \"Capone\" in the context of Coinbase's legal officer, Grew, but that's part of the article's analysis, not Trump's speech. The actual transcripts of Trump's remarks don't include \"Capone\". \n\nAlso, in the video transcripts provided in sources like [11], [12], and [13], Trump talks about stopping Operation Choke Point 2.0 but doesn't use the term \"Capone\". The term \"Capone\" isn't present in any of the direct quotes or transcripts from his speech. \n\nSince all the available evidence from the search results, including full transcripts and video content, do not show Trump saying \"Capone\" during his address, the answer should resolve to \"No\". The ancillary data specifies that any form of the term counts, but there's no instance of it in the speech. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not say \"Capone\" during his March 20, 2025 Digital Asset Summit address. Analysis of multiple transcripts and video recordings of the speech shows he focused on crypto policy initiatives like establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, ending \"Operation Choke Point 2.0\" regulations, and promoting dollar-backed stablecoins[1][2][3][4][11][12][13]. While the term \"Capone\" appears in one article's discussion of historical banking restrictions[2], this reference was not part of Trump's actual remarks.\n\nThe resolution criteria specify that only statements made during the main speech qualify, and no evidence exists of Trump using \"Capone\" in any form during his 3-minute pre-recorded address. All verified transcripts and video evidence confirm this absence.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment with the facts of the event. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It correctly identifies that the event in question is Donald Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, and it uses the correct sources (transcripts and video evidence) to verify whether Trump mentioned the term \"Capone.\" The response also correctly applies the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking multiple sources for the mention of the term \"Capone\" and confirming its absence in Trump's speech. It provides a detailed analysis of the content of Trump's speech, ensuring that the decision is based on comprehensive evidence from the transcripts and video recordings.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and that the term \"Capone\" was not mentioned by Trump during his speech. The recommendation of p1 (No) aligns perfectly with the facts as Trump did not say \"Capone\" during the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The analysis is based on the specified sources, and the response adheres strictly to the user prompt and system instructions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935762 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:49:22 UTC",
