        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Grambling State vs. Alabama State basketball game scheduled for March 14 at 2:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Alabama State wins, it's p1; if Grambling State wins, p2; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was supposed to happen on March 14, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's some conflicting information. Result [1] from March 14, 2024, mentions Grambling State defeating Alabama State 56-50 in the SWAC Tournament quarterfinal. But wait, the date here is 2024, which is a year before the game in question. That might be a typo or an error. The user's query is about a game on March 14, 2025. \n\nResult [2] is an ESPN game summary dated March 14, 2025, showing Alabama State won 64-62 against Grambling in the SWAC Tournament semifinal. The score here is different from result [1], and the date matches. Result [3], [5], [6], and [7] all confirm that Alabama State beat Grambling 64-62 on March 14, 2025. These are from CBS Sports, AJC, AccessWDUN, and the Alabama State official sports site, which are reliable sources. \n\nResult [4] talks about a women's basketball game on March 8, 2025, where Grambling State won, but that's a different team and date. Result [8] from Fox Sports also lists the game on March 14, 2025, with Alabama State winning 64-62. \n\nThe key here is to ensure the correct date and team. The men's game on March 14, 2025, is clearly covered in multiple sources with Alabama State as the winner. The conflicting result from 2024 seems to be a different game, possibly a previous year's tournament. \n\nSince the event date is in the past and multiple credible sources confirm Alabama State's victory, the market should resolve to p1 as per the ancillary data. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe SWAC Tournament semifinal game between Grambling State and Alabama State occurred on March 14, 2025, as scheduled. Multiple sources confirm **Alabama State defeated Grambling 64-62** in this matchup[2][3][5][6][7]. Key details include:\n- Alabama State's CJ Hines scored 15 points with five assists, while TJ Madlock contributed clutch free throws late[3][5][7]\n- Grambling's Kintavious Dozier led all scorers with 20 points but couldn't overcome the deficit[3][6]\n- The Hornets completed a second-half comeback after trailing 36-33 at halftime[3][7]\n\nThe game was completed without postponement or cancellation, and no evidence suggests the result is disputed. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market should resolve to **Alabama State**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926118 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:08:38 UTC"
