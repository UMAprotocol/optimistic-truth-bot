        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Jacksonville State vs. Georgia Tech game on March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Jacksonville State wins, it's p2; if Georgia Tech wins, p1; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened a week ago. Next, I need to confirm the actual outcome. Looking at the search results:\n\nSearch result [1] from ajc.com states Georgia Tech lost 81-64 to Jacksonville State. The date is March 18, 2025, which matches the game date. The article details the score and mentions Jacksonville State's strong performance, including 15 three-pointers. \n\nResult [2] from jaxstatesports.com also confirms Jacksonville State's 81-64 win, highlighting their 15 three-pointers and it being their second win over a power conference team. \n\nResult [6] from CBS Sports and [7] from ESPN both report the same score, with Jaron Pierre Jr. scoring 30 points for Jacksonville State. These are reliable sources, so the outcome is clear. \n\nAdditionally, the YouTube video in result [3] is titled as a March 18 game, though the description is more about highlights than the score. However, the other sources are sufficient. \n\nThe betting prediction in [4] had Georgia Tech as favorites, but the actual result was an upset. All credible sources agree Jacksonville State won. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nSince the event occurred and Jacksonville State won, the resolution should be p2. All conditions are met, and the sources are consistent. No conflicting information found.\n</think>\n\nJacksonville State defeated Georgia Tech 81-64 in their NIT first-round game on March 18, 2025, at McCamish Pavilion. The Gamecocks dominated from the start, shooting 51.7% from the field and making 15 three-pointers[1][2][6]. Jaron Pierre Jr. led Jacksonville State with 30 points, seven assists, and three steals, while Marcellus Brigham Jr. added 16 points[6][7]. Georgia Tech, finishing the season 17-17, was outrebounded 41-30 and struggled defensively, with Duncan Powell and Lance Terry each scoring 15 points[1][8]. The win marked Jacksonville State's first NIT victory in program history and head coach Ray Harper's 600th career win[2][6].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929788 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:09:48 UTC"
