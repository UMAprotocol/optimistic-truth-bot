The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key source here is result [5], which is the transcript of the meeting between Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on March 13, 2025. Let me look through that. \n\nIn the transcript, Trump mentions \"the United Kingdom\" explicitly. He says, \"One, the United Kingdom was grateful for the Trump administration's...\" when discussing defense spending. That's a direct use of \"United Kingdom\". \n\nThe query specifies that any usage of the terms \"UK\" or \"United Kingdom\" counts, including possessive or plural forms. Here, \"United Kingdom\" is used as is. The meeting in question is the one on March 13, and the transcript from the White House website (source [5]) confirms this. \n\nAlso, the event wasn't canceled and was aired, so the resolution isn't affected by that clause. The mention occurs during the meeting, not in preceding speeches, which aligns with the market's conditions. \n\nNo other forms or compound words are involved here. Since Trump used \"United Kingdom\" during the meeting, the answer should be \"Yes\", corresponding to p2.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided search results, during the March 13, 2025 meeting between President Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump explicitly used the term \"United Kingdom\" when discussing defense spending commitments. In the official transcript from the White House website, he stated:\n\n**\"One, the United Kingdom was grateful for the Trump administration's...\"** [5]\n\nThis meets the resolution criteria as:\n1. The term \"United Kingdom\" was used verbatim during the Oval Office meeting\n2. The usage occurred in the context of the scheduled bilateral meeting (not preceding speeches)\n3. The meeting occurred as planned and was publicly documented\n\nThe resolution conditions specify that any usage of either \"UK\" or \"United Kingdom\" qualifies, with plural/possessive forms accepted. While Trump didn't use the abbreviated \"UK,\" his explicit reference to \"United Kingdom\" satisfies the requirements.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906712 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:45:12 UTC",
