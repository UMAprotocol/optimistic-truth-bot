        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Bulls vs. Suns game scheduled for March 19, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Suns win, it's p1; Bulls win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled entirely resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 19, so the event date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [5], [8]) report that the Suns defeated the Bulls 127-121 on March 19. For example, source [1] from YouTube highlights the Suns' win, and source [4] from ESPN provides a detailed recap confirming the Suns' victory with Booker scoring 41 points. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The search results include a mention of a postponed game between the Hawks and Rockets in January 2025 ([3]), but that's unrelated. There's no indication in the provided sources that the Bulls vs. Suns game was postponed or canceled. All relevant sources discuss the game as having taken place with a clear result. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that a Suns win resolves to p1. Since multiple credible sources confirm the Suns' victory, the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information about the game's status, so p3 isn't applicable. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nThe Phoenix Suns defeated the Chicago Bulls 127-121 in their March 19, 2025, NBA game, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][4][5]. Devin Booker led the Suns with 41 points, including 20 in the fourth quarter, while Kevin Durant added 26 points and eight assists[1][4]. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with no indications of unresolved conditions affecting the outcome[1][2][4][5]. \n\n**Resolution:** The market resolves to **p1 (Suns)** based on their confirmed victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907011 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:50:11 UTC"
