The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Dallas Stars vs. Winnipeg Jets game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Jets win, it's p1; if the Stars win, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 14, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, multiple reports confirm the result. Search result [1] from CBS Sports states the Jets won 4-1. Similarly, [5] from NHL.com and [8] from ESPN both report the same score. Other sources like [2], [6], [9], [11], and [12] also mention the Jets' 4-1 victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nAll sources agree on the Jets' win, with details like Kyle Connor scoring two goals and Connor Hellebuyck making 24 saves. The Stars' only goal came from Mason Marchment late in the third period. Since the game was played as scheduled and the Jets won, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information or indications of cancellation/postponement found.\n</think>\n\nThe Dallas Stars and Winnipeg Jets played their scheduled NHL game on March 14, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. According to multiple verified sources, the **Winnipeg Jets defeated the Dallas Stars 4-1**[1][5][8][11]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Kyle Connor** led the Jets with two goals and one assist, reaching 35 goals for the season[1][5][8].\n- **Connor Hellebuyck** made 24 saves, improving his record to 39-9-3[2][6].\n- The Jets extended their Central Division lead to 10 points over the Stars[1][6][8].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no evidence suggests irregularities in its completion. All sources confirm the Jets' decisive victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Jets win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response adheres to the system prompt instructions by:\n1. Checking the current date to confirm that the event is in the past.\n2. Verifying the outcome of the event through multiple sources.\n3.

Aligning the resolution recommendation (p1) directly with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The logical reasoning is sound, and the verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response uses a clear and direct approach to resolve the query based on the established facts and conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event outcome and makes a clear, accurate recommendation based on the user prompt conditions.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
