The ancillary data specifies that if Bradley wins, it's p1; North Alabama, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Checking the search results, multiple sources [1][2][4][6] report that Bradley won 71-62. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as it's described as a completed NIT first-round match. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the event details match the query. The game was indeed on March 19 at 8 PM ET, as per source [8]. All sources agree on the final score and Bradley's victory. There's no mention of the game being rescheduled or canceled. \n\nSince Bradley won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information found in the sources. All evidence points to a clear Bradley victory, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nBradley defeated North Alabama 71-62 in the NIT First Round game played on March 19, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET[1][2][4][6]. The game was completed as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with Bradley leading 39-21 at halftime and maintaining their advantage despite a second-half push from North Alabama[2][4]. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Bradley's Darius Hannah led scoring with 17 points off the bench[1][4]\n- North Alabama's Donte Bacchus scored 19 points in the second half rally[2][4]\n- Bradley advanced to face George Mason in the NIT Second Round[2][4]\n\nThe outcome meets the resolution condition specifying Bradley wins (p1) as the market resolution. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the requirement of verifying the outcome of a past event, specifically the North Alabama vs. Bradley basketball game, and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game occurred on March 19, 2025, and verifies through multiple sources that Bradley won the game. This outcome matches the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"p1\" if Bradley wins. The response does not attempt to predict or assume outcomes but relies on verified sources to confirm the event's result.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date and outcome of the event, followed by confirming the details match the user prompt. It then concludes with a recommendation based on the verified outcome. The response includes specific details about the game, such as the score and key players, which supports the credibility of the sources and the verification process.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event against reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the facts. The recommendation of \"p1\" is directly tied to the verified outcome of Bradley winning the game.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt and does not include irrelevant or unverified information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified outcome of the event and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the North Alabama vs. Bradley basketball game and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925303 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:55:03 UTC",
