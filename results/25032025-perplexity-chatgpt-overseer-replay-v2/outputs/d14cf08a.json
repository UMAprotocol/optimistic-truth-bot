        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Panthers vs. Blue Jackets game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Panthers win, it's p2; if the Blue Jackets win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open until completion; and if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether the game actually took place as scheduled. The current date is March 26, 2025, which is after March 20, so the game should have already happened. Let me check the search results for any reports on the game's outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the game occurred. Source [9] is an NHL.com recap titled \"Barkov lifts Panthers past Blue Jackets in OT\" dated March 21, 2025. It mentions that the Panthers won 1-0 in overtime. Similarly, source [11] from ESPN's recap on March 21, 2025, confirms the same score and outcome. Source [13] from thescore.com lists the final score as 1-0 in overtime for the Panthers. Additionally, source [16] is a YouTube video titled \"NHL Highlights | Panthers vs. Blue Jackets - March 20, 2025\" which shows Sergei Bobrovsky's shutout and Aleksander Barkov's game-winning goal. \n\nAll these sources consistently report that the Florida Panthers won the game against the Columbus Blue Jackets on March 20. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The game went into overtime, but it was completed on the same day without any delays beyond the regular schedule. \n\nSince the game was played and the Panthers won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Panthers\"). There's no indication of cancellation or postponement that would trigger p3 or keep the market open. All sources agree on the outcome, so the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Florida Panthers defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 1-0 in overtime on March 20, 2025[9][11][13]. Aleksander Barkov scored the game-winning power-play goal 29 seconds into overtime, while Sergei Bobrovsky recorded a 25-save shutout against his former team[9][11]. The game was completed as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations reported[9][11][13].\n\nBased on the resolution conditions:\n- **Panthers win** (p2): The market resolves to this outcome as Florida secured the victory[9][11][13]\n- No 50-50 resolution (p3) is required since the game was played to completion\n- The overtime result counts as a regulation win for resolution purposes under NHL rules\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985435 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:37:15 UTC"
