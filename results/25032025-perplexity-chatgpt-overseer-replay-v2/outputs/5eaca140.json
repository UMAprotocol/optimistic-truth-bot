The ancillary data specifies that if the Pacers win, it's p2; if the Timberwolves win, p1; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 17 is definitely in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome of that specific game. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] states the Pacers defeated the Timberwolves 132-130 in overtime. Source [2] and [3] also show the final score as 132-130 in favor of the Pacers. Additionally, source [7] provides a detailed account of the game, including Obi Toppin's game-winning three-pointer in overtime. \n\nAll the sources agree that the Pacers won. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event occurred and the Pacers won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in question is the same as the one in the sources. The date, teams, and outcome all match. No conflicting information is present. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Indiana Pacers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 132-130 in overtime on March 17, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][3][7]. The game occurred on schedule with no indications of postponement or cancellation. According to the resolution conditions, this outcome triggers a **p2** resolution (Pacers win).\n\nrecommendation: p2",

It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all agree that the Pacers won. This is in line with the instructions to use verified facts and concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and verifies the outcome through multiple sources. It then aligns this outcome with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt, concluding that the market should resolve to p2 (Pacers win). This reasoning is thorough and follows the prompt's requirements.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response ensures that the details of the event (date, teams, and outcome) match the information provided in the user prompt and the sources cited. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is directly based on the verified outcome of the Pacers winning the game.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and aligns with the user prompt's conditions without introducing any irrelevant information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it accurately resolves the query based on the verified outcome of the event, adheres strictly to the instructions, and logically processes the information to arrive at the correct resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Pacers vs. Timberwolves game and correctly aligns this with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome and adheres closely to the system prompt instructions, ensuring a reliable and accurate resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907943 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:05:43 UTC",
