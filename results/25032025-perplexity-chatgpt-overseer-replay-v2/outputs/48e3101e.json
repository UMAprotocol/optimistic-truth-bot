The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Panthers vs. Capitals game scheduled for March 22, 2025, at 5:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Panthers win, it's p2; if the Capitals win, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was supposed to happen on March 22, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify if the game occurred and its result. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [4], [5], [8]) report that the Washington Capitals defeated the Florida Panthers 6-3 on March 22, 2025. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game taking place as scheduled. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that a Capitals win resolves to p1. Since the Capitals won, the correct resolution should be p1. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable here. All sources confirm the result, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Capitals defeated the Florida Panthers 6-3 in their NHL game on March 22, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][4][5][8]. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with the Capitals securing a decisive victory highlighted by goals from Tom Wilson, Connor McMichael, and others[1][4]. Since the Capitals won, the market resolves to **p1** per the ancillary data specifying a Washington win as the resolution condition. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This is in line with the requirement to use verified facts.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness:\n   - The response logically follows the conditions set in the ancillary data where a win by the Capitals corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n   - It correctly dismisses the possibilities of postponement or cancellation since the game occurred as scheduled.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using multiple sources, which is crucial for the accuracy of the oracle.\n   - The recommendation of p1 aligns perfectly with the verified outcome and the predefined resolution conditions.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:\n   - There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the user prompt's conditions without introducing any irrelevant information.\n\nBased on this analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
