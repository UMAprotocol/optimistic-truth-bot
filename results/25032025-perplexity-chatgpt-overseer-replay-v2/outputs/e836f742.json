The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Fordham vs. Rhode Island college basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 2:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Fordham wins, the market resolves to \"Fordham\" (p2), and if Rhode Island wins, it resolves to \"Rhode Island\" (p1). If the game is postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 12, so the event should have already taken place. Now, looking through the search results, several sources confirm the game happened. For example, source [5] from CBS Sports and [9] from ESPN both report that Fordham won the game 88-71 in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament on March 12. Additionally, source [13] on Action Network also lists the final score as Fordham 88, Rhode Island 71. \n\nI need to verify that this is the same game referenced in the query. The date, teams, and context (Atlantic 10 Tournament) all match the user's query. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports indicate the game was played as scheduled. \n\nSince Fordham won the game, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to \"Fordham,\" which corresponds to p2. There's no ambiguity here because multiple credible sources confirm the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Fordham Rams defeated the Rhode Island Rams 88-71 in the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament game played on March 12, 2025, at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C. This outcome was verified through multiple credible sources, including ESPN[9], CBS Sports[5], and Action Network[13], which all reported the final score and game details. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation.  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- Fordham's Jackie Johnson III led scoring with 29 points, supported by Japhet Medor (26 points) and Romad Dean (14 points)[5][9].  \n- Rhode Island's top performers included Jaden House (19 points) and David Fuchs (14 points)[9].  \n- Fordham controlled the game from the start, leading 49-37 at halftime and maintaining their advantage through the second half[9].  \n\nSince Fordham won decisively, the market resolves to **\"Fordham\"** per the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931890 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:44:50 UTC"
