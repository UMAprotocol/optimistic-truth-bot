The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Montana vs. Wisconsin NCAA basketball game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 1:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Wisconsin wins, it's p1; if Montana wins, p2; if postponed, the market stays open until completion; and if canceled, it resolves 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 20, so the game should have already taken place. Looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]) report that Wisconsin defeated Montana 85-66 on March 20. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game happening on the scheduled date. \n\nThe results detail the game's outcome, with Wisconsin as the clear winner. There's no mention of the game being rescheduled or canceled. Since the game was completed, the cancellation clause doesn't apply. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Wisconsin). \n\nI need to ensure that all sources confirm the game's completion and Wisconsin's victory. All provided links from reputable sports news outlets and the Big Sky Conference's official site confirm the result. No conflicting information suggests a postponement or cancellation. Thus, the resolution is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Wisconsin and Montana occurred as scheduled on March 20, 2025, at 1:30 PM ET. Third-seeded Wisconsin defeated 14th-seeded Montana 85-66[1][2][5][6], with the Badgers dominating through superior shooting (55.4% FG vs. Montana's 39.7%)[1][3] and rebounding (40-29 advantage)[1]. Key contributors included John Blackwell (19 points)[1][5] and Steven Crowl (18 points)[6][7], while Montana's top scorers were Kai Johnson and Te'Jon Sawyer (15 points each)[2][4].\n\nThe game was completed without postponement or cancellation[1][4][5], meeting all specified resolution conditions. Since Wisconsin won decisively, the market resolves to **p1** under the defined terms.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908953 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:22:33 UTC"
