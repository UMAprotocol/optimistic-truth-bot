The ancillary data specifies that if the Rockets win, it's p1; Suns win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 12, 2025. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results:\n\nSearch result [2] from YouTube clearly states that the Houston Rockets defeated the Phoenix Suns 111-104 on March 12, 2025. The detailed game flow summary and final score in [2] confirm the Rockets' victory. Additionally, search result [5] (thescore.com) and [7] (Fox Sports) both list the final score as Rockets 111, Suns 104. These sources are reliable and consistent.\n\nThere's also mention of a prediction from February 13, 2025 (search result [3]) giving the Rockets a 76% chance, but that's a prediction before the game. The actual result is confirmed by multiple post-game sources. \n\nNo information suggests the game was postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game as having taken place. Therefore, the Rockets won, so the resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Houston Rockets defeated the Phoenix Suns 111-104 in their NBA game on March 12, 2025, at the Toyota Center[2][5][7]. Key factors included Houston's 21 points off Phoenix's 17 turnovers and clutch shooting from Jalen Green (29 points) and Dillon Brooks (18 points)[2][5]. The Rockets maintained control despite Phoenix shooting 53.4% from the field, with critical defensive plays and a 12-8 advantage in three-pointers made[2][7]. The game included ejections of centers Steven Adams and Mason Plumlee following a second-quarter altercation[2][5].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the query based on the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Phoenix Suns vs. Houston Rockets game) occurred on March 12, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, which places the event in the past. The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event using reliable sources such as YouTube, thescore.com, and Fox Sports, all of which confirm the Rockets' victory. This adheres to the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with the verification of the event date, followed by the confirmation of the event's outcome through multiple sources. It also correctly ignores the pre-game prediction since it is irrelevant to the resolution of an event that has already occurred. The response includes details of the game, such as key players' performances and specific incidents during the game, which supports the credibility of the sources and the factual accuracy of the event's outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. Since the Rockets won, the market should resolve to \"p1,\" which is exactly what the AI recommends. The sources cited are appropriate and relevant, providing a strong basis for the resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI has focused solely on the relevant details required to resolve the query and has not included unnecessary or unrelated information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation is based on concrete evidence and established facts, and it directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the event's verified outcome, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the event's outcome and provides a detailed, factual summary of the game, which supports the resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
