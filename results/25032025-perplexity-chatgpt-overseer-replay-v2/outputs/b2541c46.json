The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the North Carolina vs. Wake Forest college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 2:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if North Carolina wins, the market resolves to \"North Carolina\" (p2), if Wake Forest wins, it's \"Wake Forest\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the event date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources ([1], [7], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14]) report that the game took place. For example, source [1] mentions the game on March 13, 2025, and that North Carolina won 68-59. Similarly, source [10] from the ACC confirms the same score and outcome. \n\nNext, I need to verify the result. Multiple sources consistently state that North Carolina (UNC) defeated Wake Forest with a score of 68-59. RJ Davis was a key player for UNC, scoring 23 points. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources refer to it happening on the scheduled date. There's no mention of the game being incomplete or rescheduled. \n\nSince the game was played and North Carolina won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (North Carolina). There's no ambiguity here because all sources agree on the outcome, and the event date is in the past with confirmed results. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe March 13, 2025, ACC Tournament quarterfinal basketball game between North Carolina and Wake Forest occurred as scheduled, with **North Carolina defeating Wake Forest 68-59**[1][7][10][13]. This outcome was confirmed by multiple authoritative sources including CBS Sports, the ACC's official website, ESPN, and both universities' athletic departments. \n\nKey details:\n- **RJ Davis** led UNC with 23 points and five 3-pointers[10][13]\n- **Ven-Allen Lubin** added a double-double (10 points, 13 rebounds)[10]\n- Wake Forest's **Hunter Sallis** scored a game-high 25 points in the loss[9][14]\n- The game featured 12 lead changes before UNC secured victory with a late 12-2 run[12][14]\n\nNo evidence suggests postponement or cancellation - the game concluded normally under standard conditions. Based on the resolution parameters, this market should resolve to **North Carolina (p2)** as the decisive winner.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934965 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:36:05 UTC"
