The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chicago Bulls vs. Utah Jazz game scheduled for March 17, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Bulls win, it resolves to \"Bulls\" (p2), if the Jazz win, to \"Jazz\" (p1), and if canceled, 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9) report that the Bulls won 111-97 on March 17. The Jazz were on a 10-game losing streak, and the game wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of postponement. Search result 4 talks about rescheduled games, but the Bulls-Jazz game on March 17 isn't listed there. All other sources confirm the game happened as planned. No indication of cancellation either. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: Bulls win means p2. Since the Bulls won decisively, the market should resolve to p2. No conflicting information found. All sources agree on the outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe Chicago Bulls defeated the Utah Jazz 111-97 on March 17, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][5][7][8][9]. The game occurred as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with the Bulls securing a decisive victory highlighted by Coby White's 26-point performance and balanced scoring from six players in double figures. The Jazz extended their losing streak to 10 games, last winning on February 28, 2025[1][7]. \n\n**Resolution Analysis**  \n- **Game Outcome**: Completed as scheduled with a Bulls victory  \n- **Postponement/Cancellation**: No evidence of either (sources confirm the game proceeded)[1][4][5]  \n- **Ancillary Data Alignment**: Bulls win corresponds to resolution **p2**  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns with the ancillary data provided, and offers a clear recommendation based on established facts.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Chicago Bulls vs. Utah Jazz game occurred on March 17, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. It confirms the Bulls' victory with a score of 111-97, which matches the resolution condition for a Bulls win (p2). The response uses multiple sources to verify these facts, ensuring reliability.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and outcome of the game, checking for any postponements or cancellations, and then aligning the outcome with the specified resolution conditions. It provides a detailed account of the game's highlights, which supports the conclusion and adds depth to the analysis.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks for any deviations such as postponements or cancellations. It aligns the recommendation (p2) directly with the ancillary data provided, where a Bulls win corresponds to p2.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, biases, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and avoids any speculative or irrelevant information.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, alignment with the user prompt's conditions, and logical reasoning throughout the response, the recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Bulls win) is justified and well-supported.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome, aligns with the ancillary data, and logically processes the information to provide a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event details and outcome, adheres strictly to the resolution conditions, and provides a clear and accurate recommendation based on verified facts.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907858 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:04:18 UTC"
