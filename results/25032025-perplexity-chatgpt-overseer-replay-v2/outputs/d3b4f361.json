        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Purdue vs. High Point game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 12:40 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: Purdue win is p1, High Point is p2, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The current date given is March 26, 2025, which is after March 20, so the game should have already happened. Let me look through the search results to find the actual outcome. \n\nLooking at the sources, result [4] from SI.com has the headline \"Purdue Dominates on the Boards, Beats High Point 75-63 in NCAA Tournament Opener.\" That's a clear indication that Purdue won. The article details the game, mentioning the final score of 75-63 in favor of Purdue. Other sources like [1], [2], [3], [6], [7], and [8] are predictions or pre-game analyses, but [4] is a post-game report confirming the result. \n\nI should verify that there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game taking place as scheduled. The ancillary data specifies that if the game is postponed, the market remains open, and if canceled, resolves to 50-50. Since the game was played and Purdue won, the resolution should be p1. \n\nNo conflicting information in the search results suggests any other outcome. All post-game reports confirm Purdue's victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nPurdue defeated High Point 75-63 in their NCAA Tournament first-round game on March 20, 2025, as confirmed by post-game reports[4]. The Boilermakers secured the victory with strong rebounding and defense, advancing to the second round. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions where a Purdue win corresponds to **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that the event (Purdue vs. High Point game) occurred on March 20, 2025, and that the current date is March 26, 2025, which is after the event date. This confirms that the event is not in the future, and thus, the response should not default to p4.\n\nThe response also correctly identifies the outcome of the event from a reliable source (SI.com), stating that Purdue won the game with a score of 75-63. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt where a Purdue win corresponds to p1. The response checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled and finds none, further supporting the resolution to p1.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks the date of the event, confirms the event has occurred, verifies the outcome from a credible post-game report, and ensures no conflicting information about postponement or cancellation. The response also aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not rely on predictions or pre-game analyses but uses a post-game report to confirm the outcome, which is a critical requirement for resolving the query accurately.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985946 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:45:46 UTC",
