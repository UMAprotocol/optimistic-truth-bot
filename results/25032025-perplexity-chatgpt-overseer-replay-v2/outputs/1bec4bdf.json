The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p2; if the Blackhawks win, p1; if postponed, stay open; if canceled, resolve to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 20, 2025. Results [2], [3], [5], [6], [7] all confirm the game was played, with the Kings winning 3-1. So there's no postponement or cancellation here. \n\nNext, verifying the outcome. Multiple sources report the Kings won 3-1. For example, result [5] states the final score was 3-1 Kings, and [6] from NHL.com also confirms the Kings' victory. The Blackhawks lost, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Kings). \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all sources align on the result. No mentions of the game being canceled or postponed. Therefore, the resolution is straightforward: Kings win, so p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 in their NHL game on March 20, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[2][3][5][6][7]. The game was played as scheduled without postponement or cancellation. According to the resolution conditions, a Kings victory corresponds to **p2**.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742986409 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:53:29 UTC"
