The user wants to know if the Washington Wizards will make the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs, with the market resolving to \"No\" if they're mathematically eliminated. The key here is to check if the Wizards have already been eliminated from playoff contention based on the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results to find any mentions of the Wizards' playoff status. Result [2] from March 20, 2025, states that the Orlando Magic defeated the Wizards, eliminating them from playoff contention. The Wizards' record at that time was 15-54. Result [6], dated March 22, 2025, confirms that the Wizards were officially eliminated after that loss. Additionally, result [5] shows their record as 15-52, and result [8] lists their season record as 15-55, both indicating a very poor standing. \n\nResult [9] from March 23, 2025, explicitly mentions that the Wizards became the first Eastern Conference team to be mathematically eliminated. This is further supported by result [11], which states the Wizards have missed the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year. The NBA's official scenarios and elimination notices in results [6] and [10] also back this up. \n\nSince the resolution condition states that reaching the Play-In Tournament doesn't count, and the Wizards are already eliminated from even the Play-In, the answer should be \"No\". All sources agree they can't make the playoffs, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Wizards have been mathematically eliminated from contention for the 2024-25 NBA Playoffs. This elimination occurred on March 20, 2025, following their 120-105 loss to the Orlando Magic, which left them with a 15-54 record and cemented their position at the bottom of the Eastern Conference[2][6][9]. As of March 25, 2025, their record stands at 15-55, ranking 15th in the Eastern Conference and 5th in the Southeast Division[5][8].  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- The Wizards were the first Eastern Conference team eliminated from playoff contention[9].  \n- They trail the final play-in tournament spot by 13.5 games, making it impossible to qualify even for the play-in stage[3][6].  \n- Official NBA playoff rules require teams to secure one of the top 16 postseason bracket spots, which the Wizards cannot achieve[6][11].  \n\nThis outcome marks the fourth consecutive season the Wizards have missed the playoffs[11].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
