        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Donald Trump signed an executive order between March 10 and March 14, 2025, that addresses cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology. The resolution depends on checking the Federal Register for any such orders in that timeframe.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided search results to find any executive orders signed by Trump during those dates. The search results mention several executive orders related to crypto. The main ones are from January 23, 2025, and March 6, 2025. \n\nThe January 23 order is about supporting digital assets and blockchain, but that's outside the March 10-14 window. Then there's the March 6 order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. However, March 6 is before March 10, so it doesn't fall within the specified dates. \n\nLooking further, there's a mention of a March 14 press release from Congressman Donalds about cementing Trump's executive order into legislation, but that's about legislation, not an executive order. Another result from March 6 (source 9) discusses the establishment of the reserve and stockpile, but again, March 6 is outside the target period. \n\nNo other executive orders are mentioned in the search results within March 10-14. The latest relevant order is on March 6. Since the user specified the period as March 10-14 and there's no evidence of an executive order in that window, the answer should resolve to \"No\". \n\nAdditionally, the Federal Register is the resolution source, and if no order was published there during those dates, the market resolves to \"No\". Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did not sign any executive orders related to cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology between March 10 and March 14, 2025. The key crypto-related executive orders from this period include:\n\n1. **January 23, 2025**: Trump signed the foundational order *\"Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology\"*, which revoked Biden-era policies and established a pro-crypto framework[1][2][3][6][7][17].  \n2. **March 6, 2025**: Trump issued an executive order creating the **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** and **U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile**, centralizing seized crypto holdings[9][10][11][12][13][15].  \n\nNo executive orders matching the criteria were published in the Federal Register during the March 10\u201314 window. The March 6 order falls outside the specified dates, and subsequent actions (e.g., Rep. Donalds\u2019 March 14 legislation proposal) are unrelated to new executive orders[8][12].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908028 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:07:08 UTC",
