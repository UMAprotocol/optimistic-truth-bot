        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market resolves to \"Yes\" because SpaceX rescued the stranded astronauts before April 2025. The key here is determining if Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore departed the ISS by March 31, 2025, using a SpaceX vehicle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for their departure date. Looking at the sources, multiple articles mention they undocked on March 18, 2025. For example, source [1] states they left the ISS on March 18, and source [10] confirms the splashdown on March 18. The SpaceX Crew Dragon was used, which is owned by SpaceX. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that departure is when they undock and begin the return journey. The undocking happened on March 18, well before the March 31 deadline. All the sources, including NASA's official blog [10], confirm this. There's no conflicting information about the date or the vehicle used. \n\nSince all conditions are met\u2014departure by the deadline using a SpaceX spacecraft\u2014the resolution should be \"Yes\". No ambiguity here; the sources are consistent and credible.\n</think>\n\nNASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore departed the International Space Station (ISS) aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft on **March 18, 2025**, undocking at 1:05 a.m. EDT[1][4][10][12]. Their return journey concluded with a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico at 5:57 p.m. EDT the same day[10][12][14]. This marked the end of their 286-day stay, which began as a 10-day Boeing Starliner test flight in June 2024 but was extended due to technical issues with the Starliner[1][8][13].\n\nThe Crew Dragon mission (Crew-9) was explicitly a SpaceX-operated rescue effort, expedited after delays and political pressure[7][12]. The astronauts' departure and return via SpaceX's vehicle occurred well before the March 31, 2025, deadline specified in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The AI confirms that the astronauts departed on March 18, 2025, using a SpaceX Crew Dragon, which meets the conditions set forth in the ancillary data for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe response is logically sound, providing specific dates and details about the departure and return of the astronauts, including the spacecraft used and the timeline of events. The AI cites multiple sources, which it claims confirm the departure and splashdown dates, the vehicle used, and the nature of the mission. This thorough sourcing and specific mention of the vehicle and dates align well with the requirements to verify the event as specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe recommendation of p2 (\"Yes\") is directly aligned with the definitions provided in the ancillary data, as the astronauts did indeed depart before the deadline using a SpaceX vehicle. The AI's response is clear and directly addresses the query without ambiguity.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing direct quotes or more detailed citations from the sources to enhance the credibility and traceability of the information provided. While the response mentions multiple sources, direct excerpts or more specific details about these sources (like publication names or URLs, if applicable) would strengthen the verification process.\n\nOverall, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it stands, but minor enhancements in source transparency could be beneficial.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately addresses the user prompt with detailed information and sources confirming the event, aligning well with the ancillary data for a 'Yes' resolution.\",\n  \"critique\": \"While the response is thorough, including more specific details or direct quotes from the sources could enhance the credibility and traceability of the provided information.\"\n}\n```",
