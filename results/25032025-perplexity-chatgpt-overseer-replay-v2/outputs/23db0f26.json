        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will issue an executive order on March 23, 2025, and the market resolves based on whether such an order is published on the White House site or through the press pool by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any executive orders signed on March 23. Let me go through each source. \n\nLooking at source [1], the Littler Mendelson tracker mentions several executive orders from January 24 and March 20, 2025. The March 20 ones include orders on mineral production and others. No mention of March 23 here.\n\nSource [2] lists executive orders signed in 2025 up to March 14 and 20. The latest mentioned are EO 14238 on March 14, published March 20. No entries for March 23.\n\nSource [5] discusses an executive order from March 20, 2025, rescinding previous orders. Again, March 23 isn't mentioned.\n\nSource [7] and [15] both reference an executive order on mineral production signed on March 20. Source [9] and [13] talk about an Education Department order signed on March 20 or 21. Source [12] includes orders up to January 24. \n\nThe White House page (source [5]) has an order from March 20. The Federal Register (source [2]) shows the latest published orders as of March 20. No sources mention an executive order on March 23. \n\nSince the resolution requires the order to be published by 12 PM ET the next day (March 24), and there's no evidence of any such publication, the answer should be \"No\". The ancillary data specifies p2 as Yes and p1 as No. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results, there is no evidence that President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 23, 2025. The latest executive orders documented in the sources were issued on **March 20 and 21, 2025**, including:\n\n- **March 20, 2025**:  \n  - An order to accelerate domestic mineral production[7][15].  \n  - Additional rescissions of prior executive actions[5].  \n\n- **March 21, 2025**:  \n  - An executive order initiating the dismantling of the Department of Education[9][13].  \n\nThe Federal Register and White House presidential actions page (as of March 25, 2025) do not list any executive orders published for March 23, 2025[1][2][5]. Per the market\u2019s resolution conditions, since no executive order was published by 12:00 PM ET on March 24, 2025, the market resolves to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It correctly identifies that the event (issuing of an executive order by Donald Trump on March 23, 2025) is a future event relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). The response uses the specified URLs (White House page and Federal Register) to verify whether the executive order was issued and published, which aligns with the user prompt requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by checking relevant sources for the issuance of an executive order on the specified date. It confirms that no executive order was issued on March 23, 2025, by checking the updates up to March 20 and 21, 2025, and finds no record for March 23. This reasoning is complete as it covers the required timeframe and sources specified in the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that no executive order was published on the specified date by checking the designated sources. It aligns the recommendation (p1, corresponding to \"No\") with the facts gathered from the sources, which is consistent with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI has not missed any critical information based on the details provided in the prompt and has adhered strictly to the sources specified for verification.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data and the facts verified through the designated sources.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the instructions, uses the correct sources for verification, and logically concludes based on the evidence from the specified sources.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925924 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:05:24 UTC",
