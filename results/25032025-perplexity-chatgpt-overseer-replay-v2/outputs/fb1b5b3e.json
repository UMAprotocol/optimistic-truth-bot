        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) purchased Bitcoin between March 11 and March 17, 2025. The resolution depends on an official announcement from the company or Michael Saylor during that period.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any purchases within that timeframe. Looking at the sources, several mention acquisitions around March 2025. For example, result [1] states that on March 23, 2025, MicroStrategy acquired 6,911 BTC. However, March 23 is outside the specified window of March 11-17. \n\nResult [4] mentions a purchase between March 17-23, 2025, which overlaps with the end date of the query's period. March 17 is included in the user's timeframe. The acquisition of 6,911 BTC started on March 17, according to [4], [5], [9], [12], [15], [18], [19], and [20]. \n\nWait, the user's end time is March 17 at 11:59 PM ET. If the purchase started on March 17 and continued through March 23, but the announcement was made on March 24, as per [1], [4], [5], [9], [12], [15], [18], [19], [20], then the actual acquisition period includes March 17. However, the official announcement was on March 24, which is after the resolution period. \n\nThe resolution conditions require the announcement to be made between March 11 and March 17. Even if the purchase occurred on March 17, if the announcement was after March 17, it doesn't count. The sources indicate the announcement was on March 24, so the answer should be \"No\" (p1). But wait, some sources like [12] mention the purchase dates as March 17-23, but the announcement is on March 24. Since the resolution depends on the announcement date, not the purchase date, and the announcement was outside the window, the answer is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nMicroStrategy (now Strategy) did not announce any Bitcoin acquisitions between March 11 and March 17, 2025, based on official sources. While the company purchased 6,911 BTC from **March 17 to March 23**, the announcement of this acquisition occurred on **March 24, 2025**, as confirmed by regulatory filings[1][4][5][9][12][15][18][19][20]. The resolution criteria explicitly require the announcement to fall within the March 11\u201317 window, which was not met.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of the event, and alignment of the recommendation with the facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the resolution of the query depends on whether MicroStrategy announced the acquisition of Bitcoin within the specified timeframe of March 11 to March 17, 2025. The response correctly notes that the announcement date (March 24) is outside the specified window, even though the purchase began on March 17. This adherence to the specific requirement of the announcement date being within the specified window is crucial and has been handled correctly.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by distinguishing between the purchase date and the announcement date. It correctly concludes that since the announcement occurred after the specified period, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). The response is complete in that it considers all necessary information to arrive at a conclusion based on the user prompt's requirements.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event (announcement of Bitcoin purchase) occurred on March 24, which is outside the resolution window. This verification aligns with the user prompt's requirement that the announcement must be made between March 11 and March 17. The recommendation of p1 (No) is therefore aligned with the verified facts and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response effectively uses the information available to make a reasoned judgment based on the user prompt's specific conditions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and proper alignment with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The decision to recommend p1 (No) is supported by the facts as verified and is in strict adherence to the conditions outlined.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the relevant dates and correctly applies the resolution conditions to conclude that the announcement was made outside the specified window, leading to a correct recommendation of p1.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively distinguishes between the purchase and announcement dates, adheres strictly to the user prompt's conditions, and provides a well-reasoned and factually supported recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906422 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:40:22 UTC"
