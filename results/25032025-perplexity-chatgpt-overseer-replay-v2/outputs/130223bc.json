        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Putin\" three or more times during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025. The resolution depends on the video of the event, and the ancillary data specifies that any usage of \"Putin\" (including plural or possessive forms) counts, but other forms don't. The meeting was in the Oval Office, and only the meeting itself counts, not preceding speeches.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The user included several sources, some of which mention the March 13 meeting. Let's look through them. \n\nSearch result [11] is the official White House transcript of the meeting between Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The transcript includes their remarks. Let's scan through the transcript for mentions of \"Putin.\" \n\nIn the transcript, Trump says: \"Obviously, we\u2019ll be discussing what\u2019s happening with respect to Ukraine and Russia.\" He mentions Russia but not Putin here. Later, he says, \"Steve Witkoff and others. And they\u2019re in very serious discussions.\" Witkoff was meeting with Putin, but Trump doesn't mention Putin by name here. \n\nWhen asked by a reporter, \"Vladimir Putin just said he is open to a ceasefire... Do you have plans to speak to him soon?\" Trump responds, \"I would. Yeah, sure.\" Then the reporter asks again, and Trump says, \"He did say that today. It was a very promising statement...\" Here, Trump refers to Putin as \"he\" but doesn't say \"Putin\" again. \n\nLooking through the entire transcript, Trump mentions \"Russia\" several times but only directly says \"Putin\" once in response to the reporter's question. \n\nOther search results, like [3], [5], [10], and [14], discuss the meeting and mention that Trump and Rutte talked about Putin, but these are secondary sources. The resolution must be based on the primary source\u2014the video/transcript of the meeting itself. \n\nSince the transcript shows Trump only said \"Putin\" once, the count is below three. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, I need to confirm there are no other instances in the transcript. Let me check again. \n\nIn the transcript, the only explicit mention is when the reporter brings up Putin, and Trump responds, referring to him as \"he\" but not by name again. So only one instance. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \"No,\" and the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nBased on the official White House transcript of the March 13, 2025 meeting[11], Donald Trump mentioned \"Putin\" **once** during the event when responding to a reporter's question about Vladimir Putin's ceasefire statement. The transcript shows:\n\n1. **Single direct reference**:  \n   > *Q: \"Vladimir Putin just said he is open to a ceasefire... Do you have plans to speak to him soon?\"*  \n   > **Trump**: *\"I would. Yeah, sure... He did say that today. It was a very promising statement...\"*  \n\nWhile Trump discussed Russia-Ukraine negotiations and referenced Steve Witkoff's diplomatic efforts in Moscow[11][14], he did not use the word \"Putin\" again during the meeting. The transcript confirms no additional instances of the term being spoken by Trump, including plural/possessive forms or compound words.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The term \"Putin\" was used **once**, falling short of the three required instances.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and verification of event alignment with the facts provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions by focusing on the specific event (the meeting on March 13, 2025, between Donald Trump and the NATO Secretary General) and the specific term (\"Putin\") that needed to be counted. The response correctly identifies that only direct mentions of \"Putin\" count towards the resolution, and it uses the official White House transcript as a primary source, which is appropriate and reliable.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically searching the transcript for the term \"Putin\" and correctly identifying that it was mentioned only once. The AI's process of double-checking the transcript to confirm the count enhances the reliability of the response. The response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the conditions set in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and uses the correct source (the official transcript) to determine the outcome. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts as Trump mentioned \"Putin\" only once, which is insufficient to meet the threshold of three mentions required for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The AI strictly adhered to the user prompt's requirements and based its resolution solely on the verified primary source without making assumptions or predictions.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, uses the correct primary source for verification, and logically concludes based on the evidence provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and thorough, ensuring all aspects of the user prompt are addressed and verified with the appropriate source.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923375 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:22:55 UTC",
