The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the NBA game between the Orlando Magic and Cleveland Cavaliers on March 16, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Magic win, the market resolves to \"Magic\" (p2), and if the Cavaliers win, it resolves to \"Cavaliers\" (p1). If postponed, it stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]) report that the Magic won 108-103. The Cavaliers' 16-game winning streak was ended by this loss. \n\nNext, ensure there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. All sources discuss the game as having taken place on March 16, with detailed stats and highlights. No indication of the game being rescheduled or canceled. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: Magic win is p2. Since the Magic did win, the correct resolution is p2. All sources corroborate this, so no ambiguity. Need to make sure the answer cites the relevant sources and follows the formatting rules, ending with the recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe Orlando Magic defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-103 on March 16, 2025, ending the Cavaliers' 16-game winning streak[1][2][3][4][5][7][8]. Multiple sources confirm Paolo Banchero (24 points) and Franz Wagner (22 points) led Orlando's comeback victory after trailing by 13 points in the first half[2][3][4][5]. The game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][6][7].\n\n**Key resolution factors:**\n- Final score: Magic 108, Cavaliers 103[1][5][6]\n- Game occurred on scheduled date (March 16, 2025)[1][6]\n- No evidence of cancellation or postponement[2][3][4][7]\n- Clear winner established through completed gameplay[5][8]\n\nrecommendation: p2",

This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Magic win corresponds to a resolution of \"p2.\"\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response thoroughly checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled and confirms that the game was completed as scheduled. It uses multiple sources to verify the outcome, ensuring the reliability of the information provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. It confirms the event's occurrence, the outcome, and that there were no deviations such as postponements or cancellations that would affect the resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has correctly used the information available to it without overstepping the boundaries set by the prompt, focusing solely on verified facts.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI meets the requirements set forth in the system prompt and accurately resolves the oracle request based on the established facts.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907173 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:52:53 UTC",
