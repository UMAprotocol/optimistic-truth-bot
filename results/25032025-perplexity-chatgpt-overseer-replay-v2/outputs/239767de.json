        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Creighton vs. St. John's basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 6:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Creighton wins, it's p2; St. John's win is p1. If postponed, the market stays open until completion. If canceled, it resolves 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 15, so the event should have taken place. Let me look through the search results to find the game's outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources mentioning the game. Result [1] from gocreighton.com states that Creighton lost to St. John's 82-66 in the BIG EAST Tournament title game on March 15. Similarly, result [5] from redstormsports.com confirms that St. John's won the championship game against Creighton with the same score. Another source [18] from 247sports.com also reports St. John's victory.\n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources indicate it was played on March 15. The resolution conditions don't mention anything about tournament context affecting the outcome, so the straightforward result is that St. John's won. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information about the game being postponed or canceled. Results [16] mention a canceled game in 2020, but that's irrelevant here. All recent sources from 2025 confirm the game was played and St. John's won. Hence, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Creighton vs. St. John's men's basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 6:30 PM ET was played as planned. St. John's defeated Creighton 82-66 in the BIG EAST Tournament Championship Game at Madison Square Garden[1][5][18]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game was required.  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- St. John's shot 71% in the second half and made 14 consecutive field goals during a decisive 32-14 run[1][5].  \n- The Red Storm captured their first conference tournament title since 2000[5].  \n- Official box scores and multiple independent sources confirm the final outcome[1][5][18].  \n\nSince St. John's won the game outright, the market resolves according to the ancillary data's defined conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905401 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:23:21 UTC"
