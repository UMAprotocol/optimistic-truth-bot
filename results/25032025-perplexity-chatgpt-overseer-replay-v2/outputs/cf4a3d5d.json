        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said the word \"Recession\" during his March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on whether he used that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The sources provided include transcripts and articles from that event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the transcripts and search results for any mention of \"recession\" by Powell. Looking at the search results, source [4] is a YouTube video titled \"Powell on the possibility of a recession\" with a transcript snippet where Powell mentions a one in four chance of a recession. Source [7] is a transcript from the press conference where Powell discusses recession probabilities, using the exact word multiple times. For example, he says, \"there's always an unconditional possibility of a recession\" and \"the likelihood of a recession was extremely low.\" \n\nAdditionally, source [3] includes a PDF transcript of the press conference where Powell is asked about the Fed's willingness to have a recession to combat inflation. He responds, indicating that the Fed doesn't make such forecasts but acknowledges outside forecasts have raised recession possibilities. Source [6] also mentions Powell's blunt response to recession talk, though the exact wording isn't in the snippet. \n\nThe key here is whether \"recession\" was uttered. From the transcripts in [3], [4], and [7], it's clear Powell used the word multiple times during the Q&A. The resolution conditions state that any usage counts, regardless of context. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nJerome Powell used the word \"recession\" multiple times during the March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference. In response to questions about economic risks, he stated:  \n- \"There's always an unconditional possibility of a recession\" [4][7]  \n- Discussed how \"the likelihood of a recession was extremely low\" two months prior but noted \"forecasters have generally raised their possibility of a recession somewhat\" [4][7]  \n- Referenced traditional recession probabilities being \"broadly in the range of one in four at any time\" [4][7]  \n\nThe transcripts confirm Powell used both the base term \"recession\" and its plural form \"recessions\" during the Q&A session[3][7]. This meets the resolution criteria requiring any usage of the exact term (including pluralization) during the designated event.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
