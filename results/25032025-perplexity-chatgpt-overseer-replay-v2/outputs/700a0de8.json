The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the UNC Wilmington vs. Texas Tech game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 10:10 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Texas Tech wins, it's p1; if UNC Wilmington wins, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place on March 20. For example, source [1] from ESPN details the game recap with a final score of Texas Tech 82-72 UNC Wilmington. Source [5] from the CAA Sports website also reports the same score and outcome. \n\nNext, verify the result. All sources agree Texas Tech won 82-72. Sources [1], [2], [5], and [8] all mention the victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that a Texas Tech win resolves to p1. Since the game happened and Texas Tech won, the recommendation should be p1. No conflicting information found, so no need to consider p3. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament game between UNC Wilmington and Texas Tech took place as scheduled on March 20, 2025, at 10:10 PM ET. **Texas Tech defeated UNC Wilmington 82-72**[1][2][5][8], securing their advancement to the second round. The Red Raiders set an NCAA Tournament record with 46 three-point attempts, led by Kerwin Walton\u2019s career-high 27 points and eight three-pointers[1][8]. UNC Wilmington briefly took a second-half lead but could not sustain momentum against Texas Tech\u2019s balanced scoring and rebounding[1][5].\n\n**Key details confirming the outcome**:  \n- Final score: Texas Tech 82, UNC Wilmington 72[1][5][8].  \n- The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by multiple verified recaps and box scores[1][2][5][6][8].  \n- Texas Tech\u2019s victory aligns with the resolution condition for **p1** (Texas Tech win).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
