The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p2 (Predators p1, Maple Leafs p2, etc.). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 22) is in the past. That means I need to verify the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [1][2][9][10][11][12] report that the Nashville Predators won the game 5-2. For example, source [1] states, \"Filip Forsberg had two goals and an assist, Luke Evangelista had a goal and two assists, and the Nashville Predators snapped a four-game losing streak with a 5-2 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday night.\" This is corroborated by other sources like [2] and [9], which mention the same score and outcome.\n\nThe game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources discuss the game happening on March 22. There's no mention of the game being rescheduled or canceled in any of the provided results. \n\nSince the Predators won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All the evidence points to a clear Predators victory, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Nashville Predators on March 22, 2025, concluded with a **5-2 victory for the Nashville Predators**[1][2][9][10]. Filip Forsberg (2 goals, 1 assist) and Luke Evangelista (1 goal, 2 assists) led Nashville\u2019s offense, while Juuse Saros made 24 saves[1][2][9]. Toronto initially held a 2-0 lead with goals from John Tavares and Mitch Marner, but defensive breakdowns and Nashville\u2019s second-period surge turned the game[10][12]. \n\nThe Predators\u2019 win snapped their four-game losing streak and marked their first multi-goal performance in five games[1][2]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no unresolved conditions affecting the outcome were reported[1][2][9][12]. \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Maple Leafs vs. Predators game) occurred on March 22, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past event. The response then verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all confirm that the Nashville Predators won the game. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a Predators win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm it is a past event. It then proceeds to verify the outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the information is reliable and consistent. The response also confirms that the game was neither postponed nor canceled, which matches the conditions outlined in the user prompt for resolving the market.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome accurately. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Predators win) is directly aligned with the verified facts and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions set in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the past event and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and checks all conditions related to the event's scheduling and occurrence.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924584 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:43:04 UTC"
