        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Marxist\" during his Kennedy Center event on March 17, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he used the term, considering pluralization or possessive forms, but not other variations. The event was scheduled for 4:00 PM ET, and the resolution source is the video of the speech.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each relevant source. \n\nSearch result [11] from KNKX mentions Trump attending the Kennedy Center board meeting as the new chair on March 17, 2025. It discusses his plans to change programming but doesn't mention him using the term \"Marxist\" during the event. \n\nResult [14] from CBS News also covers the board meeting, noting the logistical details and financial issues, but again, no mention of the term. \n\nResult [6] from WEKU briefly mentions Trump touring the Kennedy Center but focuses on a personal story about cancer, unrelated to the term in question. \n\nResult [5] from YouTube's transcript about Trump meeting the Kennedy Center Board doesn't include the word \"Marxist\" in the provided excerpts. \n\nResult [4] from Truthout discusses a DOJ speech where Trump used \"Marxist\" to describe fired prosecutors, but this was on March 17, 2025, which might be the same day as the Kennedy event. However, the DOJ speech is a different event. The user's query specifically refers to the Kennedy Center meeting, so this might not count unless he also used it there. \n\nResult [10] is a PDF transcript where Trump calls Kamala Harris a \"Marxist,\" but this is from a different interview, not the Kennedy event. \n\nOther results like [3] and [13] mention Trump using \"Marxist\" in other contexts (against Kamala Harris and in a Georgia campaign speech), but again, not during the Kennedy Center meeting. \n\nThe key here is to verify if any of the search results explicitly state that Trump used \"Marxist\" during the Kennedy Center board meeting on March 17. From the provided sources, there's no direct evidence of him using the term at that specific event. The DOJ speech on the same day does include the term, but that's a separate engagement. \n\nSince the resolution conditions require the term to be used during the Kennedy Center event, and the available sources don't indicate that, the answer should resolve to \"No.\" However, I need to check if any updates or additional info were provided. The updates mention that Q&A sessions count, but none of the sources report such an instance. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, Trump did not say \"Marxist\" during the Kennedy Center event on March 17, 2025.\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results, there is no evidence that Donald Trump used the term \"Marxist\" during his March 17, 2025 Kennedy Center board meeting appearance. While Trump has frequently used \"Marxist\" as a political epithet against opponents like Kamala Harris[3][10] and DOJ prosecutors[4], none of the coverage of the Kennedy Center event specifically mentions this term being uttered during the board meeting or related activities that day[6][11][14].\n\nThe Kennedy Center meeting focused on leadership changes, programming critiques, and logistical challenges[11][14], with no references to ideological labels like \"Marxist\" in the available transcripts and reports. Other instances of Trump using \"Marxist\" occurred in different contexts:\n- At a DOJ speech earlier that day[4]\n- In campaign remarks about Harris[3][10]\n- During a Georgia rally[13]\n\nSince the resolution conditions specify the Kennedy Center event (4:00 PM ET on March 17) as the scope, and no sources confirm the term's use there, the market resolves to \"No\". \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that the term must be used specifically during this event for the market to resolve to \"Yes.\" The response also correctly disregards mentions of the term \"Marxist\" at other events or in different contexts, which aligns with the user prompt requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically examining various sources that reported on the event and confirming that none of these sources mentioned Trump using the term \"Marxist\" during the Kennedy Center event. The response also correctly identifies that other mentions of the term on the same day at different events do not count towards the resolution of this market.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and examines the content of the event through multiple sources. It aligns the recommendation with the facts gathered from these sources, all of which indicate that the term \"Marxist\" was not used by Trump during the Kennedy Center event.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks the available sources and bases its recommendation on the evidence (or lack thereof) found in these sources.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It accurately follows the instructions, uses logical reasoning, and aligns the recommendation with the verified facts. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the instructions, uses logical reasoning, and aligns the recommendation with the verified facts. All sources were checked, and none indicated that the term 'Marxist' was used during the specified event.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively analyzed the event based on the provided sources and correctly concluded based on the absence of evidence for the use of the term 'Marxist'.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909343 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:29:03 UTC",
