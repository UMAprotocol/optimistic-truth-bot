        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Disgrace\" or \"Disgraceful\" during his Education Event on March 20, 2025, when he signed an Executive Order. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he used either term, considering pluralization or possessive forms, but not other variations. The event was scheduled for March 20 at 4 PM ET, and the current date is March 26, 2025, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump's statements during that specific event. The key here is to focus on the exact terms \"disgrace\" or \"disgraceful\" used by Trump on that day.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's actions related to the Department of Education around March 2025. For example, result [2] from March 20, 2025, quotes U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and others condemning Trump's move as \"a national disgrace.\" However, this is a statement from Sanders, not Trump himself. Similarly, result [3] from the same date includes a press release from Asian Americans Advancing Justice \u2013 AAJC, which also uses \"disgrace\" in their response, but again, this is not Trump's own words.\n\nResult [7], dated March 17, 2025, includes a quote from lawmakers calling Trump's actions \"a national disgrace,\" but again, this is not Trump speaking. Result [8], from March 20, 2025, mentions the same \"national disgrace\" quote from Sanders and others, but again, these are not Trump's statements.\n\nResult [16], from March 12, 2025, discusses layoffs at the Education Department and quotes critics, but again, not Trump using the specific terms. Other results, like [9] and [14], refer to different events (a 2024 trial and a 2024 press conference) and are not relevant to the March 20, 2025 event.\n\nNone of the search results directly quote Trump using \"disgrace\" or \"disgraceful\" during the Education Event on March 20, 2025. The mentions of \"disgrace\" are from other individuals or organizations reacting to his actions, not from Trump himself during that specific event. Therefore, based on the provided sources, there's no evidence that Trump used the specified terms during the event in question. The market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether Donald Trump used the terms \"disgrace\" or \"disgraceful\" during his March 20, 2025 Education Event, where he signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. The resolution depends on verified usage of these exact terms (including plural/possessive forms) during the event.  \n\nMultiple sources confirm Trump\u2019s actions to abolish the Department of Education on March 20, 2025, with critics like Sen. Bernie Sanders and advocacy groups condemning the move as a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d [2][7][8]. However, **none of the provided sources directly attribute the terms \u201cdisgrace\u201d or \u201cdisgraceful\u201d to Trump himself during the specific event**. For example:  \n- Critics, including lawmakers and unions, repeatedly used \u201cdisgrace\u201d to describe Trump\u2019s actions [2][3][7][8][16].  \n- Trump\u2019s prior public statements (e.g., attacking Lindsey Graham in 2016 or reacting to legal cases in 2024) included the term \u201cdisgrace\u201d [1][9][14], but these occurred outside the March 20, 2025 event.  \n\nSince the resolution explicitly requires Trump\u2019s usage during the Education Event, and no evidence from the provided sources confirms this, the market resolves to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment with the facts provided in the user prompt. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event in question occurred on March 20, 2025, and correctly notes that the current date is March 26, 2025, confirming that the event has already taken place. The response adheres to the instruction to verify whether Donald Trump used the terms \"disgrace\" or \"disgraceful\" during this specific event. It correctly identifies that other mentions of the term by different individuals do not count towards the resolution of this market.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking for the use of the specified terms during the event and by differentiating between statements made by Trump and those made by others. It correctly concludes that since there is no evidence of Trump using the terms \"disgrace\" or \"disgraceful\" during the event, the market should resolve to \"No.\"\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and scrutinizes various sources to check for the use of the specified terms by Trump. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) aligns with the facts that no evidence was found of Trump using the terms during the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the terms specified in the user prompt and correctly ignores irrelevant data.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns with the verified facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the non-usage of the terms 'disgrace' or 'disgraceful' by Trump during the specified event and correctly recommends resolving the market to 'No'.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the instructions, uses logical reasoning, and aligns the recommendation with the verified facts without any apparent errors or bias.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985526 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:38:46 UTC",
