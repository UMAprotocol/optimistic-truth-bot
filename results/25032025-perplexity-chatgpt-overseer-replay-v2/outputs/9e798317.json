        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Order\" during his DOJ speech on March 14, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key here is to look for any mention of Trump using the exact word \"Order\" in his speech. The ancillary data specifies that pluralization or possessive forms count, but other forms don't. Also, compound words where \"Order\" is part of it would count, but I need to be careful about that.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's speech. Let's go through them one by one. \n\nResult [1] mentions Trump's speech title: \"pledging to 'expel...'\" but doesn't include the word \"Order\". The article's body talks about his tough-on-crime agenda but doesn't quote him saying \"Order\".\n\nResult [2] has Trump calling opponents \"scum\" and talking about lawbreakers. The quotes here include \"restore the scales of justice\" and \"expel the rogue actors\", but not \"Order\".\n\nResult [3] from CBS News quotes Trump saying \"restoring fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law\" and mentions his executive order related to a law firm. Wait, \"executive order\" is a compound term here. The term \"Order\" is part of \"executive order\". But according to the resolution conditions, compound words count if \"Order\" is part of it. So \"executive order\" would include \"order\" as a separate word. However, the user's query is about the exact term \"Order\" being said. The resolution conditions state that any usage of the term, regardless of context, counts. So if Trump said \"executive order\", that includes the word \"order\", which would count. \n\nLooking at result [3], it says: \"Mr. Trump's order also instructs agency heads to restrict access...\" So in the article, it's mentioned that he signed an executive order. But does the transcript show him saying \"order\" during the speech?\n\nResult [9] is a transcript of Trump's remarks. In the transcript, he says: \"I signed an executive order banning all government censorship...\" Here, he uses the term \"executive order\", which includes the word \"order\". \n\nResult [10] is another transcript. At 18:00, Trump says: \"I signed an executive order banning all government censorship...\" Again, \"executive order\" is used. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that any usage of the term, including in compound words, counts. Since \"executive order\" contains the word \"order\", and he said that during the speech, this would mean the market should resolve to \"Yes\". \n\nAdditionally, result [11] and [12] are from his inauguration speech, which is a different event, so they're not relevant here. \n\nTherefore, based on the transcripts in results [9] and [10], Trump did say \"order\" as part of \"executive order\" during his DOJ appearance. Even though it's part of a compound term, the conditions allow for that. So the answer should be \"Yes\", corresponding to p2.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did use the word \"Order\" during his March 14, 2025, Department of Justice appearance. In his speech, he explicitly stated: **\"I signed an executive order banning all government censorship\"** while discussing his administration's actions[9][10]. The term \"order\" appears here as part of the compound phrase \"executive order,\" which qualifies under the resolution conditions since compound words containing the specified term count regardless of context. \n\nThe speech transcripts confirm this usage occurred during the event[9][10], meeting the market's criteria for resolution. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that Donald Trump used the word \"Order\" as part of the compound phrase \"executive order\" during his DOJ appearance on March 14, 2025. This is in line with the user prompt's condition that any usage of the term \"Order,\" including in compound words, counts towards the resolution of the market.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the transcripts and sources that mention Trump's use of the term \"executive order.\" It correctly concludes that this usage meets the market's criteria for resolution since \"Order\" is part of the compound word \"executive order,\" which is explicitly allowed by the resolution conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and uses the correct sources (transcripts) to confirm that Trump indeed said \"Order\" as part of \"executive order.\" The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) aligns perfectly with the facts and the stipulations provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question and uses the specified sources to draw its conclusion.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns with the established facts and conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzes the event, adheres to the resolution conditions, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the specified sources to verify the occurrence of the event and the usage of the term 'Order' within the context allowed by the market's resolution conditions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933252 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:07:32 UTC",
