        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the UConn vs. Florida game on March 23, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Florida wins, it's p1; UConn, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, check the current date: March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 23, which is in the past. So the event has already occurred. Need to confirm the result from the search results.\n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles confirm the outcome. Source [1] is the Florida Gators' official site, stating they won 77-75. Source [2] from UConn's site also mentions the 77-75 loss. Source [5] and [8] (AP news) corroborate the Florida victory. Even the YouTube video [6] shows the final moments with Florida winning. \n\nAll sources agree Florida won, so the market should resolve to p1. No mentions of postponement or cancellation. The game happened as scheduled, so no need for p3. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nFlorida defeated UConn 77-75 in their March 23, 2025 NCAA Tournament second-round game, ending the Huskies' bid for a third consecutive national championship[1][2][5][8]. The game featured a dramatic finish with Florida closing on an 8-0 run in the final minutes, led by Walter Clayton Jr.'s game-high 23 points[1][8]. The result was confirmed by multiple authoritative sources including both teams' official athletic sites[1][2], Associated Press coverage[8], and detailed game recaps[5].\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: (1) Florida 77, (8) UConn 75[1][8]\n- Florida advanced to its first Sweet 16 since 2017[1][5]\n- UConn's loss snapped its five-game winning streak against Florida[2]\n- The game concluded as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations mentioned in any reports[1-8]\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response is tasked with resolving a market based on the outcome of the UConn vs. Florida game scheduled for March 23, 2025, and it does so by confirming the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple reliable sources.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp and proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources. It confirms that Florida won the game, aligning with the ancillary data provided (p1 for Florida win). The response does not predict or assume but relies on verified facts from authoritative sources such as the official sites of the teams and reputable news outlets.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with the verification of the date and then moving on to confirm the game's outcome. It provides a detailed account of the game, including the final score and key players, which supports the resolution recommendation. The response also checks for any mentions of postponement or cancellation, which are crucial for resolving the market correctly.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, which is a best practice in ensuring accuracy. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Florida win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. It strictly adheres to the facts and the user prompt's conditions without adding unnecessary assumptions or irrelevant details.\n\nGiven the thorough verification, adherence to the provided conditions, and accurate resolution based on the event's outcome, the response is satisfactory and reliable. There is no need for a rerun or additional verification as the response meets the required standards of accuracy and completeness.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the UConn vs. Florida game using multiple reliable sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, factually accurate, and complete.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
