The ancillary data specifies that if the Warriors win, it's p1; Bucks win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results include several sources mentioning the game occurred. For example, result [15] from Fox6Now and [16] from CBS Sports both report the game took place on March 18, with the Warriors winning 104-93. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nNext, confirm the final score. Multiple sources ([15], [16], [17], [19], [20]) state the Warriors won 104-93. Stephen Curry was rested, but the game wasn't postponed. The outcome is clear: Warriors won. \n\nSince the game was played and the Warriors won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. No issues with postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the result, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Milwaukee Bucks and Golden State Warriors on March 18, 2025, was played as scheduled at Chase Center in San Francisco. The Golden State Warriors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks with a final score of **104-93**[15][16][17][19][20]. Key details:  \n\n- **Outcome**: The Warriors secured the victory despite resting Stephen Curry, with Jimmy Butler leading the team in scoring (24 points) and playmaking (10 assists)[15][17].  \n- **Postponement/Cancellation**: The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by multiple post-game reports and box scores[15][16][20].  \n\nBased on the resolution criteria provided:  \n- A Warriors win corresponds to **p1**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906246 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:37:26 UTC"
