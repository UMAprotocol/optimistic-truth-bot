        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a prediction market for a college basketball game between Cal Poly and UC Irvine (Cal Irvine) scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve based on the game's outcome, postponement, or cancellation.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event should have taken place. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([1], [6], [7], [10], [11], [12]) report that UC Irvine defeated Cal Poly 96-78 in the Big West Championship semifinals on March 14, 2025. These sources are from both universities' athletic websites and reputable sports news outlets, which adds credibility.\n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. The detailed game summaries and post-game press conferences mentioned in the search results indicate the game was played as scheduled. Additionally, the Bovada rules ([3]) mention that games played within 48 hours of the scheduled time are not considered postponed, and there's no indication of any delay or cancellation in the sources.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that if UC Irvine (Cal Irvine) wins, the market resolves to p1. All the sources confirm UC Irvine's victory, so the correct resolution is p1. There's no mention of the game being canceled or requiring a 50-50 split, so p3 isn't applicable here. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nUC Irvine (Cal Irvine) defeated Cal Poly 96-78 in the Big West Championship semifinals on March 14, 2025, as documented in multiple official game recaps and press releases from both universities' athletic departments[1][6][7][10][12]. The game was played as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations reported[3][12]. According to the resolution criteria, since UC Irvine won decisively, the market should resolve to the outcome corresponding to their victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (a basketball game between Cal Poly and UC Irvine) and its scheduled date. It verifies that the event occurred as scheduled by referencing multiple credible sources, which is in line with the requirement to use verified facts. The response also correctly identifies the winning team (UC Irvine) and provides the exact score, which matches the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by first confirming the occurrence of the event, then verifying the outcome, and finally aligning the resolution with the ancillary data provided. It checks for any possible postponements or cancellations and confirms none occurred, which is crucial for accurate resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses multiple sources to verify the event's occurrence and outcome, including both universities' athletic websites and reputable sports news outlets. This thorough verification ensures the reliability of the resolution. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (UC Irvine win) aligns perfectly with the verified outcome and the resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or assumptions.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its strict adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple credible sources, aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions, and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and logically sound, with a clear step-by-step verification process that ensures the accuracy and reliability of the resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923480 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:24:40 UTC"
