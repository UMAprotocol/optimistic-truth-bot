The ancillary data specifies that if Iowa State wins, it resolves to p1, Lipscomb to p2, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on or before the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 21, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]) report the final score as Iowa State 82, Lipscomb 55. For example, source [1] from Lipscomb's own site confirms their season ended with that loss. Source [2] from NBC Right Now and [3] from Iowa State's official site both state Iowa State's decisive win. The AP articles ([4], [5], [6], [7]) also consistently report the 82-55 score in favor of Iowa State. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Since the event occurred and Iowa State won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources align on the outcome, so no discrepancies. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Lipscomb and Iowa State occurred as scheduled on March 21, 2025, at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. **Iowa State defeated Lipscomb 82-55**, with Milan Momcilovic leading the Cyclones with 20 points and Jacob Ognacevic scoring 18 for Lipscomb[1][2][3][4]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and all sources confirm the final score and outcome[5][6][7]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided (p1 for Iowa State win, p2 for Lipscomb win, p3 for cancellation), the market resolves to **p1** as Iowa State secured the victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome is verified through multiple sources, which are consistently cited in the response. The response adheres to the instruction to report only on verified facts and to ensure the event has occurred before making a resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources to conclude that Iowa State won the game. It checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled and finds none, which is in line with the resolution conditions provided (p1 for Iowa State win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the facts and the ancillary data conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is thorough in checking for any discrepancies or conflicting information and confirms the outcome through several sources.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the system prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
