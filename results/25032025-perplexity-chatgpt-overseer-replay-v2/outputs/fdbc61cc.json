The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Su Young You vs. AJ Cunningham fight at UFC Fight Night: Vettori vs. Dolidze 2 on March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if You wins, it's p2; if Cunningham, p1; and if a draw or unresolved by April 15, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the fight's outcome. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSource [1] mentions the main event between Dolidze and Vettori but doesn't mention the You vs. Cunningham fight. \n\nSource [2] is the UFC's official event page. In the main card, under Bantamweight Bout, it lists SuYoung You vs. AJ Cunningham with the result \"Decision - Unanimous\" in favor of SuYoung You. That's a direct confirmation from the UFC's site.\n\nSource [3] provides details about the fight, including betting odds and fighter stats, but the actual result isn't mentioned here. \n\nSource [4] is an article titled \"UFC Vegas 104: Grappling Key As You Su-Young Decisions AJ Cunningham.\" The article describes the fight in detail and states the official result as a unanimous decision win for You. \n\nSource [5] is the Wikipedia page for the event. In the results table, under the preliminary card, it clearly states You Su-young def. AJ Cunningham via unanimous decision (30\u201327, 30\u201327, 30\u201327). \n\nSource [6] from MMA Junkie also reports the result as SuYoung You winning by unanimous decision with all judges scoring 30-27. \n\nSource [7] is a YouTube video prediction, which isn't relevant post-fight. Source [8] lists the fight card but doesn't provide results.\n\nAll credible sources\u2014UFC's official site, Wikipedia, Cageside Press, and MMA Junkie\u2014confirm that Su Young You won the fight by unanimous decision. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. Since the event date is in the past and multiple reliable sources confirm You's victory, the market should resolve to p2 (You). The resolution source specified is ESPN, but the consensus from these credible reports aligns with the outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe bout between Su Young You and AJ Cunningham at UFC Fight Night: Vettori vs. Dolidze 2 on March 15, 2025, concluded with **Su Young You winning via unanimous decision** (30\u201327, 30\u201327, 30\u201327)[4][5][6]. Multiple credible sources, including the UFC\u2019s official results[2], Wikipedia[5], and MMA Junkie[6], confirm You\u2019s victory through dominant grappling control and consistent top pressure across all three rounds. The fight was not postponed, canceled, or declared a draw, and the result was finalized before the April 15, 2025, cutoff.  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to \"You\" (p2) based on verified fight outcomes.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
