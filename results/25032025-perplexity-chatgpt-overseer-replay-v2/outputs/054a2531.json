        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Russia\" during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of that meeting. Looking at the sources, there are a few relevant ones. Source [9] is the official White House transcript of the meeting between Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. In the transcript, Trump mentions \"Russia\" multiple times when discussing the Ukraine conflict and peace talks. For example, he says, \"what's happening with respect to Ukraine and Russia,\" and refers to discussions with Russian representatives. \n\nSource [11] is a news article about the same meeting, confirming that Trump talked about Russia in the context of the ceasefire negotiations. Additionally, source [13] is a YouTube video transcript where Trump is quoted discussing Russia during the meeting. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that any usage of \"Russia\" in the meeting counts, regardless of context. The transcript clearly shows Trump used the word \"Russia\" several times. Since the event occurred as scheduled and the term was used, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). There's no indication the meeting was canceled or that the term wasn't used. All sources corroborate the usage, so p2 is the correct resolution.\n</think>\n\nDuring the March 13, 2025, meeting between President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office, Trump explicitly mentioned \"Russia\" multiple times while discussing the ongoing Ukraine conflict and ceasefire negotiations. For example:\n\n- He stated, **\"we\u2019ll be discussing what\u2019s happening with respect to Ukraine and Russia\"** and referenced U.S. representatives engaged in **\"very serious discussions\"** in Russia[9][11].  \n- He also remarked, **\"if they\u2019re not [agreeing to a ceasefire], it\u2019ll be a very disappointing moment for the world\"** regarding Russia\u2019s response[9].  \n- Video evidence from the meeting further confirms Trump\u2019s direct use of the term \"Russia\" during the event[13].  \n\nThe market\u2019s resolution criteria specify that **any contextual use of \"Russia\" during the meeting qualifies**, including plural/possessive forms. Since the meeting occurred as scheduled and the term was verifiably used, the resolution aligns with **p2 (Yes)**.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. The response effectively verifies the occurrence of the event on March 13, 2025, and confirms that Donald Trump mentioned \"Russia\" during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General, which aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe response is logically sound, providing direct quotes and references to multiple sources that corroborate the use of the term \"Russia\" during the meeting. This includes a White House transcript, a news article, and a video transcript, all of which are appropriate and reliable sources for this type of verification.\n\nThe recommendation of p2 (Yes) is well-supported by the evidence provided, as the conditions for resolution (any usage of the term \"Russia\" during the meeting) were clearly met. The response also correctly identifies that the event was not canceled and that the term was used within the context of the meeting, further supporting the resolution to \"Yes.\"\n\nThere are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The AI has adhered strictly to the user prompt's requirements, focusing solely on the specific event and the use of the term \"Russia\" as outlined.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts and alignment with the resolution conditions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the use of the term 'Russia' during the specified event, aligning with the resolution conditions. Multiple reliable sources were used to confirm the details, supporting the recommendation of p2.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively utilized appropriate sources and provided a clear, factual basis for the resolution recommendation. It adhered closely to the instructions and conditions specified in the user prompt.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928487 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:48:07 UTC",
