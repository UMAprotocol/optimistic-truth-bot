        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding whether the Solana SIMD-0228 proposal was approved. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if approved, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The current date is March 26, 2025, and the voting ended on March 13, 2025, according to the search results.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The voting ended on March 13, which is before the current date of March 26. So the event has occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [7], [9], [10]) state that SIMD-0228 was rejected. For example, source [1] mentions the proposal failed to reach the required 66.67% approval, getting only 61.39% in favor. Source [4] confirms the same percentage and the failure to meet the supermajority. The official Solana governance platform isn't directly cited, but credible reports like SolanaFloor and Cryptonews are used, which align with the resolution conditions.\n\nThe ancillary data defines p1 as \"No\" (proposal rejected) and p2 as \"Yes\" (approved). Since the proposal was rejected, the correct resolution is p1. All sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Solana SIMD-0228 governance proposal, which aimed to reduce inflation through a dynamic staking rewards model, **was rejected** in a historic vote concluding on March 13, 2025. Despite early momentum with 75% support, the proposal failed to achieve the required 66.67% supermajority, ultimately receiving 61.39% approval[1][4][10]. \n\nKey factors in the rejection include:\n- **Small validator mobilization**: Validators with <500k SOL staked voted against the proposal at twice the rate of larger operators, fearing reduced rewards would threaten their financial viability[1][3][9].\n- **Staking economics**: The proposal would have lowered annual staking rewards from 4.7% to ~1% at current staking levels, potentially destabilizing smaller network participants[8][10].\n- **Record participation**: 74% of network stake across 910 validators participated \u2013 the largest governance vote in crypto history[3][9].\n\nWhile rejected, the vote demonstrated unprecedented decentralized participation, with institutional players and small validators equally engaged[1][3]. The outcome preserves Solana's current inflation model but highlights tensions between economic efficiency and network decentralization[7][10].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response is structured to first confirm the event's occurrence and then verify the outcome using multiple sources, which is in line with the system prompt requirements for factual accuracy and verification.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (vote on SIMD-0228) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. It uses multiple sources to confirm that the proposal was not approved, aligning with the ancillary data where p1 corresponds to a \"No\" outcome. The response does not predict or assume but relies on reported data, which is crucial for the oracle's function.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by checking the event date, confirming its occurrence, and then detailing the outcome with supporting evidence from credible sources. It also provides context on why the proposal was rejected, which, while not necessary for the resolution, adds depth to the understanding of the event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's outcome through multiple sources, noting the exact percentages and reasons for the proposal's rejection. This thorough verification supports the recommendation of p1, which is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The AI does not use any unverified or irrelevant sources and sticks to the information pertinent to the resolution of the query.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome and aligns the recommendation correctly with the ancillary data.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and thorough, providing a clear and factual resolution based on the event's outcome as required.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742986214 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:50:14 UTC"
