        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Bruins vs. Golden Knights game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve depending on the game's result, including if it's postponed or canceled.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm whether the game actually took place as scheduled. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([1], [4], [5], [7]) report that the game occurred on March 20, 2025. The detailed recaps mention the Golden Knights defeating the Bruins 5-1, with Pavel Dorofeyev scoring a hat trick. This indicates the game was played and not postponed or canceled.\n\nNext, verifying the outcome: all sources agree the Golden Knights won 5-1. The resolution conditions state that if the Golden Knights win, the market resolves to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in the provided results. The BetMGM House Rules ([3]) and Bookmaker's policies ([6]) discuss postponed games, but since the game was played as scheduled, these rules don't apply here.\n\nAdditionally, the current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so there's no issue with the event being in the future. All evidence points to the game having been completed with a clear result. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Golden Knights).\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Bruins and Vegas Golden Knights game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET was played as planned, with the Golden Knights defeating the Bruins 5-1[1][4][5][7]. Pavel Dorofeyev's hat trick and contributions from teammates like Jack Eichel and Ivan Barbashev secured Vegas' victory[1][5]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, as evidenced by multiple detailed recaps of the event[1][4][5][7]. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, since the Vegas Golden Knights won, the market resolves to **p1**. The game's completion on its scheduled date and location negates any consideration for postponement or cancellation clauses outlined in ancillary data[3][6]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate and complete in its analysis and recommendation based on the user prompt and the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Bruins vs. Golden Knights game took place on March 20, 2025, and that the Golden Knights won the game 5-1. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt, where a win by the Golden Knights should lead to a resolution of p1. The response adheres to the system prompt by confirming the event occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled, thus negating the need for alternative resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks whether the game occurred, confirms the outcome, and verifies that no postponement or cancellation took place. It uses multiple sources to confirm the game's result, which supports the reliability of the information. The reasoning is logical, leading to a clear and justified recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event against multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the facts established through these sources. The game's outcome (Golden Knights win) directly corresponds to the resolution condition (p1 for Golden Knights win).\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response effectively uses the information available and adheres strictly to the user and system prompts.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it accurately resolves the query based on the event's verified outcome and adheres to the specified conditions. There is no need for a rerun or default to p4, as the response meets the required standards of accuracy and completeness.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns with the resolution conditions, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event details and outcome, providing a well-supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930368 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:19:28 UTC",
