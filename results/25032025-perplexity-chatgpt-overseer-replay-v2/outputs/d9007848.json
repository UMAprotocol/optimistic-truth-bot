The ancillary data specifies that if the Celtics win, it's p2 (Celtics), Kings win p1 (Kings), postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game date as March 24, 2025, and multiple sources like [2], [3], and [6] confirm the game took place. So no postponement or cancellation.\n\nNext, determining the winner. Source [2] states the Celtics won 113-95. The box score in [4] and the recap in [6] also confirm the Celtics' victory. The final score from [6] is Celtics 113, Kings 95. Additionally, [1] and [8] are video highlights titled with the Celtics' win. \n\nThere's mention of Jayson Tatum's injury in [2], but the game was completed, and the Celtics maintained their lead. The injury didn't affect the game's outcome. The spread and total bets in [6] also note the Celtics covered the spread, further confirming their win.\n\nNo sources indicate the game was postponed or canceled. All evidence points to the Celtics winning. Therefore, the resolution should be p2 (Celtics).\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Celtics defeated the Sacramento Kings 113-95 in their March 24, 2025 matchup[2][6]. Key details from the game:\n\n- **Celtics dominance**: Boston extended their win streak to six games, shooting 19/50 (38%) from three-point range compared to Sacramento's 8/24 (33.3%)[4][6]. Their bench outscored the Kings' reserves 32-4[1].\n  \n- **Tatum injury**: Jayson Tatum left late in the third quarter after a Flagrant 1 foul by Domantas Sabonis, but had already contributed 25 points, 7 rebounds and 8 assists[2].\n\n- **Sabonis return**: The Kings center returned early from injury with 16 points and 17 rebounds, but Sacramento committed 14 turnovers leading to 14 Celtics points[4][6].\n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation[2][4][6]. As the Celtics won decisively, this market resolves to their victory.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
