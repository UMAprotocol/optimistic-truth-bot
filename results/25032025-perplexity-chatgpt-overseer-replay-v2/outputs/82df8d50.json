The ancillary data specifies that if the Hornets win, it's p2; Spurs win is p1. If postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results all mention the game took place on March 14, 2025. Sources [1], [2], [3], [5], and [7] confirm the game was played, with the Hornets winning 145-134. The date in the query is March 14, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 25, 2025. \n\nNext, verify the outcome. Multiple sources report the Hornets' victory. For example, [1] states the Hornets won 145-134, and [3] has the final score as well. The Spurs' injuries, like De'Aaron Fox's absence, are noted in [1] and [4], but the game wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the event occurred and the Hornets won, the resolution should be p2. No sources mention postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets defeated the San Antonio Spurs 145-134 on March 14, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][3][5][7]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. LaMelo Ball led the Hornets with 27 points and 14 assists, while the team set a franchise record with 26 three-pointers[1][5]. San Antonio played without key players De\u2019Aaron Fox and Victor Wembanyama[1][4], but the game proceeded under standard conditions.  \n\n**Resolution Analysis**  \n- **Event Occurrence**: The game took place on the specified date and time[1][3][7].  \n- **Outcome**: Charlotte secured a decisive victory (145-134)[1][3][7].  \n- **Ancillary Conditions**: No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in the sources[1][2][5].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924448 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:40:48 UTC",
