        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the SMU vs. Clemson CBB game on March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Clemson wins, it's p1; SMU win is p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The search results mention the game was on March 13, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. \n\nLooking at the sources, result [2] from the ACC's official site and [6] from ESPN both confirm the game was played. They report Clemson won 57-54. Specifically, [2] states, \"No. 3 seed Clemson battled back to beat No. 6 seed SMU 57-54 on Thursday, March 13,\" and [6] echoes this with the final score. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Both sources detail the game's events, including key plays and player stats, which confirms it took place. Since the game was completed and Clemson won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. Other sources like [1], [10], and [11] are predictions before the game, but [2] and [6] are post-game recaps. No sources indicate a different outcome or cancellation. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Clemson) as they won the game.\n</think>\n\nClemson defeated SMU 57-54 in the ACC Tournament quarterfinals on March 13, 2025, as verified by multiple post-game reports[2][6]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, with Clemson securing a comeback victory after trailing most of the second half. Chase Hunter led the Tigers with 21 points, and SMU's late 3-point attempt to tie missed at the buzzer[2][6].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (SMU vs. Clemson CBB game on March 13, 2025) and verifies that it occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. The AI used reliable sources (ACC's official site and ESPN) to confirm the outcome of the game, which is Clemson's victory. This aligns with the user prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks whether the game was played, postponed, or canceled and confirms the game's outcome through multiple sources. The response directly addresses all possible outcomes outlined in the ancillary data (win by Clemson, win by SMU, postponement, cancellation) and correctly resolves the market based on Clemson's win.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using post-game recaps from credible sources. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Clemson win) is directly aligned with the facts verified and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI appropriately used the sources to confirm the event's details and outcome without relying on predictions or irrelevant data.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924096 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:34:56 UTC"
