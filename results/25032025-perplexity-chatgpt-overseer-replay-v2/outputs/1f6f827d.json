        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know whether Bodo Glimt or Olympiakos advanced in the UEFA Europa League matchup based on the provided resolution conditions. The ancillary data specifies that p2 corresponds to Bodo Glimt advancing. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The event in question is the Round of 16, which had two legs. The first leg was on March 6, 2025, and the second leg on March 13, 2025. Both dates are in the past relative to the current date, so the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, the first leg (March 6) ended with Bodo/Glimt winning 3-0 at home [7][9][10]. The second leg (March 13) was won by Olympiakos 2-1, but the aggregate score was 4-2 in favor of Bodo/Glimt [1][4][8]. \n\nThe key point here is the aggregate score. Even though Olympiakos won the second leg, the total goals over both legs determine the winner. The search results explicitly mention that Bodo/Glimt advanced 4-2 on aggregate [1][4]. \n\nI need to ensure there's no mention of the match being postponed or canceled, which there isn't. All sources confirm the matches took place as scheduled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Bodo Glimt advanced, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe UEFA Europa League Round of 16 matchup between **Bod\u00f8/Glimt** and **Olympiacos** concluded with **Bod\u00f8/Glimt advancing to the quarter-finals** on a **4-2 aggregate score** [1][4][8]. \n\n- **First Leg (March 6, 2025):** Bod\u00f8/Glimt secured a dominant **3-0 victory** at home, with goals from Kasper H\u00f8gh (2) and an own goal by Olympiacos goalkeeper Konstantinos Tzolakis [7][9][10].  \n- **Second Leg (March 13, 2025):** Olympiacos won the return leg **2-1**, but the result was insufficient to overturn the aggregate deficit. Roman Yaremchuk scored twice for Olympiacos, while Bod\u00f8/Glimt\u2019s Kasper H\u00f8gh added another goal to seal the tie [1][4][11].  \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that **p2 (Bod\u00f8/Glimt)** is the correct outcome for this market, as they progressed to the next round. The matches were played as scheduled, with no cancellations or postponements beyond December 31, 2025.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
