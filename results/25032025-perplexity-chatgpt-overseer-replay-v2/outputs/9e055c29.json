The resolution conditions are specific: p2 is Yes if either term is used, p1 is No if not, and p3 for uncertain cases. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results related to that meeting. The user provided several sources. Let's look through them. \n\nSearch result [2] is the transcript of the meeting between Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. I'll need to scan through that transcript for any mentions of \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\". The transcript includes their conversation, and from a quick read, the discussion revolves around NATO funding, past interactions, and some comments about other countries. There's no mention of cryptocurrency terms here. \n\nSearch result [4] is a CBS News video about the meeting, but the transcript isn't provided. However, the summary mentions Trump's displeasure with NATO but doesn't indicate any crypto-related discussion. \n\nSearch result [6] discusses Trump's territorial goals with Greenland and Canada during the meeting. Again, the focus is on international policy, not cryptocurrency. \n\nSearch result [8] is another CBS News video summary, highlighting Trump's fraught relationship with NATO. No mention of crypto terms here either. \n\nSearch result [13] talks about Trump's statement on Ukraine's NATO membership affecting crypto markets, but that's from February 26, a different event. \n\nOther search results ([1], [3], [5], [7], [9]-[12], [14]-[18]) relate to Trump's crypto policies and other events, but not the March 13 NATO meeting. \n\nSince the key sources about the March 13 meeting ([2], [4], [6], [8]) don't mention \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\", and the user specified that only the meeting itself counts (not preceding speeches or comments), it's safe to conclude that Trump didn't use those terms during the meeting. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have adhered well to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The AI was tasked with determining whether Donald Trump mentioned the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025. The response is based on a thorough review of relevant sources, including transcripts and news summaries, and it correctly identifies that neither term was mentioned during the specified event.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI systematically checks each source related to the event and confirms the absence of the terms \"Crypto\" and \"Bitcoin.\" This methodical approach ensures that the conclusion is based on a comprehensive review of available evidence, which is crucial for accuracy.\n\nThe AI's verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are correctly executed. The response explicitly states that the terms were not mentioned in any of the key sources that cover the meeting. This is in line with the user prompt's requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence from the event itself.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI effectively uses the sources provided to confirm the non-occurrence of the terms during the meeting, and it adheres strictly to the conditions outlined in the user prompt for resolving the market.\n\nGiven these observations, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the query. The recommendation of \"No\" (p1) is well-supported by the evidence, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and comprehensively checks the sources, adheres to the user prompt instructions, and logically concludes based on the evidence provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm that the terms 'Crypto' and 'Bitcoin' were not mentioned during the specified event, aligning well with the resolution conditions and ensuring a reliable resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
