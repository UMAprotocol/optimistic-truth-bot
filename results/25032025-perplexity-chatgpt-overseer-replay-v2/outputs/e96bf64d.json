The ancillary data specifies that if Alabama State wins, it's p2; Texas Southern, p1; postponed stays open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 26, 2025, and the game was scheduled for March 13, so it's already happened. Next, I need to confirm the actual outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([8], [10], [11]) report that Alabama State won the game 84-79. Specifically, the CBS Sports article from March 13, 2025, states that D'Ante Bass led Alabama State to victory. The AP recap and the Alabama State official site both confirm the score and the win. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the 50-50 scenario doesn't apply. All sources agree on Alabama State's win. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2, which corresponds to Alabama State.\n</think>\n\nThe Alabama State Hornets defeated the Texas Southern Tigers 84-79 in the SWAC Tournament quarterfinals on March 13, 2025[8][10][11]. The game occurred as scheduled at 2:00 PM ET in College Park, Georgia, with Alabama State leading 41-29 at halftime and maintaining their advantage through the second half[10]. Key contributors included D'Ante Bass (16 points, 8 rebounds off the bench) and Antonio Madlock (15 points, 8 rebounds)[8][11].\n\n**Resolution Recommendation**  \nSince the game occurred as scheduled and Alabama State won, the market should resolve to \"Alabama State\" per the ancillary data's defined conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Alabama State vs. Texas Southern CBB game) occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple reliable sources, which all confirm that Alabama State won the game. This is in line with the system's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by first establishing the date of the event and confirming it has already occurred. It then verifies the outcome through credible sources and aligns this outcome with the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data. The reasoning is clear, direct, and follows a logical sequence that aligns with the system prompt instructions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, including CBS Sports and the official site of Alabama State. This thorough verification ensures the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Alabama State\" (p2) directly corresponds to the verified outcome and the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question, uses verified sources, and avoids any speculative or irrelevant information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985562 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:39:22 UTC"
