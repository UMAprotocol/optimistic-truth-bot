        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if there's an official ceasefire agreement specifically covering energy infrastructure between Russia and Ukraine by March 31, 2025. The resolution conditions say \"Yes\" (p2) if such an agreement exists, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if it's uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any official announcements from both Russia and Ukraine. Let's look through the sources. \n\nFrom source [1], Zelensky mentioned on March 25 that Ukraine believes the partial ceasefire for the Black Sea and energy infrastructure should start that day. However, Russia's statement on the same day said the Black Sea ceasefire would only take effect after Western sanctions are lifted. So there's a discrepancy here. \n\nLooking at source [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [10], [11], [12], [15], [16], and [17], all these articles from March 26 report that Zelensky stated Ukraine is ready to observe a ceasefire on energy infrastructure following a U.S.-brokered deal. The U.S. mediated talks in Saudi Arabia, and both sides agreed to implement a pause on attacks on energy infrastructure. The White House also mentioned agreements on safe navigation in the Black Sea. \n\nSource [9] from March 20 mentions that after Trump and Putin's call, there was a limited agreement on a 30-day pause in energy infrastructure attacks, but Russia continued strikes. However, more recent sources from March 25-26 indicate that after further negotiations, an agreement was reached. \n\nSource [13] and [14] from March 18 detail the initial agreement between Trump and Putin on a 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire, with Ukraine agreeing under U.S. pressure. However, source [17] from March 25 states that the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine agreed to implement a complete ban on strikes targeting energy infrastructure. The White House confirmed this, and Defense Minister Umerov announced the agreement. \n\nHowever, source [18] mentions that Ukraine accused Russia of violating the ceasefire, with eight confirmed hits on energy facilities since March 18. But the key point here is the existence of an official agreement, not its adherence. The resolution conditions state that the agreement just needs to be officially reached before the deadline, regardless of implementation. \n\nThe U.S. brokered the deal, and both Ukraine and Russia, through their officials, have publicly acknowledged the agreement. Even though there are reports of violations, the market resolves based on the existence of the agreement, not its enforcement. \n\nTherefore, the official agreement was reached by March 25, 2025, as per multiple sources, meeting the March 31 deadline. So the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe available evidence indicates that an official ceasefire agreement specifically covering energy infrastructure between Russia and Ukraine was reached by March 31, 2025. Key developments include:\n\n- **March 18, 2025**: U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to a 30-day halt in attacks on energy infrastructure during a phone call[13][14]. Ukraine initially expressed conditional support pending details from the U.S.[14].\n\n- **March 25, 2025**: Following U.S.-mediated talks in Saudi Arabia, Ukraine's President Zelensky announced that Ukraine had agreed with U.S. negotiators to implement an energy infrastructure ceasefire effective immediately[3][4][5][7][8][10][15][16]. The White House confirmed agreements to:\n  - Implement a pause on energy infrastructure attacks\n  - Ensure safe Black Sea navigation[17][18]\n\n- **Official statements**: Both Ukrainian and Russian delegations participated in the Saudi talks, with the U.S. announcing mutual agreement between the warring parties[17]. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov publicly confirmed the energy infrastructure strike ban[17].\n\nWhile Russia and Ukraine subsequently accused each other of violating the ceasefire[18], the market resolution depends on the **existence of an official agreement** rather than its perfect implementation. Multiple credible sources confirm a publicly announced, mutually agreed halt in energy infrastructure attacks was established through diplomatic channels before March 31.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

It correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on the existence of an official agreement, not its enforcement. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the agreement, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a logical analysis of the events leading to the ceasefire agreement, including negotiations and official statements from involved parties. It addresses potential discrepancies, such as reports of violations, by clarifying that the market resolution depends solely on the existence of the agreement.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event through multiple credible sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts presented. It correctly concludes that an official ceasefire agreement was reached before the deadline, fulfilling the conditions for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or significant biases in the response. The response does not omit crucial information that would affect the resolution recommendation.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis and adherence to the user prompt's requirements, the response is satisfactory and reliable for resolving the query. The recommendation of p2 is well-supported by the evidence provided and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzes the existence of an official ceasefire agreement, using multiple sources to confirm the event, and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough, logically structured, and adheres closely to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It effectively uses credible sources to verify the event and provides a clear, well-supported resolution recommendation.\"\n}\n```",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
