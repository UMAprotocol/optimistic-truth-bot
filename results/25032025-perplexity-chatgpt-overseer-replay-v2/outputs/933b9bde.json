The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Utah Hockey Club game on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, it's p1; if Lightning wins, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 22, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results:\n\nResult [1] from CBS Sports clearly states that Utah won 6-4. It mentions Logan Cooley and Alexander Kerfoot each scoring twice. The date of the article matches the game date, March 22. \n\nResult [2] from NHL.com also confirms the score as Utah 6, Lightning 4. It provides a detailed recap, including goals from both teams and the timeline of the game. \n\nResults [3] and [4] are predictions made before the game, so they aren't relevant for the outcome. The key sources are [1] and [2], both reliable and directly reporting the result. \n\nSince the game happened on the scheduled date and Utah won, the market should resolve to p1 according to the ancillary data. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. The correct recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Utah Hockey Club occurred on March 22, 2025, as scheduled. According to verified game recaps from CBS Sports[1] and NHL.com[2], **Utah Hockey Club defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning with a final score of 6-4**. Key highlights include Logan Cooley and Alexander Kerfoot each scoring two goals for Utah, while Tampa Bay's Brayden Point contributed two goals in the loss. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game was required.  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided (p1 for Utah win, p2 for Lightning win), the market should resolve to **p1** as Utah secured the victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (NHL game between Tampa Bay Lightning and Utah Hockey Club on March 22, 2025) and correctly states that the game has already occurred, which is in line with the system prompt requirement to check the current date and event date. The response uses reliable sources (CBS Sports and NHL.com) to verify the outcome of the game, which Utah won 6-4. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources. It correctly concludes that since Utah won, the market should resolve to p1. The response also correctly disregards predictions and focuses on actual post-game reports, which is a demonstration of logical filtering of relevant information.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using two independent and reliable sources, which both confirm Utah's victory. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Utah win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information and stays focused on the event specified in the user prompt. It does not assume or infer outcomes without evidence, adhering strictly to verified facts.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using reliable sources, logically processes the information, and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event outcome and makes a correct market resolution recommendation based on the user prompt's ancillary data.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926816 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:20:16 UTC",
