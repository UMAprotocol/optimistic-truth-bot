The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the CSU Bakersfield vs. UC Santa Barbara game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if UC Santa Barbara wins, it's p1; if CSU Bakersfield wins, p2; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 26, 2025, so March 12 is definitely in the past. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Result [1] from bigwest.org states that UC Santa Barbara (5th seed) defeated CSU Bakersfield (8th seed) 71-66 in the first round of the Big West Championship on March 12, 2025. They mention advancing to the next round against CSUN.\n- Result [2] from ucsbgauchos.com confirms the same score, 71-66, with details about the game and quotes from the coach.\n- Result [3] from CBS Sports also reports the 71-66 victory for UC Santa Barbara, highlighting Stephan Swenson's performance.\n- Result [4] from NCAA.com's game summary shows the final score as 71-66 in favor of UCSB.\n- Result [7] from thescore.com lists the final score as 71-66 for UCSB and provides key player stats.\n- Results [5] and [6] discuss a different game on February 6, 2025, where UCSB also won, but that's a separate event.\n- Result [8] is a prediction before the March 12 game, which isn't needed since we have actual results.\n\nAll the relevant sources for the March 12 game consistently report UC Santa Barbara's victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (UC Santa Barbara). No conflicting information or future dates here. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nUC Santa Barbara defeated CSU Bakersfield 71-66 in their March 12, 2025, Big West Championship first-round game at Lee's Family Forum[1][2][3][4][7]. The Gauchos maintained a halftime lead of 32-25 and secured the win with key performances from Stephan Swenson (15 points, 6 rebounds, 4 steals) and Kenny Pohto (13 points, 7 rebounds)[3][7]. The game concluded as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the verified sources.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It uses multiple reliable sources to verify the outcome of the game, which is that UC Santa Barbara won. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a win by UC Santa Barbara corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date of the event and then confirming the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly ignores irrelevant results and predictions, focusing solely on verified outcomes from the event. The response also correctly notes that there were no indications of postponement or cancellation, which matches the conditions provided for resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using several sources, ensuring the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (UC Santa Barbara win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the user prompt's ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response effectively uses the information available and adheres strictly to the user prompt's requirements without adding unnecessary speculation or irrelevant details.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
