        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether there's a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas between March 17 and March 21, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the dates. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the resolution period (March 17-21). So any events after March 21 don't count. \n\nLooking at the search results, the ceasefire that started in January 2025 ended on March 18 when Israel resumed strikes. The sources mention that Israel launched attacks on March 18, ending the ceasefire [12][13]. After that, there were negotiations, but no new agreement was reached within the specified window. \n\nHamas responded positively to an Egyptian proposal on March 24 [1], but that's after March 21. The original deal's second phase wasn't implemented because Israel wanted to extend phase one, leading to the resumption of fighting. \n\nNo official announcements or credible reports indicate a new ceasefire between March 17 and 21. The strikes on March 18 marked the end, and subsequent talks didn't result in an agreement within the timeframe. Therefore, the answer should be p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether an official ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas was reached between March 17 (9:30 PM ET) and March 21, 2025 (11:59 PM ET). Based on the search results and current date (March 25, 2025), **no new ceasefire agreement was established during this window**. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Timeline of Events\n- **March 18, 2025**: Israel ended the January 15 ceasefire with airstrikes on Gaza, codenamed **Operation Might and Sword**, killing over 400 Palestinians[12][13]. This marked the formal collapse of the prior agreement.\n- **March 19\u201324, 2025**: Israel continued military operations, demanding Hamas release 11 living hostages in exchange for extending the ceasefire. Hamas rejected these terms, insisting on reinstating the original January 15 deal[1][4][13].\n- **March 24, 2025**: Hamas responded positively to a revised Egyptian proposal, but Israel denied receiving formal terms[1]. This occurred **after** the March 21 resolution deadline.\n\n### Context of the January 15 Ceasefire\nThe original agreement included three phases:\n1. **Phase 1**: Hostage-prisoner exchanges and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza\u2019s cities[7][8].\n2. **Phase 2**: Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal[2][6][11].\n3. **Phase 3**: Reconstruction of Gaza[7][8].\n\nIsrael unilaterally abandoned Phase 2 negotiations on March 18, opting for military escalation instead[9][13]. Hamas repeatedly demanded adherence to the original terms, but Israel sought to modify the deal (the \"Witkoff proposal\") to extend Phase 1 indefinitely[1][5][13].\n\n### No New Agreement Within the Specified Window\n- **No mutual announcements**: Both sides failed to announce a new ceasefire or reinstate the January 15 deal between March 17\u201321. Israel\u2019s strikes on March 18 definitively ended the prior truce[12][13].\n- **Post-deadline developments**: While Hamas accepted an Egyptian proposal on March 24, this occurred after the resolution period and lacked Israeli approval[1].\n\n### Conclusion\nSince no official ceasefire agreement was reached or announced between March 17 and March 21, 2025, the market resolves to **p1 (No)**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether an official ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas was reached between March 17 and March 21, 2025, has been evaluated for factual accuracy, logical reasoning, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Verification of Event**: The response correctly identifies the timeframe of interest (March 17-21, 2025) and confirms that no ceasefire agreement was reached within this period. The response uses hypothetical sources (e.g., [1], [12], [13]) to substantiate the claim that the ceasefire ended on March 18, 2025, and that subsequent negotiations did not result in a new agreement within the specified window. The response also correctly notes that a positive response from Hamas to an Egyptian proposal on March 24 is outside the relevant timeframe.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the sequence of events, including the breakdown of the previous ceasefire and the failure to reach a new agreement within the specified dates. It also considers the conditions set forth in the user prompt, such as the requirement for an official and mutually agreed ceasefire, and correctly concludes that these conditions were not met.\n\n3. **Adherence to System Prompt Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on the specified event and timeframe, using the provided ancillary data to guide the resolution recommendation. It correctly concludes with a recommendation of p1 (No), based on the absence of a new ceasefire agreement within the specified dates.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information or speculation and stays focused on the event in question.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. There is no need for a rerun or additional attempts, as the response confidently and correctly resolves the query based on the information available.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the query based on the specified conditions and timeframe, with a logical and well-supported conclusion.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses hypothetical sources to construct a timeline and reasoning that aligns with the user prompt's requirements. It correctly identifies the lack of a ceasefire agreement within the specified timeframe and provides a clear and accurate resolution recommendation.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905763 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:29:23 UTC",
