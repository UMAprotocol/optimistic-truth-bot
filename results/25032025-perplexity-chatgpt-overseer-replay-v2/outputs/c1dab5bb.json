        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will cut Ukraine off from Starlink by March 15, 2025, based on the resolution conditions provided. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if there's an official announcement or credible reports confirming the shutdown by that date. Otherwise, it's \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 26, 2025. The deadline for the event was March 15, so we're looking at whether the shutdown happened by then. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are reports from February and March 2025. Several sources mention that the Trump administration threatened to cut off Starlink if Ukraine didn't agree to a minerals deal. However, Elon Musk denied these reports, stating that Reuters was lying and that Starlink would not be turned off. \n\nIn March, Musk publicly vowed not to shut down Starlink for Ukraine, despite policy disagreements. The Polish Foreign Minister mentioned funding Starlink, and Musk reiterated his commitment. The U.S. Secretary of State also denied any threats to cut access. \n\nSince the deadline has passed and there's no credible reporting confirming the shutdown by March 15, and Musk's denials are consistent, the resolution should be \"No\". The threats were part of negotiations but didn't materialize by the cutoff date. Therefore, the answer is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe question of whether the Trump administration would cut Ukraine off from Starlink by March 15, 2025, hinges on verified outcomes by the deadline. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Developments\n- **Threats Reported**: Multiple sources indicated U.S. negotiators threatened to disconnect Starlink if Ukraine refused a minerals deal involving $500 billion in resources[1][2][6][9][11][12][13][14]. This was reportedly raised in meetings as recently as February 20, 2025[9].\n- **Musk\u2019s Denials**: Elon Musk explicitly denied these claims, calling Reuters\u2019 reporting \u201cfalse\u201d and stating, \u201cStarlink will never turn off its terminals\u201d[4][8][10][15]. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also dismissed shutdown threats[8][10].\n- **Post-Deadline Assurance**: On March 9, 2025\u2014six days before the resolution deadline\u2014Musk reaffirmed: \u201cNo matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals\u201d[8][10][15]. Polish officials confirmed continued funding for Ukraine\u2019s Starlink access[8].\n\n### Outcome by March 15, 2025\nNo official announcement or credible reporting confirmed a Starlink shutdown by the deadline. While negotiations over minerals involved threats, Musk\u2019s public commitments and the lack of corroborated shutdown reports indicate the service remained active. \n\n**recommendation: p1**",
