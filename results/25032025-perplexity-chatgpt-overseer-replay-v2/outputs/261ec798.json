        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Volodymyr Zelenskyy will say \"Trans\" during his press conference with the Irish PM. Wait, no, actually, the query is about whether Donald Trump said the term \"Trans\" during his press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if Trump uses the term, considering pluralization, possessive, or compound words. The resolution source is the video of the press conference.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's look through the sources. The user provided 19 search results, many of which detail the meeting between Trump and Martin. \n\nLooking at source [4], which is a YouTube video transcript, Trump mentions \"Rosie o'Donnell\" moving to Ireland, but that's not relevant. Then in the same source, there's a part where Trump says, \"why in the world would you let Rosie o' {ts:93000} Donal move to Ireland I think she's going to lower your happiness level...\" Not seeing \"trans\" here.\n\nSource [17] and [18] are more promising. Source [17] is an article titled \"Trump ripped for bizarrely saying 'everything is transgender' at meeting with Irish PM.\" The article mentions Trump's comments during the press conference, where he states, \u201cEverything is transgender. Everybody transgender. That's all you hear about.\" The article also includes a tweet with a video clip of Trump making these remarks. \n\nSource [18] from PinkNews confirms this, stating Trump said, \u201cEverything is transgender. Everybody transgender. That is all you hear about...\" during the press conference with Martin. \n\nAdditionally, source [19] is a YouTube video of the meeting. The transcript includes Trump saying, \"everything's transgender, everybody transgender, that's all you hear about...\" which directly uses the term \"transgender,\" which includes \"trans\" as a compound word. According to the resolution conditions, compound words count, so \"transgender\" would qualify as containing \"trans.\"\n\nThe resolution conditions state that any usage of the term \"trans\" regardless of context counts, including compound words. Since \"transgender\" includes \"trans,\" this meets the criteria. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). The updates mention the event occurred at 5 PM ET on March 12, which aligns with the sources' dates (March 12-13, 2025). There's no indication the event was canceled, and the video evidence confirms Trump used the term.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n- **Event Occurrence:** The St. Patrick's Day press conference between Donald Trump and Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin occurred as scheduled on March 12, 2025[1][4][5][8].\n- **Term Usage:** During the press conference, Trump explicitly used the word \"transgender\" multiple times, including the statement:  \n  *\"Everything is transgender. Everybody transgender. That\u2019s all you hear about\"*[17][18][19].  \n  The term \"transgender\" contains the compound word \"trans,\" which qualifies under the resolution conditions[17][18].\n- **Context Relevance:** The usage occurred during the Q&A portion of the press conference, which falls within the scope of the market\u2019s resolution criteria[17][19].\n\n**Conclusion:** The term \"trans\" (as part of \"transgender\") was definitively used by Trump during the event, meeting the resolution conditions for \"Yes\" (p2).",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment with the facts provided in the user prompt and updates.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event in question is Donald Trump's press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025, and not with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, correcting the initial confusion in the user prompt. The response correctly focuses on whether the term \"trans\" was used by Donald Trump, adhering to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt regarding the resolution of the market based on the use of the term in any context, including compound words.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a thorough analysis by examining multiple sources that confirm Donald Trump's use of the term \"transgender\" during the press conference. It logically deduces that \"transgender\" qualifies as a compound word containing \"trans,\" meeting the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The response also correctly notes that the event was not canceled and that the term was used within the context of the press conference, which is relevant for the market's resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event through multiple sources and confirms that the term \"trans\" was used as part of \"transgender.\" This aligns with the resolution conditions that any form of the term \"trans,\" including in compound words, counts towards the market resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm the facts and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it accurately and completely addresses the query based on the user prompt and provided sources. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) is well-supported by the evidence and reasoning provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and comprehensively addresses the query, correctly interpreting the event and the usage of the term 'trans' as per the conditions specified in the user prompt. The recommendation aligns with the verified facts and logical analysis.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively corrects the initial confusion in the user prompt, uses multiple sources to verify the occurrence and specifics of the event, and aligns the recommendation with the resolution conditions provided. No significant issues were found in the analysis or the conclusion.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985976 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:46:16 UTC",
