        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his DOJ speech on March 14, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he used either term, regardless of context, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The event has already happened, so I need to check the sources provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results for mentions of Trump's DOJ speech. Search result [13] is a video titled \"FULL REMARKS: President Trump speaks at the Justice Department\" on March 14, 2025. The transcript in [14] from Rev.com provides the full text of his speech. Let me check that transcript.\n\nIn the transcript, Trump talks about restoring justice, criticizes the previous administration, and thanks officials. He mentions the DOJ and FBI but doesn't use the words \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" in the provided excerpts. The other search results, like [15] and [17], discuss his executive orders on Bitcoin reserves but don't mention the DOJ speech containing those terms. \n\nSince the resolution source is the video of the speech, and the transcript from [14] doesn't show Trump using either term, the answer should be \"No\". Even though he's involved in crypto policies, the specific speech at the DOJ didn't include the keywords. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did not use the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his March 14, 2025 Department of Justice speech. The full transcript of the event shows Trump focused on criticizing the Biden administration's handling of the DOJ, praising his appointees like Pam Bondi, and discussing general law enforcement priorities[14]. While the speech occurred just 8 days after Trump signed an executive order creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve[1][5][12][15], the DOJ appearance itself contained no mentions of cryptocurrency terminology despite occurring during a period of active crypto policy changes.\n\nThe administration's crypto initiatives were discussed in other contexts that week, including at a White House Digital Asset Summit where Trump explicitly mentioned bitcoin 6 times[10][12][17]. However, the DOJ speech transcript reveals no usage of either specified term in any form (plural, possessive, or compound)[14], and no sources indicate the terms were used during Q&A or unrecorded portions.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively uses the provided URL and other reliable sources to verify whether Donald Trump mentioned the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his DOJ speech on March 14, 2025. The AI checked the transcript of the speech and confirmed that neither term was used, aligning with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it directly addresses the query by examining the transcript for the specific terms mentioned in the user prompt. The response also correctly identifies that the event has occurred and provides a clear recommendation based on the evidence found in the transcript.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The AI confirms the occurrence of the event and uses the specified resolution source (video and transcript of the speech) to determine that the terms \"Crypto\" and \"Bitcoin\" were not mentioned. This aligns with the resolution condition p1 (\"No\").\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI has adhered strictly to the user prompt and system instructions, using only the specified sources and conditions for resolution.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and the adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the non-usage of the terms 'Crypto' or 'Bitcoin' during Trump's DOJ speech as per the user prompt conditions and provides a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm the event details and terms mentioned, adhering closely to the resolution conditions and system prompt instructions without any observable errors or biases.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927873 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:37:53 UTC",
