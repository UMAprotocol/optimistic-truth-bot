        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump issued an executive order on March 13, 2025, based on specific resolution conditions. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if an executive order was signed and published on that date, otherwise \"No\" (p1). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of an executive order on March 13. Let's go through the sources. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention March 13 as a deadline for federal agencies to submit plans for layoffs and reorganization. For example, source [1] states that agencies were directed to submit plans by March 13. Source [3] and [12] also mention the March 13 deadline for reorganization plans. However, these are directives for agencies to submit their plans, not the signing of an executive order by Trump on that date.\n\nSource [6] mentions that on March 13, 2025, the Trump Administration petitioned the Supreme Court regarding an executive order on birthright citizenship. However, this is a legal filing, not the signing of a new executive order on that day. The original executive order in question was signed on January 20, 2025, as per sources [5] and [6].\n\nSource [8] discusses an executive order signed on March 20, 2025, about federal workforce suitability. Source [9] mentions an executive order signed on March 14, 2025, which rescinded a previous order. Source [11] notes an executive order on March 14 eliminating certain agencies. None of these are dated March 13.\n\nThe key point is whether Trump signed an executive order on March 13 itself. The resolution conditions specify that the order must be published on the White House page or Federal Register by the deadline. The search results don't indicate any executive order published on March 13. The March 13 date in the sources refers to agency submission deadlines, not the issuance of a new order. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, there's no evidence of an executive order signed and published on March 13, 2025. The market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results, there is no evidence that President Trump signed an executive order on March 13, 2025. The March 13 date referenced in multiple sources[1][3][12] pertains to a **deadline for federal agencies to submit reorganization and layoff plans** under a previously issued executive order, not the signing of a new executive order on that date.  \n\nKey details:  \n- The February 2025 executive order[1][3][12] directed agencies to submit workforce reduction plans by March 13, 2025.  \n- On March 13, 2025, the Trump Administration petitioned the Supreme Court[6] to enforce a January 20, 2025, birthright citizenship executive order, but this was a legal filing rather than a new executive action.  \n- Other executive orders mentioned in the search results were signed on **January 20** (birthright citizenship)[5][6], **March 14** (agency eliminations)[11], and **March 20** (federal workforce suitability)[8], but none on March 13.  \n\nThe resolution criteria specify that the executive order must be published on March 13, 2025, on official channels like the White House presidential actions page or the Federal Register. No such publication is documented in the provided sources.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response is based on a thorough examination of the specified sources and aligns with the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that no executive order was signed by Donald Trump on March 13, 2025, as per the sources checked. It correctly distinguishes between different types of presidential actions and deadlines, focusing strictly on the signing of an executive order on the specified date, which aligns with the user prompt's requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources, dismissing references to other dates and focusing on the specific date in question. It provides a clear rationale for why the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1), based on the absence of any executive order signed and published on March 13, 2025.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the non-occurrence of the event (signing of an executive order on the specified date) through multiple sources and aligns its recommendation (p1) with this verified fact. The use of the specified URLs and the adherence to the conditions that only publications on the official White House page or Federal Register count towards the resolution are correctly applied.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934249 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:24:09 UTC",
