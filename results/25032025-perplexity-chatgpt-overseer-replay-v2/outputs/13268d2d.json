The ancillary data specifies that if Villanova wins, it's p1; Seton Hall, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 12 has already occurred. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles confirm the result. Source [1] states Seton Hall lost 67-55 to Villanova. Source [2] also reports Villanova's 67-55 victory. Source [6] and [8] reiterate the same score, with Villanova advancing. All sources agree that Villanova won decisively. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the event occurred and Villanova won, the resolution should be p1. I need to ensure that all citations are correctly applied to each relevant fact. The answer should clearly state the outcome, cite the sources, and end with the recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe Seton Hall Pirates faced the Villanova Wildcats in the BIG EAST Tournament first-round game on March 12, 2025, at Madison Square Garden. **Villanova won the game 67-55**, advancing to the quarterfinals[1][2][6][8]. \n\nKey details:\n- Villanova built a **35-17 halftime lead** despite Eric Dixon (Villanova's leading scorer) being scoreless in the first half[2][8].\n- Seton Hall's Isaiah Coleman scored a game-high 25 points but couldn't overcome the early deficit[1][6].\n- Villanova's defense held Seton Hall to **30.8% shooting in the first half** (8-26 FG)[6].\n- The Wildcats maintained control through second-half contributions from Dixon (19 points) and Wooga Poplar (13 points, 10 rebounds)[2][6].\n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, meeting all conditions for resolution. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Seton Hall vs. Villanova game occurred on March 12, 2025, and that Villanova won the game 67-55. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution, where a Villanova win corresponds to a resolution of p1. The response correctly cites multiple sources confirming the outcome, ensuring that the information is reliable and verified.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the event's outcome. It checks the date to confirm the event is in the past and verifies the outcome through multiple sources. The response also provides additional details about the game, such as halftime scores and individual performances, which, while not necessary for the resolution, enrich the context and confirm the thoroughness of the source checking.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It aligns the recommendation (p1) directly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Villanova win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information or assumptions beyond what is required for the resolution. It sticks strictly to the facts needed to resolve the query.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Seton Hall vs. Villanova game, adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, and provides a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome, provides additional context for verification, and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929260 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:01:00 UTC",
