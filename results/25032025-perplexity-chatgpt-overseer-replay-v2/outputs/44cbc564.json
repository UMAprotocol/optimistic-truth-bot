        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the fight between Marcin Tybura and Mick Parkin at UFC Fight Night on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Tybura wins, it's p2; if Parkin wins, p1; and if it's a draw or postponed/canceled after April 22, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). The current date is March 26, 2025, so the event has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] is a YouTube video titled \"Marcin Tybura Becomes First to Defeat Mick Parkin\" from March 22, 2025. The transcript mentions the fight going to a decision with Tybura winning all three scorecards.\n- Source [4] from Cageside Press on March 23, 2025, states the official result as a unanimous decision win for Tybura (29-28 on all cards).\n- Source [6] (ESPN's fight center) lists the result as a unanimous decision win for Tybura.\n- Source [7] from Sportsnet confirms Tybura's victory by decision, noting the judges scored it for him despite Parkin's corner thinking they won the first round.\n- Source [8] from MMA Decisions details the judges' scores, all 29-28 for Tybura.\n\nAll credible sources agree that Tybura won by unanimous decision. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. The resolution conditions state that ESPN is the primary source, but other credible reports can be used. ESPN's result (source [6]) aligns with the others. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2 (Tybura).\n</think>\n\nMarcin Tybura defeated Mick Parkin via unanimous decision (29-28 on all three judges' scorecards) at UFC Fight Night: Leon Edwards vs. Sean Brady on March 22, 2025. The bout went the full three rounds, with Tybura securing the victory through effective grappling and strategic control despite Parkin's strong second-round performance[1][4][6][7][8]. The official result was confirmed by ESPN and multiple MMA news outlets, with no indication of postponement, cancellation, or draw[6][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742986127 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:48:47 UTC"
