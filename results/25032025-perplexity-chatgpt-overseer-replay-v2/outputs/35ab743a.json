The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chattanooga vs. Middle Tennessee basketball game that was scheduled for March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Chattanooga wins, the market resolves to p2; if Middle Tennessee wins, p1; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was supposed to happen on March 18, so it's already in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game's result. Source [1] states that Chattanooga won 109-103 in triple overtime. Source [2] and [3] also show the final score as 109-103 in favor of Chattanooga. Source [5] from the Chattanooga Mocs' official site confirms their victory, and source [6] from ESPN's recap also reports the same result. \n\nAll these sources are consistent, so there's no ambiguity. The game wasn't postponed or canceled; it was played as scheduled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Chattanooga won, the market should resolve to p2. I need to make sure there's no conflicting information, but all sources agree. No mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being rescheduled or any disputes about the result, but none of the sources indicate that. The detailed box scores and recaps from official team websites and reputable sports sites like ESPN solidify the outcome. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Chattanooga Mocs defeated the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders 109-103 in triple overtime on March 18, 2025, in the first round of the NIT. The game was played as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations. Multiple sources confirm the final score and outcome[1][2][3][5][6]. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Chattanooga's Bash Wieland (31 points), Trey Bonham (27 points), and Honor Huff (clutch 3-pointer in 3OT) led the scoring effort[5][6].\n- Middle Tennessee's Camryn Weston (31 points) and Essam Mostafa (30 points, 16 rebounds) had standout performances[1][6].\n- The game featured 11 ties and 10 lead changes, extending to three overtimes before Chattanooga secured the win[1][5].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The evaluation of the Perplexity AI oracle response reveals that it has adhered well to the instructions provided in the system prompt and has accurately resolved the query based on the event's outcome. Here is a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Chattanooga vs. Middle Tennessee game occurred on March 18, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. The AI used multiple sources to confirm that Chattanooga won the game, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions. The response adheres to the instruction to resolve based on verified facts and does not speculate or predict outcomes.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date of the event and then confirming the outcome through reliable sources. It includes specific details about the game, such as the score and key players' performances, which supports the credibility of the resolution. The AI checks for any possible discrepancies or additional conditions (like postponement or cancellation) but finds none, leading to a clear resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Chattanooga win) is based on consistent information from multiple sources, including the official site and ESPN. This shows a thorough verification process and alignment with the facts as required.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI has covered all necessary aspects to resolve the query accurately.\n\nGiven the above points, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, confirming that the market should resolve to p2 based on Chattanooga's win.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the market based on the verified outcome of the Chattanooga vs. Middle Tennessee game, adhering to all specified instructions and conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, factually accurate, and logically sound, with thorough verification of the event's outcome through multiple reliable sources.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
