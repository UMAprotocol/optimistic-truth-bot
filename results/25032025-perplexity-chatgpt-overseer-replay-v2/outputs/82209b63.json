        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Hawks vs. Hornets game on March 18, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hawks win, it's p2 (Hawks), Hornets win p1 (Hornets), postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 18, so the event date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [1] from YouTube mentions the Hawks defeated the Hornets 134-102 on March 18. Source [2] from thescore.com also lists the final score as 134-102 in favor of the Hawks. Similarly, source [4] from ajc.com and [7] from Fox Sports both report the Hawks' victory with the same score. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game happening on March 18, so no indication of postponement or cancellation. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are clear: Hawks win is p2. Since multiple reliable sources confirm the Hawks won decisively, the resolution should be p2. Also, checking for any conflicting information, all sources align on the outcome. No need to consider p3 or p1 here. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks defeated the Charlotte Hornets 134-102 on March 18, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources including official NBA highlights[1], box scores[2][7], and game recaps[4][8]. Trae Young led the Hawks with 31 points and 8 assists[1][4], while the Hornets were missing key players LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges[4][8]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][2][4][5][7][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

It uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is that the Hawks defeated the Hornets 134-102. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Hawks win corresponds to a recommendation of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response thoroughly checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled and confirms that it occurred as scheduled. It cross-verifies the outcome using several sources, ensuring that the recommendation is based on consistent and corroborated information. The response also correctly ignores any irrelevant conditions (like postponement or cancellation) since they do not apply.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, including official NBA highlights and game recaps from reputable sports news websites. The recommendation of p2 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has not used any irrelevant or unverified sources and has stuck strictly to the facts required to resolve the query.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is both accurate and complete, adhering strictly to the system prompt instructions and correctly applying the ancillary data to arrive at the appropriate resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple reliable sources and aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response demonstrates thorough verification and logical reasoning, ensuring that all conditions and outcomes are considered and appropriately applied.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
