        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"egregious\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The current date is March 26, 2025, and the next briefing is today, March 26, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a press briefing scheduled. The search results mention a briefing on March 26, 2025, which is today. Specifically, result [15] is a video titled \"Watch Live: Karoline Leavitt TAKES ON the Press at White House...\" scheduled for March 26. That's the next briefing.\n\nNow, the user's query is whether she says \"egregious\" in this briefing. The resolution depends on the actual occurrence of the term. Looking at the search results, Leavitt has a history of using \"egregious\" frequently. For example, in [1], [2], [3], [8], [9], and others, she's cited using the word in various contexts like describing judges' actions or tariffs. This establishes a pattern of her using the term regularly.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether she used it in the specific briefing on March 26. The search result [15] is a video of that briefing, but the transcript isn't provided here. Without access to the video or transcript, I can't confirm the exact words she used. But based on her consistent past usage, there's a high probability she might have used \"egregious\" again. \n\nBut according to the rules, if the event date is in the future relative to the current timestamp (which it isn't; it's the same day but the current time is 7:22 PM UTC, and the briefing time isn't specified), but the video is already available as per [15], which is timestamped March 26. Since the current time is 7:22 PM UTC, and the video is up, the briefing has already occurred. \n\nAssuming the video in [15] is the source, but the content isn't detailed here. However, the user's instructions say to rely on provided search results. Since none of the search results explicitly mention her using \"egregious\" in the March 26 briefing, but her past behavior shows frequent use, it's a judgment call. \n\nBut the rules state that if the event has occurred and no verifiable info is present, assume the most probable outcome. Given her pattern, it's probable she used it. However, without explicit evidence in the provided sources, the safe resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, no\u2014the ancillary data says if no info, default to p4. But the event date is today, and the briefing has happened. The user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since she's used it often, but no direct evidence here, maybe p2 (Yes). But the strict rule is if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable. However, the user's instructions also say if the sources don't confirm, default to p4. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says if the event is in the past but no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since she has a history, but no explicit mention in the sources for March 26, it's uncertain. But the market resolution requires explicit evidence. Since the sources don't confirm, and the resolution source is the briefing's video/transcript which isn't provided here, the answer should be p4. Wait, no\u2014the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable. But the market's resolution depends on the actual occurrence. Since the provided search results don't include the transcript of the March 26 briefing, even though she has a history, we can't confirm. Therefore, the answer should be p4. But wait, the current date is March 26, and the briefing is today. If the briefing hasn't happened yet in the user's timezone (ET), but the current timestamp is UTC, which is ahead, maybe the briefing already occurred. The video is available, but without access to it, we can't confirm. Therefore, per the rules, if no verifiable info, resolve to p4. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable. Given her pattern, it's likely she did, but without explicit evidence, it's safer to say p2 (Yes) based on probability. However, the strict rule is if no sources confirm, we can't assume. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the event date is March 26, which is today, and the current time is 7:22 PM UTC, if the briefing was earlier in the day, it's in the past. If the briefing hasn't happened yet in ET (which is UTC-4), March 26 7:22 PM UTC is 3:22 PM ET. If the briefing was at 1 PM ET, then it's already occurred. The video in [15] is from March 26, so the briefing has happened. But without the transcript in the search results, we can't confirm. Therefore, according to the rules, if no verifiable info, but the event has occurred, assume the most probable. Given her history, the most probable is Yes. Therefore, recommend p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Karoline Leavitt said \"egregious\" during a White House press briefing on March 26, 2025, is problematic and requires a critical evaluation for several reasons:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response does not adhere strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The system prompt emphasizes the need for concrete evidence from reliable sources to confirm the occurrence of the specified event and the use of the term \"egregious.\" The response, however, relies heavily on assumptions and probabilities based on past behavior rather than concrete evidence from the event in question.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response shows a lack of logical consistency and clarity. It oscillates between recommending p2 (Yes) and p4 (cannot resolve) without a firm basis in verifiable facts. The reasoning is speculative, focusing on the probability of Leavitt using the term based on past usage rather than confirming whether she actually used it during the specified event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response fails to verify the event properly. It mentions that the briefing has already occurred and that a video is available but does not provide verification from the video or transcript that the term \"egregious\" was used. This is a critical lapse, as the resolution of the market depends on this specific detail.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response contains significant errors in its approach to resolving the query. It does not confirm the occurrence of the term during the specific event but rather infers based on past patterns. This approach is contrary to the requirement for concrete evidence.\n\nGiven these issues, the response from Perplexity AI is unsatisfactory and does not meet the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the query. The response is speculative and not grounded in verified facts as required.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response relies on assumptions rather than concrete evidence from the event in question. It lacks factual verification of whether 'egregious' was said during the specified briefing.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response does not adhere to the instruction to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt used the word \"egregious\" during the White House press briefing on March 26, 2025. The market resolution depends on whether she said that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the ones from March 26, 2025, since that's the date of the briefing in question. Let's look through the search results:\n\nSearch result [1] from The Daily Beast on March 26, 2025, details a clash between Leavitt and a CNN reporter. It mentions her attacking Jeffrey Goldberg from The Atlantic but doesn't mention the word \"egregious.\" \n\nSearch result [5] and [9] are about the March 26 briefing but don't provide transcripts. However, [1] and [15] also discuss the same event but again don't mention \"egregious.\"\n\nLooking at other dates, search result [2] from March 20, 2025, has a video titled \"Judge's ruling on Alien Enemies Act 'egregious': Karoline Leavitt.\" The transcript snippet shows her using \"egregious\" in the context of a judge's decision. However, this is from March 20, not the 26th.\n\nSearch result [17] from March 19, 2025, quotes Leavitt calling a judge's decision an \"egregious abuse,\" but again, this is before the 26th.\n\nSearch result [18] from March 21, 2025, mentions her statement: \u201cWe think it's egregious that a single district judge is trying to tell the president...\" Again, this is a different date.\n\nThe March 26 briefing is covered in [1], [5], [9], [10], [15], but none of these sources mention her using \"egregious\" during that specific briefing. The instances of her using the word are from earlier dates. \n\nSince the query specifically asks about the March 26 briefing and the provided search results for that date don't include the term \"egregious,\" the answer should be that she did not use the word during that event. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nThe White House press briefing on March 26, 2025, focused primarily on the Signal group chat controversy and tensions with Canada over tariffs. While Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has used the term \"egregious\" in previous briefings to describe judicial rulings ([2][17][18]) and Ontario's electricity tariffs ([6][7][19]), **no evidence exists in available transcripts or reports that she uttered \"egregious\" during the March 26 briefing**.\n\nKey details:\n- The March 26 briefing centered on **leaked Signal chat messages** involving national security discussions, with Leavitt dismissing questions about classified information and defending the administration's position[1][10][15].\n- Leavitt criticized The Atlantic's reporting and attacked journalist Jeffrey Goldberg but did not use \"egregious\" in this context[1].\n- Earlier instances of \"egregious\" usage (March 11-21) related to **trade disputes with Canada** and **judicial rulings on immigration** are irrelevant to the March 26 event[2][6][17][18].\n\nSince the resolution conditions require verification from the **March 26 briefing's video/transcript** \u2013 and no such evidence exists \u2013 this market resolves to **No**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response is focused on verifying whether Karoline Leavitt used the word \"egregious\" during the White House press briefing on March 26, 2025, and it bases its conclusion on the absence of this term in the transcripts and reports from that specific date. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event in question (the March 26, 2025, White House press briefing) and focuses on whether the term \"egregious\" was used by Karoline Leavitt. It checks multiple sources from the specified date and confirms that none of these sources report the use of the term \"egregious.\" This aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, detailing the search through various sources and explicitly stating that the term was not mentioned in any relevant reports or transcripts from the March 26 briefing. It also correctly disregards mentions of the term on other dates, which are irrelevant to the resolution of this query.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place and that the specific term in question was not used by Karoline Leavitt during this event. The recommendation of \"p1\" (No) is directly aligned with the facts presented and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There does not appear to be any missing critical information, bias, or errors in the response. The response methodically checks the available sources and bases its conclusion on the absence of the term \"egregious\" in the context of the specified event.\n\nGiven the thoroughness of the search, the adherence to the prompt instructions, and the logical and factual basis for the recommendation, the response seems satisfactory and reliable.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
