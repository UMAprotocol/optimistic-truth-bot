The ancillary data specifies that if Duke wins, it's p1; if St. Mary's wins, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Looking at the search results, multiple sources (like [2], [6], [8], [9]) confirm that Duke won the game 93-49. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game took place on March 21. \n\nNext, verify the teams involved. The query mentions \"St. Mary's,\" but the opponent is Mount St. Mary's. The search results consistently refer to Mount St. Mary's, so I need to ensure they're the same team. All sources, including [4] from Mount St. Mary's athletics, confirm they're the correct team. The user might have abbreviated the name, but the context matches.\n\nCheck for any discrepancies. All reports state Duke's victory, so the outcome is clear. No sources mention postponement or cancellation. The resolution conditions are met for p1 (Duke win). Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nDuke defeated Mount St. Mary's 93-49 in their NCAA Tournament first-round matchup on March 21, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[2][6][8][9]. The game occurred as scheduled at 2:50 PM ET at Raleigh's Lenovo Center with no postponement or cancellation reported[2][5][6]. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Duke dominated from the start, leading 54-28 at halftime and maintaining control throughout[2][7]\n- Tyrese Proctor led scoring with 19 points, while freshman Cooper Flagg contributed 14 points in his return from injury[6][8]\n- The Blue Devils shot 50% from the field with 14 three-pointers and only 2 turnovers[2][6]\n- Mount St. Mary's shot 30.2% from the field and 18.5% from three-point range[6][9]\n\nThis decisive outcome meets the resolution criteria for a Duke victory as defined in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
