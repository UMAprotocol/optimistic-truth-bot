        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Zelensky\" two or more times during her next White House press briefing. The ancillary data specifies that pluralization or possessive forms count, but other forms don't. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) otherwise. If there's no briefing by the end of 2025 or she's no longer press secretary, it's \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after March 25, 2025. The current date given is March 25, 2025. The search results include briefings up to March 25, 2025, like the YouTube video from Hindustan Times on that date. However, the user is asking about the \"next\" briefing after this date. The search results don't mention any briefings scheduled after March 25. \n\nNext, looking at Leavitt's history, she frequently mentions Zelensky in briefings. For example, on March 1, 2025, she criticized Zelensky multiple times [2][6][9]. On March 19 and 20, there were briefings where she discussed Trump's calls with Zelensky and mentioned him several times [11][12][13][14]. The March 25 briefing also references Zelensky [3]. However, these are all before or on the current date. \n\nSince the query is about the next briefing after March 25, and there's no information on upcoming briefings, we can't confirm if she will mention Zelensky twice. Additionally, the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025. Without evidence of a future briefing, and considering the possibility that Leavitt might not hold another briefing, the resolution should default to p4. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the user's ancillary data says resolution_conditions: p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the instructions say to recommend p1-p4. However, the personalization section says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. Wait, the query's resolution conditions don't include p4. The ancillary data says if the event hasn't occurred yet, return p4. Since the event (the next briefing) is in the future relative to March 25, 2025, the current date, we should check if the event date is in the future. The next briefing hasn't happened yet, so according to the rules, we should return p4. \n\nBut wait, the query's ancillary data says if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). However, the event in question is whether Leavitt says \"Zelensky\" 2+ times in the next briefing. Since the next briefing is a future event as of March 25, and we can't verify if it will happen, the correct recommendation is p4 because the event hasn't occurred yet. The user's personalization instructions state that if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. Even if the event is on the same day but later, it's still future. Since the current time is 12:39 PM UTC on March 25, and the latest briefing mentioned is on March 25 but the exact time isn't specified, if the next briefing is after 12:39 PM, it's still future. However, the search result [3] is from March 25, but the video's title mentions a \"new shock to Zelensky,\" which might indicate that in that briefing, Zelensky was mentioned. But the user's query is about the next briefing after March 25. Unless the March 25 briefing is considered the \"next\" one, but the current time is 12:39 PM. If the briefing happened after that time, it's future. However, without explicit timestamps, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the requirement to return p4 for future events, the recommendation should be p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Zelensky\" two or more times in the next White House press briefing after March 25, 2025, is generally well-reasoned and adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response correctly identifies that the event in question is scheduled for a future date and therefore cannot be resolved at this time, leading to the recommendation of p4. This is in line with the system prompt's directive to return p4 for events scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with the response that need addressing:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly notes that the event is in the future and thus unresolved as of the current date. However, it initially seems to confuse the resolution conditions by mentioning p1, p2, p3, and p4, which could lead to ambiguity. The response should clearly state that p4 is the only valid recommendation since the event has not occurred yet.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking for scheduled briefings and noting the lack of information about future briefings. It also correctly interprets the ancillary data regarding how the market should resolve under different outcomes. However, the response could improve by more clearly stating that since the event is in the future, no other resolution condition applies except p4.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response aligns with the facts that the next briefing is a future event and thus cannot be resolved. However, it could emphasize more clearly that the lack of information about future briefings directly leads to the recommendation of p4.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response initially shows some confusion about the resolution conditions but corrects itself towards the end. It could be improved by eliminating this confusion and directly stating the appropriate resolution based on the system prompt's instructions.\n\nGiven these considerations and the critical rule that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always get a RETRY verdict, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response correctly identifies that the event is in the future and recommends p4, but it shows some initial confusion about the resolution conditions. A retry could clarify these points and ensure the response is unambiguous and strictly adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should directly state that p4 is the only valid recommendation for future events without initial confusion about other resolution conditions.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Zelensky\" two or more times during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 for uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the event in question is a future press briefing. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since the query is about the \"next\" briefing and there's no specific date provided, it's inherently a future event. According to the guidelines, if the event is in the future, the recommendation should be p4. But wait, the ancillary data mentions a deadline of December 31, 2025. However, the current date is March 25, 2025, so the next briefing could happen any time between now and the end of 2025. \n\nLooking at the search results, there are several briefings mentioned up to March 2025, but none beyond that. The latest briefing referenced is on March 25, 2025, which is the same as the current date. The user's query is about the \"next\" briefing after this date. Since no information is available about future briefings post-March 25, we can't verify if Leavitt will mention \"Zelensky\" twice. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, it resolves to No. But since we don't have information on whether a briefing will happen or not, and the event is in the future, the correct recommendation is p4. The guidelines emphasize that future events default to p4, especially when there's no verifiable information. \n\nThe search results do show that Leavitt has mentioned Zelensky multiple times in past briefings, but past performance doesn't guarantee future occurrences. Without confirmation of the next briefing's content, we can't definitively answer Yes or No. Therefore, p4 is the appropriate recommendation.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\n**Key Analysis:**  \nThe query concerns whether White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt will say \"Zelensky\" at least twice during her next press briefing. However, the event in question is scheduled for a future date (the \"next\" briefing after March 25, 2025).  \n\n- **Future Event:** The resolution explicitly depends on a future briefing, and no verifiable information exists about its occurrence or content. The current timestamp (March 25, 2025) confirms this is unresolved.  \n- **Lack of Definitive Information:** While Leavitt has frequently referenced Zelensky in past briefings (e.g., discussing negotiations over Ukraine\u2019s mineral rights and ceasefire efforts[1][2][4][8][12]), future briefings are inherently speculative.  \n- **Resolution Protocol:** Per the guidelines, **p4** is the only valid recommendation for unresolved future events.  \n\nThis recommendation aligns with the requirement to default to p4 when no verifiable outcome exists.",

As per the guidelines provided, future events should be resolved with a recommendation of p4, indicating that the query cannot be resolved at this time due to the lack of verifiable information about future events. The response adheres to this instruction accurately and logically concludes that p4 is the appropriate recommendation based on the current date and the nature of the query.\n\nThe response also correctly notes that there is no specific information available about the next briefing after March 25, 2025, further supporting the use of p4. It acknowledges the lack of definitive information about future briefings and the content of such briefings, which aligns with the requirement to base resolutions on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly stating that it has checked for any available schedules or announcements regarding future briefings and found none. This would strengthen the justification for recommending p4 by demonstrating a thorough search for relevant information.\n\nAdditionally, while the response mentions that Karoline Leavitt has frequently referenced \"Zelensky\" in past briefings, it could clarify that past occurrences do not influence the resolution of future-based queries unless specific predictive information is available, which in this case, it is not.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response has fundamentally adhered to the guidelines by recommending p4 for a future event, and considering the critical rule that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always be followed by a retry, the following decision is appropriate:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the event as future and unresolved, correctly applying the p4 recommendation.
