The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each relevant source. \n\nSearch result [1] mentions Trump's speech at the DOJ. The article quotes him saying, \u201cspied on my campaign; launched one hoax and disinformation operation after another; broke the ...\u201d. Here, he uses the word \"hoax\" in the context of past investigations. That's a direct mention.\n\nSearch result [7] from The Telegraph also reports Trump's speech, stating he claimed the DOJ was corrupt and \"launched one hoax and disinformation operation after another\". This corroborates the use of \"hoax\".\n\nSearch result [9] from UPI quotes Trump as saying the DOJ and FBI \"launched one hoax and disinformation operation after another\". Again, \"hoax\" is used.\n\nSearch result [14] includes a tweet quoting Trump's speech where he mentions \"hoax\" in the same context. \n\nOther sources like [2], [4], [5], [6], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [15], [16] don't mention the speech or the specific term. \n\nSince multiple sources confirm Trump used \"hoax\" during his DOJ appearance, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\". The exact term was used, meeting the resolution conditions. No conflicting information found. The event occurred as scheduled, so no cancellation issues.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did use the term \"hoax\" during his March 14, 2025 Department of Justice speech. Multiple sources confirm he stated that DOJ and FBI officials \"launched one **hoax** and disinformation operation after another\" when referencing investigations into his campaign and administration[1][7][9]. This direct usage of the exact term meets the resolution criteria specified in the ancillary data, regardless of context or pluralization considerations.\n\nThe speech occurred as scheduled and was publicly aired, with video evidence available through news coverage and official transcripts. No cancellation or technical issues affected the event. Trump's repeated emphasis on alleged \"hoaxes\" formed a key part of his grievances against federal law enforcement agencies during this address[1][7][9].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931464 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:37:44 UTC",
