The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Texas vs. Texas A&M college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Texas wins, the market resolves to \"Texas\" (p2), if Texas A&M wins, it's \"Texas A&M\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game happened 12 days ago. That means the event has already occurred, so no need to check for postponement or cancellation. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking through the search results, several sources confirm the game's result. Source [1] from the Texas Longhorns' official site states they won 94-89 in double overtime. Source [2] from Fox Sports also reports Texas's victory, mentioning they kept their NCAA Tournament hopes alive. Source [7] from ESPN's recap details the game, including Tre Johnson's crucial 3-pointer in double OT leading to Texas's win. Additionally, source [6] from 12thMan.com (Texas A&M's site) confirms the loss, and source [10] from Texas's site previews the game and later sources confirm the outcome.\n\nAll these sources consistently report that Texas won the game. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2, which corresponds to Texas winning. The answer is straightforward since all evidence points to Texas's victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Texas Longhorns defeated the Texas A&M Aggies 94-89 in double overtime during the SEC Tournament Second Round on March 13, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the outcome, including official team reports[1][7], sports news outlets[2][6], and ESPN's game recap[7]. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with Texas securing the victory through key plays in the second overtime[1][7]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Texas vs. Texas A&M basketball game) occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. It verifies the outcome using multiple reliable sources, including official team sites and reputable sports news outlets, which all confirm Texas's victory. This adherence to using verified facts to resolve the query aligns perfectly with the system prompt requirements.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the sequence of checks required by the system prompt: confirming the event date, verifying the event has occurred, and checking multiple sources for the outcome. It correctly ignores possibilities of postponement or cancellation since the event date is in the past and there is no indication from the sources that such circumstances occurred.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and provides a detailed account of the game's outcome, which matches the user prompt's resolution conditions. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Texas win) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has used a comprehensive set of sources to confirm the event outcome and has not shown any bias towards one source over another.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is both accurate and complete, adhering strictly to the system prompt instructions without any deviations or errors. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple reliable sources and aligns perfectly with the system prompt instructions and ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified facts to resolve the query and adheres to all specified conditions without any observed errors or biases.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929455 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:04:15 UTC"
