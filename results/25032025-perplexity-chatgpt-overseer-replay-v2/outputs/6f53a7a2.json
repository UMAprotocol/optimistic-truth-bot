        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the Flames vs. Islanders game scheduled for March 22, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve under different scenarios: p1 for Islanders win, p2 for Flames win, p3 if the game is canceled, and the market stays open if postponed. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is three days after the game's scheduled date. The search results include sources from March 21 and 22, 2025, discussing the game's odds and predictions. Notably, there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in the provided results. \n\nLooking at the sources, [1] and [4] both mention the game date as March 22, 2025, and provide predictions and odds, indicating the game was expected to proceed. Source [7] even gives a post-game analysis, suggesting the Flames won 3-2. However, the user's query doesn't include direct post-game results, so I need to rely on the available data. \n\nSince the game was scheduled for March 22 and the current date is March 25, if the game had been postponed or canceled, there would likely be mentions in the search results. The absence of such information implies the game took place as planned. \n\nThe next step is determining the winner. Source [7] explicitly states a prediction of Flames winning 3-2. While this is a prediction, the lack of conflicting information in other sources and the fact that the game date has passed without reports of cancellation or postponement supports the conclusion that the Flames won. \n\nTherefore, based on the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Flames). There's no indication of cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. The game wasn't postponed, so the market doesn't stay open. The correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Calgary Flames vs. New York Islanders NHL game scheduled for March 22, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET occurred as planned with no evidence of postponement or cancellation in the search results[1][4][7]. While multiple sources provided pre-game predictions, one analysis explicitly forecast a 3-2 Flames victory[7]. Given the current date (March 25, 2025) and absence of contradictory reports about game outcomes, cancellation, or postponement, the most probable resolution aligns with the ancillary data's p2 condition for a Flames win.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The evaluation of the Perplexity AI oracle response reveals several critical points that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the date of the event and checks whether it has occurred relative to the current timestamp. It also correctly identifies the conditions under which the market should resolve (p1 for Islanders win, p2 for Flames win, p3 if canceled). However, the response mistakenly uses a prediction (Flames winning 3-2) as a fact for resolving the market. Predictions are not factual outcomes and should not be used to determine the resolution of the event.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows through the steps of checking the event date and searching for information on postponement or cancellation. However, it fails in the final step by using a predicted outcome instead of a confirmed result to resolve the market. This is a significant error as the oracle's function is to report on verified facts, not predictions or probabilities.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not provide evidence of a verified outcome of the game. It relies on a source that offers a prediction, which is not sufficient for resolution. There is no concrete evidence cited that confirms the game's result.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The major error in the response is the reliance on predictive information rather than confirmed outcomes. This misalignment with the requirement for factual verification leads to an inaccurate resolution recommendation.\n\nGiven these points, the response from Perplexity AI does not meet the required standards for accuracy and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The use of a predicted outcome to resolve the market is a fundamental flaw.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly used a predicted game outcome instead of a verified factual result to resolve the market.\",\n  \"critique\": \"Future attempts must ensure that the resolution is based on confirmed and verified outcomes of the event, not on predictions or pre-game analyses.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Calgary Flames vs. New York Islanders game on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Flames win, it's p2, and if the Islanders win, it's p1. The game was scheduled for that date, and the current date is March 25, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the game's outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] states that Nazem Kadri scored in overtime, giving the Flames a 4-3 win. \n- Source [2] from ESPN also confirms the Flames won 4-3 in OT.\n- Source [3] is an Islanders article acknowledging their 4-3 OT loss.\n- Source [4] and [5] are video highlights showing the Flames' victory.\n- Other sources like [8], [9], and [10] all repeat the same result: Flames won in overtime.\n\nAll sources consistently report the Flames as the winner. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so the resolution isn't p3. Since the Flames won, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p2. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources agree. No mention of the game being rescheduled or canceled. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Calgary Flames defeated the New York Islanders 4-3 in overtime on March 22, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources. Nazem Kadri scored the game-winning goal at 3:51 of overtime, securing the Flames' third consecutive victory[1][2][3][8][9][10]. Key details include:\n\n**Game Timeline**  \n- **First Period**: Matt Coronato (Flames) opened scoring at 0:36, but the Islanders responded with goals from Bo Horvat (10:46) and Marc Gatcomb (17:41)[2][3][8].  \n- **Second Period**: Coronato tied the game 2-2 at 6:03[2][8].  \n- **Third Period**: Kyle MacLean gave the Islanders a 3-2 lead at 17:09, but Jonathan Huberdeau equalized 29 seconds later[1][3][8].  \n- **Overtime**: Kadri\u2019s decisive goal ended the game at 3:51 of OT[1][2][5][9].  \n\n**Key Performances**  \n- **Flames**: Huberdeau (1 goal, 2 assists), Coronato (2 goals), and Rasmus Andersson (3 assists)[1][2][8].  \n- **Islanders**: Marcus Hogberg made 31 saves, while Noah Dobson and Maxim Tsyplakov each recorded two assists[1][3][8].  \n\nThe game concluded as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][2][9]. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p2** (Flames win).  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
