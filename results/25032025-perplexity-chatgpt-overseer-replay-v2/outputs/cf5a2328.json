        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know whether Ajax or Eintracht Frankfurt advanced in the UEFA Europa League matchup based on the provided search results. The ancillary data specifies that if Frankfurt advances, the market resolves to p1 (Frankfurt), and if Ajax advances, it's p2 (Ajax). If the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the dates of the matches. The search results mention two legs: the first leg on March 6, 2025, and the second leg on March 13, 2025. Both dates are before the current date of March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred. No postponement or cancellation is indicated in the sources, so p3 isn't applicable here.\n\nLooking at the first leg, Ajax lost 2-1 at home. The second leg results from multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [5]) report that Frankfurt won 4-1 in the second leg, leading to an aggregate score of 6-2. All sources confirm Frankfurt's advancement to the quarter-finals. There's no mention of any cancellations or disputes that would affect the outcome. \n\nSince the resolution source is official UEFA information, and all the provided search results align in reporting Frankfurt's victory and progression, the market should resolve to p1 (Frankfurt). No conflicting information is present, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nEintracht Frankfurt advanced to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals after defeating Ajax Amsterdam 4-1 in the second leg on March 13, 2025, securing a 6-2 aggregate victory[1][2][4][5]. The first leg on March 6, 2025, saw Frankfurt come from behind to win 2-1 in Amsterdam[1][7], with goals from Hugo Larsson and Ellyes Skhiri[1][6]. In the decisive second leg, Mario G\u00f6tze scored twice, while Jean-Matt\u00e9o Bahoya and Hugo Ekitik\u00e9 added goals to complete the comprehensive victory[1][2][4]. Ajax's lone second-leg goal came from Kenneth Taylor when the match was already decided at 3-1[1][4].\n\nThe result was confirmed through multiple official match reports and statistics showing Frankfurt's dominance in both legs[1][2][4][5]. As the event concluded before March 25, 2025, and met all competition requirements without postponement, the resolution aligns with Frankfurt's advancement.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
