The ancillary data specifies that if the Jets win, it's p2 (Jets), if the Kraken win, p1 (Kraken), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 16, so the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 5, 6) report the game took place on March 16. The detailed recaps mention the Jets won 3-2 in overtime. \n\nI should verify the final score and ensure there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. All sources confirm the game was played, with a clear outcome. The AHF rulebook (4) and Alliance Hockey (8) discuss cancellation policies, but there's no indication here that the game was affected. \n\nSince the Jets won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Winnipeg Jets and Seattle Kraken on March 16, 2025, concluded with a **3-2 overtime victory for the Jets**, as confirmed by multiple verified game recaps[1][2][5][6]. The Jets overcame a two-goal deficit, with Dylan Samberg scoring the decisive goal 1:47 into overtime[1][5]. Since the game was completed as scheduled and resulted in a Jets win, the market resolves to **\"Jets\"** per the ancillary data's resolution conditions. There is no evidence of postponement or cancellation requiring alternative resolution.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

It verifies through multiple sources that the game took place as scheduled and that the Winnipeg Jets won the game. This is in line with the system prompt requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for the occurrence of the game, its outcome, and any potential cancellations or postponements. Finding none, it concludes based on the outcome of the game (Jets win), which aligns with the ancillary data provided (p2 for Jets win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Jets win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has adhered strictly to the user prompt and system instructions without adding unnecessary information or speculation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931914 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:45:14 UTC",
