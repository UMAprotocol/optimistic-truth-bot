The ancillary data specifies that if Mt. St. Mary's wins, the market resolves to them (p2), and if Marist wins, it resolves to Marist (p1). If postponed, it stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 13 is definitely in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome of the game using the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, several articles (7, 8, 9, 11, 12) report that Mount St. Mary's defeated Marist 62-58 in the MAAC Tournament quarterfinal on March 13. For example, source [7] from the Mount St. Mary's athletics site confirms the final score and that they advanced. The AP reports in [8] and [12] also back this up. \n\nSince the game occurred and the result is clear, there's no need to consider postponement or cancellation. The ancillary data says a Mt. St. Mary's win resolves to p2. All the credible sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between Mt. St. Mary's and Marist scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET occurred as planned. According to multiple verified sources, **Mount St. Mary's defeated Marist with a final score of 62-58** in the MAAC Tournament quarterfinals[7][8][9][11][12]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was definitively determined.  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided:  \n- A Mt.

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of event, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Mt. St. Mary's vs. Marist game occurred on March 13, 2025, and that Mt. St. Mary's won with a score of 62-58. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution, where a win by Mt. St. Mary's corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event is in the past. It then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple credible sources, which is a robust approach to ensure accuracy. The response does not unnecessarily delve into conditions that did not occur, such as postponement or cancellation, since the game was played as scheduled.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, which is a strong point in ensuring the reliability of the information. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria effectively. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and aligns perfectly with the user prompt's instructions and ancillary data. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, providing a well-reasoned and factually supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923887 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:31:27 UTC"
