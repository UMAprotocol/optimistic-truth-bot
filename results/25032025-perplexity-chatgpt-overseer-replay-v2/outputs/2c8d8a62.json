        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Denver Nuggets vs. Golden State Warriors game scheduled for March 17, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Nuggets win, it's p2; Warriors win, p1; postponed remains open, and canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 17, so the event date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 5, 6, 8) confirm that the game took place on March 17. The final score from the ESPN recap [5] shows Nuggets 114, Warriors 105. Aaron Gordon and Russell Westbrook led the Nuggets to victory despite missing key players like Jokic and Murray. \n\nThe Warriors were favorites, but the Nuggets won, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Nuggets). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in the search results. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Denver Nuggets defeated the Golden State Warriors 114-105 in their March 17, 2025 matchup at Chase Center[1][5][6][8]. Despite being short-handed without Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, Denver secured the road victory behind Aaron Gordon's season-high 38 points and Russell Westbrook's triple-double (12 points, 16 assists, 12 rebounds)[1][5]. Golden State's seven-game winning streak was snapped despite Jimmy Butler's 23-point performance[5].\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1][5][6][8]. All available evidence confirms the final outcome occurred under normal game conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response correctly identifies that the Nuggets won the game, which according to the ancillary data should resolve the market to \"p2\".\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It provides a detailed description of the game, including key players and scores, which supports the resolution decision. The reasoning is thorough and follows the logical steps required by the system prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was neither postponed nor canceled. It aligns the recommendation of \"p2\" directly with the verified outcome of the Nuggets winning the game. This is consistent with the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on verified facts and adheres strictly to the user prompt's instructions without introducing any irrelevant information or speculation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925443 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:57:23 UTC"
