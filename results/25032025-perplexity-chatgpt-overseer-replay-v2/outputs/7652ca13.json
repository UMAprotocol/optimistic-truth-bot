        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Iowa State made the 2025 Final Four, with the market resolving to \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on their advancement. The ancillary data specifies that if the team is eliminated, it resolves to \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The Final Four is scheduled for April 5, 2025, so the event hasn't happened yet. But the key is whether Iowa State is still in the tournament or has been eliminated.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [8] from cyclones.com states that Iowa State's men's team lost to Ole Miss 91-78 in the Round of 32 on March 23, 2025. This elimination means they can't advance further. Additionally, result [15] and [16] confirm this loss, ending their season. \n\nThe women's team, mentioned in [3] and [13], was eliminated earlier in the tournament, so they're out too. Since both teams are eliminated, there's no possibility for Iowa State to reach the Final Four. The resolution condition says if eliminated, resolve to \"No\". Therefore, the answer should be p1.\n</think>\n\nIowa State University's men's basketball team was eliminated from the 2025 NCAA Tournament in the Round of 32, losing to sixth-seeded Ole Miss 91-78 on March 23, 2025[8][15][16]. The Cyclones entered the tournament as a No. 3 seed but failed to advance beyond the second round, finishing their season with a 25-10 record[8]. \n\nThe women's basketball team was also eliminated earlier in the tournament, falling to Michigan 80-74 in their first-round matchup on March 21, 2025[3][13]. With both teams officially eliminated from tournament contention before the Final Four stage, Iowa State cannot advance to the 2025 NCAA March Madness Final Four.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response is factually accurate, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question (Iowa State's participation in the 2025 Final Four) is scheduled for a future date, but the team's elimination from the tournament has already occurred, which is a critical factor for resolution. The response uses verified sources (cyclones.com and other results) to confirm that both the men's and women's basketball teams of Iowa State have been eliminated from the tournament, thus making it impossible for them to advance to the Final Four.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows the conditions set in the user prompt that if Iowa State is eliminated, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). It provides specific details about the games in which the teams were eliminated, including scores and dates, which supports the resolution decision.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the elimination of Iowa State from the NCAA tournament through multiple sources and aligns this information with the resolution recommendation of p1. This is consistent with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the necessary information to resolve the query and does not include irrelevant details.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation of p1 is justified based on the verified elimination of Iowa State from the tournament, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the elimination of Iowa State from the NCAA tournament and correctly applies the resolution conditions from the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is factually accurate, logically sound, and adheres to the system prompt instructions without any apparent errors or biases.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928159 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:42:39 UTC",
