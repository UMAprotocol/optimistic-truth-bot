        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Lone'er Kavanagh vs. Felipe dos Santos fight at UFC Fight Night 255. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Santos winning, p2 is Kavanagh, and p3 is a draw or unresolved. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the fight date of March 22, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the fight happened as scheduled. The search results mention the fight was on March 22, 2025, at the O2 Arena in London. Results from sources [3], [9], and [10] confirm that the fight took place. Specifically, [3] states that Kavanagh won by unanimous decision, and [9] provides a detailed account of the fight, including Kavanagh's victory. \n\nNext, verifying the resolution source. The ancillary data says ESPN is the primary source, but credible reporting can be used. Checking [7], ESPN's profile for Felipe dos Santos lists the fight result as a loss for him, with Kavanagh's record updated to 9-0. Additionally, [9] from Bleacher Report and [10] from Sherdog both report Kavanagh's unanimous decision win. \n\nThere's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. All sources point to the fight occurring as planned with a clear outcome. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Kavanagh won, the market should resolve to p2. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources align on the result, so the answer is straightforward. The recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nLone'er Kavanagh defeated Felipe dos Santos by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night 255 on March 22, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources. The official result, reported by ESPN's fighter profile for dos Santos, lists Kavanagh's victory[7]. Detailed fight coverage from Bleacher Report describes Kavanagh's aggressive performance and the judges' scorecards (29-28 across all three)[9], while Sherdog's Fight Facts notes his successful decision win[10]. The bout occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
