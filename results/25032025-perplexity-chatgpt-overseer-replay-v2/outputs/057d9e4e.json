The market resolves to Yes (p2) if he did, No (p1) otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of the term \"deregulation\" in Trump's speech. The search results include transcripts and articles about the speech. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at result [4], the transcript of Trump's remarks at the DOJ on March 15, 2025. The provided transcript excerpts don't include the word \"deregulation.\" He talks about corruption, weaponization, and restoring justice, but not deregulation.\n\nResult [6] is another transcript. The excerpts here mention firing officials, Hunter Biden's laptop, and other topics, but again, no \"deregulation.\"\n\nResult [9] and [10] discuss Trump's speech where he criticized opponents and talked about accountability, but no mention of deregulation.\n\nResult [12] from ABC News quotes Trump talking about turning the page on corruption and weaponization, but again, no \"deregulation.\"\n\nResult [13] from The Daily Signal mentions Trump's focus on fighting fentanyl and crime, but the term isn't there.\n\nResult [14] and [15] also summarize the speech, highlighting expelling rogue actors and other issues, but no mention of deregulation.\n\nOther results like [2] and [3] discuss Trump's deregulation efforts in general but not during the specific DOJ speech in question.\n\nSince none of the sources directly quoting the speech include the word \"deregulation,\" and the resolution conditions require the term to be spoken during the event, the answer should be No. The ancillary data specifies that any usage counts, but the transcripts and articles don't show it was used. Therefore, the market resolves to p1: No.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump delivered a speech at the Department of Justice on March 14, 2025, focusing on themes of corruption, weaponization of justice, and restoring law enforcement priorities. An analysis of multiple transcripts and news reports covering the event shows no instance where Trump used the term **\"deregulation\"** during his remarks[4][6][9][12][14]. While Trump referenced executive orders signed earlier in his term[2][5], these were not mentioned during this specific DOJ appearance. The speech instead emphasized retaliatory actions against political opponents, critiques of media coverage, and claims about restoring impartial justice[7][10][12].\n\nThe resolution criteria specify that **any usage** of the term \"deregulation\" (including plural/possessive forms) during the event would trigger a \"Yes\" outcome. However, all available evidence from primary sources confirms the term was not uttered in this context. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively analyzes the user's query regarding whether Donald Trump used the term \"Deregulation\" during his DOJ appearance on March 14, 2025. The AI checks multiple sources, including transcripts and news articles, to determine if the term was mentioned during the speech. The response is thorough in detailing the content of the speech and confirming that the term \"Deregulation\" was not used, aligning with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it systematically reviews relevant sources and directly addresses the query by confirming the absence of the term \"Deregulation\" in the speech. The AI's decision to recommend resolution p1 (No) is based on concrete evidence from the transcripts and news reports, which is in line with the requirements to use verified facts and direct evidence from the event.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The AI confirms that the event took place on the specified date and that the term in question was not mentioned. This ensures that the resolution recommendation is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes, as required by the system prompt.\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI effectively uses the sources specified in the user prompt and does not deviate from the event's context or the terms outlined for resolution.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately addresses the user's query based on verified sources and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and logically sound, with a clear and accurate conclusion based on the evidence provided.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907326 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:55:26 UTC",
