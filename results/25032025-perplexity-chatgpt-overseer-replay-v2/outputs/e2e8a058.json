The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Wichita State vs. Oklahoma State basketball game that was scheduled for March 18 at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Oklahoma State wins, it resolves to p1, Wichita State to p2, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 18, so the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, all sources [1] through [8] report that Oklahoma State defeated Wichita State 89-79 in the NIT first round on March 18. For example, source [1] states the final score clearly, and others like [2], [3], and [7] confirm the same outcome. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed stats and player performances, which wouldn't make sense if it were canceled. Therefore, the game was completed as scheduled. \n\nSince Oklahoma State won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no ambiguity here because all sources agree on the result, and the game wasn't postponed or canceled. The ancillary data's conditions are met for a p1 resolution.\n</think>\n\nOklahoma State defeated Wichita State 89-79 in their NIT first-round game played on March 18, 2025, at 8:00 PM CT (9:00 PM ET) in Stillwater[1][2][3][7]. The game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any of the sources[1-8]. \n\nBryce Thompson led the Cowboys with 23 points and five steals[1][2][7], while Wichita State's Xavier Bell scored a game-high 24 points in his final collegiate appearance[3][6]. Oklahoma State secured the lead for good at 53-52 with 12:44 remaining in the second half[1][2][7] and maintained a double-digit advantage for the final 10 minutes[4][8].\n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **Oklahoma State** as they won the completed game. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the occurrence of the Wichita State vs. Oklahoma State basketball game, confirms the outcome, and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game took place on March 18, 2025, and that Oklahoma State won against Wichita State with a score of 89-79. The AI checks for any possible postponements or cancellations and confirms that the game was completed as scheduled. This aligns with the user prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date and occurrence of the event, followed by confirming the outcome and checking for any deviations like postponements or cancellations. The AI then concludes with a recommendation based on the outcome, which is logically derived from the verified facts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's verification process involves checking multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring that the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The alignment of the recommendation (p1 for an Oklahoma State win) with the ancillary data is precise and correct.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has covered all necessary aspects to make an informed resolution based on the user prompt and system instructions.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and the adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and comprehensive, effectively using verified sources to confirm the event details and outcome.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934883 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:34:43 UTC",
