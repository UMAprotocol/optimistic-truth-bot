        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump used either \"Crooked Joe\" or \"Sleepy Joe\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he said those exact terms, including their possessive or plural forms, but not other variations. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and summaries of Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit. Let's go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it's a summary of Trump's speech. The article mentions Trump criticizing the Biden administration's regulatory approach but doesn't quote him using either nickname. Similarly, source [2] discusses his emphasis on US leadership in crypto but again no mention of the nicknames. \n\nSource [3] provides a full transcript of the speech. Translating the content, there's no instance of \"Crooked Joe\" or \"Sleepy Joe\" here. He refers to Biden by name but not the nicknames. \n\nSource [4] includes direct quotes from Trump's speech. He mentions Biden's actions, like selling Bitcoin reserves, but again uses \"Biden\" without the nicknames. The same pattern is in source [5], where Trump contrasts his policies with Biden's but doesn't use the nicknames.\n\nSource [7] from CoinDesk also quotes Trump criticizing Biden's regulatory policies but uses \"Biden\" directly. Source [8] from Fox Business similarly quotes Trump referring to \"Biden\" without the nicknames. \n\nSources [9] and others like [12], [16], [17], [18], [19] mention Trump using \"Crooked Joe\" or \"Sleepy Joe\" in other contexts, but these are from different events or speeches, not the Digital Asset Summit. For example, source [9] is about a 2024 G7 summit incident, and source [12] is a Libertarian event. \n\nThe key here is that the query specifically asks about the Digital Asset Summit speech on March 20, 2025. All the direct quotes and transcripts from that event (sources [1]-[8], [10], [13]-[15]) do not include the terms \"Crooked Joe\" or \"Sleepy Joe\". Trump refers to Biden by his last name or as \"the last administration\" but doesn't use the nicknames in question during this particular speech.\n\nAdditionally, the updates mention that the video address counts, so even though it was pre-recorded, it's still part of the event. However, since the nicknames weren't used there either, the answer should resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not use the terms \"Crooked Joe\" or \"Sleepy Joe\" during his March 20, 2025, video address to the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit in New York. Analysis of the speech\u2019s full transcript and multiple verified summaries confirms Trump referred to his predecessor as \"Biden\" or \"the last administration\" but did not employ either nickname specified in the resolution conditions[1][3][4][7][8].  \n\nKey contextual points:  \n- The 3-minute pre-recorded speech focused on cryptocurrency policy, including initiatives like the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and criticism of Biden-era regulations[4][5][7].  \n- Trump contrasted his administration\u2019s approach with Biden\u2019s actions, stating: *\"Biden foolishly sold [crypto assets] at far below their long-term value\"*[3][4], but avoided using \"Crooked Joe\" or \"Sleepy Joe\"[1][3][7].  \n- While Trump has used these nicknames extensively at other events (e.g., 2024 campaign rallies[12][19], G7 commentary[9]), they were absent from this specific summit appearance[1][3][4].  \n\nThe resolution source \u2013 the official video of the speech \u2013 contains no instances of the specified terms in any grammatical form[14]. As the event occurred as scheduled and no qualifying terms were used during the address, the market resolves to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment with the facts of the event. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions provided in the user prompt. It correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on whether Donald Trump used the terms \"Crooked Joe\" or \"Sleepy Joe\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The response thoroughly checks multiple sources, including transcripts and summaries of the speech, to confirm that these specific terms were not used.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically examining relevant sources to ensure that the terms in question were not mentioned in any form during the speech. It also correctly considers the update that Trump's video address counts towards the market's resolution. The response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the provided conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and that the terms \"Crooked Joe\" or \"Sleepy Joe\" were not used by Trump during his address. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts as verified from multiple sources, confirming that the terms were not used in any context during the speech.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The analysis is based strictly on the content of Trump's speech at the specified event, and it does not deviate into unrelated details or assumptions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation provided by Perplexity AI is accurate and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt instructions, verifies the event properly, and logically analyzes the sources to confirm that the terms 'Crooked Joe' or 'Sleepy Joe' were not used.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930702 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:25:02 UTC",
