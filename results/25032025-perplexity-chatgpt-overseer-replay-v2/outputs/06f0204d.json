The ancillary data specifies that if Arsenal advances, it resolves to p1, PSV to p2, and if canceled/postponed beyond December 31, 2025, it's p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current date given is March 25, 2025. The search results mention the first leg was on March 4, 2025, and the second leg on March 12, 2025. Both dates are in the past relative to the current date, so the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([2], [5], [6], [8], [10], [12], [14], [15]) report that Arsenal defeated PSV Eindhoven with a 9-3 aggregate score. The first leg was a 7-1 victory for Arsenal, and the second leg ended in a 2-2 draw. Since the aggregate score clearly favors Arsenal, they advanced to the quarter-finals. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that advancing to the next round determines the outcome. All sources confirm Arsenal's progression, so the correct resolution is p1 (Arsenal). There's no mention of the match being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nArsenal advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals after defeating PSV Eindhoven with a 9-3 aggregate score in their Round of 16 tie. The first leg on March 4, 2025, saw Arsenal secure a commanding 7-1 away victory at the Philips Stadion[3][6][14]. Key contributions came from Martin \u00d8degaard (two goals), Leandro Trossard, and Riccardo Calafiori, among others[3][6]. \n\nIn the second leg on March 12, 2025, the teams drew 2-2 at the Emirates Stadium[2][5][14]. Despite PSV's goals from Ivan Perisic and Couhaib Driouech, Arsenal's aggregate advantage remained insurmountable[2][15]. The result marked Arsenal's second consecutive Champions League quarter-final appearance[8][15].\n\n**Resolution**: Arsenal progressed to the next round, meeting the conditions for p1 resolution as defined in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906618 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:43:38 UTC"
