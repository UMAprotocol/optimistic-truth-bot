        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Tampa Bay Lightning vs. Dallas Stars game on March 20, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Lightning win, it's p2 (Lightning), and if the Stars win, it's p1 (Stars). Postponed games keep the market open, and canceled games resolve to 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 20, 2025. Sources [1], [2], [3], and [4] all confirm the game occurred with a final result. The Lightning won in a shootout, as detailed in [1], [2], and [3]. The final score was 3-2 in a shootout, with Gage Goncalves scoring the winning goal. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no confusion with other games. There's a mention of another Stars game on March 25 against the Wild in [7], but that's a different game. The March 20 game is clearly covered in the first four sources. \n\nSince the game was played and completed, and the Lightning won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. No postponement or cancellation here. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Dallas Stars scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET was played as planned. The Lightning defeated the Stars 3-2 in a shootout[1][2][3]. Key details:\n\n- Regulation ended 2-2 after Dallas tied the game with a power-play goal in the second period[1][3]\n- Rookie Gage Goncalves scored the shootout winner in the fourth round[1][2]\n- Andrei Vasilevskiy made 22 saves for Tampa Bay[1], while Casey DeSmith stopped 36 shots for Dallas[2][4]\n\nAs the Lightning won the game, per the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to **\"Lightning\" (p2)**. The game was neither postponed nor canceled, and the outcome was definitively determined through standard NHL overtime procedures[1][2][3].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The evaluation of the Perplexity AI oracle response reveals that it has adhered well to the instructions provided in the system prompt and has accurately resolved the query based on the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the NHL game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Dallas Stars took place as scheduled on March 20, 2025. It confirms that the Tampa Bay Lightning won the game, which aligns with the resolution condition p2 (Lightning win). The response uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the game, ensuring that the information is reliable and not based on a single source.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows the steps needed to resolve the query. It checks whether the game occurred, confirms the winner, and cross-references the outcome with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The response also correctly ignores irrelevant games (e.g., the Stars game on March 25 against the Wild) and focuses solely on the game in question.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the game was neither postponed nor canceled. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Lightning\" (p2) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event specified in the user prompt and uses verified sources to substantiate its findings.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the outcome of the event as per the ancillary data provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the event's verified outcome and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and correctly aligned the resolution with the ancillary data.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
