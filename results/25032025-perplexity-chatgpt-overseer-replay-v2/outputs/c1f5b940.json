The ancillary data specifies that if Louisville wins, it's p1; Clemson, p2; postponed stays open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 14, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are about the March 14 game. Results [1], [2], [4], [5], and [6] all mention the March 14 game where Louisville defeated Clemson 76-73. For example, result [1] states Louisville's victory, and [5] from ESPN confirms the score. There's also a YouTube video in [6] reacting to Louisville's win. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources report the game as having occurred, with detailed stats and post-game reactions, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: since Louisville won, the market should resolve to p1. The other results like [3] and [7] are about football and lacrosse games on different dates, so they're irrelevant here. Result [8] is about a women's basketball game, also a different event. \n\nNo conflicting information in the sources. All relevant results confirm Louisville's win. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Clemson vs. Louisville men's basketball game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET concluded with a **76-73 victory for Louisville**[1][2][4][5]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- Louisville led by Terrence Edwards Jr. (21 points) and J\u2019Vonne Hadley (20 points), overcoming a late Clemson rally[1][4].\n- The Cardinals held Clemson without a field goal for over six minutes in the second half to build a 15-point lead[2][5].\n- Clemson narrowed the gap to two points in the final minute, but Louisville secured the win after a critical block by James Scott and a missed three-pointer by Chase Hunter at the buzzer[2][5].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by multiple verified reports of its completion[1][2][4][5][6]. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **Louisville** (p1). \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the outcome of the Clemson vs. Louisville game, confirming that Louisville won with a score of 76-73. The response adheres to the instructions by checking the date of the event and confirming it has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. The response also correctly identifies that the game was neither postponed nor canceled.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first establishing the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly disregards irrelevant information about other sports and focuses solely on the specified basketball game. The reasoning is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, including ESPN and a YouTube video, which are considered reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Louisville\" (p1) aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Louisville win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. All information necessary for the resolution of the query is included, and the response does not exhibit any irrelevant or extraneous details that could indicate bias.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930953 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:29:13 UTC",
