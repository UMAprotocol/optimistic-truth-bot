        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"F-35\" during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of that specific meeting. Looking through the provided sources, result [13] is a video titled \"NATO Secretary General with US President Donald Trump, 13 MAR 2025\". The description mentions statements made at the White House on that date. The transcript includes remarks from both the NATO Secretary General and Trump. \n\nIn the transcript, the Secretary General talks about increased defense spending by European nations but doesn't mention the F-35. Trump's response, as per the transcript, focuses on NATO spending and his role in getting allies to contribute more. There's no mention of the F-35 in his statements here. \n\nOther sources discuss the F-35 in different contexts, like Turkey's exclusion, NATO allies reconsidering purchases, and Germany's commitment. However, these are from different dates (March 19, 20, 21, 22) and not related to the March 13 meeting. \n\nSince the key source [13] directly covers the meeting in question and there's no mention of \"F-35\" in the provided transcript excerpts, the answer should be \"No\". The resolution conditions specify that only the meeting itself counts, and preceding speeches or other events don't qualify. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nThe scheduled meeting between Donald Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte occurred on March 13, 2025, as documented in the official transcript and video recording[13]. During their joint appearance, Trump discussed NATO defense spending and his role in increasing European contributions, but **did not mention the term \"F-35\"** in any context[13]. The NATO Secretary General\u2019s remarks also focused on budgetary commitments rather than specific weapons systems[13].\n\nWhile Trump discussed the F-35 program extensively in other contexts around this timeframe \u2013 including negotiations with Turkey[1][3][10], threats of a \"kill switch\"[4][7], and Boeing\u2019s next-generation fighter contract[5][6] \u2013 these statements occurred outside the scope of the March 13 bilateral meeting. The resolution conditions explicitly limit consideration to the Oval Office meeting with the NATO Secretary General, excluding other events or speeches[ancillary_data].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

It correctly excludes mentions of the F-35 from other dates and contexts, focusing solely on the event specified.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a logical analysis based on the transcript and video evidence from the meeting, confirming that Donald Trump did not mention \"F-35\" during the meeting. It also correctly applies the resolution conditions by excluding irrelevant mentions of the F-35 in other contexts or on other dates.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event through a specific source (video and transcript) and aligns the recommendation (p1 - No) with the facts presented in the source material. This is consistent with the user prompt's requirement to resolve based on concrete evidence from the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event and terms specified in the user prompt, using the correct source for verification.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation of p1 is well-supported by the evidence provided and correctly interprets the resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies and analyzes the event in question, adhering strictly to the resolution conditions and user prompt instructions. The recommendation of p1 is well-supported by the verified source material.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the specified source to verify the occurrence of the event and the absence of the term 'F-35' during the meeting, aligning perfectly with the resolution conditions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933337 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:08:57 UTC",
