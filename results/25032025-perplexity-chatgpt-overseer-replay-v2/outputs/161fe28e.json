The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Charlotte vs. Florida Atlantic CBB game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 2:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Florida Atlantic wins, it resolves to p1; if Charlotte wins, p2; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the event should have already taken place. Now, looking at the search results, several sources confirm the game happened. \n\nSearch result [1] from Florida Atlantic's official site states they won 64-59 on March 13. Similarly, [2] from the American Athletic Conference's site also reports FAU's victory. There's a YouTube highlight video [5] and another [8] both showing FAU's win. The box scores from Charlotte's [6] and FAU's [7] sites also list the game results, with FAU winning. \n\nSome sources like [3] and [10] are predictions before the game, but the actual result is clear from the post-game reports. The date in the query is March 13, which matches the game date in the sources. No mentions of postponement or cancellation, so the result stands. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Florida Atlantic).\n</think>\n\nThe Florida Atlantic Owls defeated the Charlotte 49ers 64-59 in the American Athletic Conference Tournament second-round game on March 13, 2025[1][2][5][8]. Key details include:\n\n- **Game outcome**: Florida Atlantic secured a five-point victory (64-59) to advance to the AAC quarterfinals[1][2].\n- **Performance highlights**: Freshman center Matas Vokietaitis led FAU with 17 points and 7 rebounds, while Charlotte's Nik Graves scored a team-high 14 points[1][2][5].\n- **Context**: This marked FAU's third win over Charlotte in the 2024-25 season[1][6][7].\n\nThe game concluded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, and no evidence suggests the result was later overturned. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Charlotte vs. Florida Atlantic CBB game) occurred on March 13, 2025, and provides a detailed account of the outcome, which is Florida Atlantic winning the game. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome, including official sites and YouTube highlights, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly ignores irrelevant pre-game predictions and focuses on post-game reports to determine the result. The response also checks for any mentions of postponement or cancellation, which there were none, thus adhering to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through credible sources and aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Florida Atlantic win) directly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. This shows a high level of precision and adherence to the resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI has not included any unnecessary or irrelevant information, focusing solely on the event in question as per the instructions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Florida Atlantic win) is based on concrete evidence and established facts, which is exactly what is required from the AI in this scenario.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the event's verified outcome and adheres strictly to the user prompt and system instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and provided a clear, factual resolution recommendation aligned with the ancillary data.\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925227 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:53:47 UTC"
