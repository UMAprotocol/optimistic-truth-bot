The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the search results to confirm the game's outcome. The search results are all from March 22 or 23, 2025, which is after the game date. Let's go through them:\n\n1. The first result from On New Jersey says the Senators came out on top, ending 3-2. [1]\n2. The YouTube video title states the Devils lost 3-2. [2]\n3. CBS Sports recap confirms the Senators won 3-2. [3]\n4. CBS News article also mentions the Senators' 3-2 victory. [4]\n5. Silver Seven Sens article describes the Senators holding off the Devils for a 3-2 win. [5]\n6. YourValley.net and other sources repeat the same score and outcome. [6][7][8][9][10][11]\n\nAll sources consistently report the final score as Senators 3, Devils 2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that a Senators win resolves to p2. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Ottawa Senators defeated the New Jersey Devils 3-2 in their NHL game on March 22, 2025, at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. The Senators established a 3-1 lead in the second period with goals from Brady Tkachuk, Drake Batherson, and David Perron[3][4][6][9], while the Devils' late third-period goal by Erik Haula (scored with 23 seconds remaining) proved insufficient to force overtime[3][4][5][7].

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between Ottawa Senators and New Jersey Devils) occurred on March 22, 2025, and the current date is March 25, 2025, confirming that the event is in the past. The AI checked multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is a Senators win with a score of 3-2. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Senators win should resolve to p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with a verification of the event date and outcome through multiple reliable sources. It then matches the confirmed outcome with the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (Senators win corresponds to p2). The AI also ensures there was no postponement or cancellation, which could affect the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation of p2 is based on verified facts from multiple sources confirming the Senators' win. The response lists specific details from the game, such as the score by period and key players, which supports the credibility of the sources and the final outcome.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The AI strictly adhered to the facts and did not infer or predict outcomes, which is crucial for the integrity of the oracle system.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the outcome of the event as verified by multiple sources.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the specified resolution conditions without any errors or bias.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively gathered and synthesized information from various sources to confirm the event outcome and provided a clear, well-supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929877 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:11:17 UTC"
