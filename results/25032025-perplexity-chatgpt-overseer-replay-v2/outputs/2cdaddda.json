        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because the Israel-Hamas ceasefire was canceled by March 14, 2025. The ancillary data defines \"Yes\" if either party announced cancellation or credible reports confirm it's no longer in effect by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the deadline of March 14 has passed. Now, looking at the search results, especially sources [1], [4], [6], [8], [10], [16], and [18], there are reports of Israel resuming airstrikes on March 18, 2025, which ended the ceasefire. However, the deadline was March 14. \n\nWait, the ceasefire was officially broken on March 18 according to [4] and [16], which is after the March 14 deadline. But the user's query is about cancellation by March 14. So I need to check if there were any announcements or credible reports before March 14 indicating the ceasefire was canceled. \n\nLooking at the sources, [3] from March 24 mentions Hamas responding positively to an Egyptian proposal, but Israel denied receiving terms. [7] from March 2 says Israel cut off aid to pressure Hamas. [9] mentions that on March 1, Hamas rejected an extension proposal, and Israel stopped aid on March 2. However, the ceasefire wasn't officially canceled then; Israel was using aid as leverage. \n\nThe key point is the actual cancellation. The ceasefire ended on March 18 when Israel launched Operation Might and Sword ([4], [16]). Since that's after March 14, the market should resolve to \"No\" because the cancellation happened after the deadline. Even though there were tensions and aid blockades before March 14, the official end was on March 18. Therefore, the answer is \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, established in mid-January 2025, remained technically in effect until March 18, 2025, when Israel launched a large-scale military operation codenamed **Operation Might and Sword** ([4][16]). This operation marked the formal end of the ceasefire, with Israeli airstrikes killing over 400 Palestinians on the first day and subsequent ground offensives splitting Gaza into northern and southern zones ([1][4][6]).  \n\nWhile tensions escalated significantly in early March 2025\u2014including Israel\u2019s aid blockade starting March 2 ([7][9]) and Hamas rejecting U.S.-backed proposals ([3][11])\u2014no official cancellation of the ceasefire by either party or consensus reporting confirming its termination occurred **by the March 14, 2025, deadline**. The decisive breakdown occurred four days after the cutoff date, on March 18 ([4][16][18]).  \n\n**Key timeline**:  \n- **March 1\u201314, 2025**: Negotiations stalled, but the ceasefire framework remained intact despite Israel\u2019s aid restrictions and Hamas\u2019 refusal to accept modified terms ([7][9][11]).  \n- **March 18, 2025**: Israel unilaterally resumed full-scale military operations, ending the ceasefire ([4][16]).  \n\nSince the market\u2019s resolution deadline was March 14, and the ceasefire was not definitively canceled by that date, the outcome aligns with **p1 (\"No\")**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions by checking the timeline and confirming that the current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the deadline of March 14, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the ceasefire was officially broken on March 18, 2025, which is after the specified deadline. This is in line with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by distinguishing between actions taken before and after the deadline and by focusing on whether an official cancellation or a consensus of credible reporting confirmed the ceasefire's end by March 14, 2025. The response correctly concludes that since the ceasefire ended on March 18, the market should resolve to \"No\" because the cancellation happened after the deadline. This reasoning is complete and considers all necessary aspects to reach a conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the facts presented. The sources cited ([1], [4], [6], [8], [10], [16], [18]) are used to establish the timeline of events leading to the ceasefire's end. The response effectively uses these sources to confirm that no official cancellation or consensus reporting indicated the ceasefire's termination by the deadline.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There is no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response thoroughly investigates the conditions set forth in the user prompt and uses relevant sources to substantiate its findings.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, adheres strictly to the instructions, and provides a well-reasoned recommendation based on verified facts. The decision to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) is justified and aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, adheres to the instructions, and logically uses verified facts to reach a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to verify the event timeline and correctly aligns the recommendation with the established facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928341 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:45:41 UTC",
