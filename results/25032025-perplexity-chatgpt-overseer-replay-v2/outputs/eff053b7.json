        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"waste\" three or more times during his DOJ speech on March 14, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that pluralization and possessive forms count, but other forms don't. Also, compound words where \"waste\" is part of it count, like \"wasteful\" or \"wasteland\". The resolution is based on the video of the speech.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for mentions of Trump's speech at the DOJ. Let's go through each source to find instances where he used the word \"waste\".\n\nLooking at source [1], the CBS News article mentions Trump's speech. It quotes him saying, \"We're turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals,\" but there's no mention of \"waste\" here. The article also talks about him suspending security clearances and other actions, but again, no \"waste\".\n\nSource [2] is a YouTube video analysis by Glenn Kirschner. The transcript discusses Trump's speech focusing on grievances and retribution. The user mentions Trump criticizing judges and suggesting prosecuting critics, but no reference to \"waste\".\n\nSource [3] is about a 2016 speech where Trump spoke in front of recyclables mistaken for garbage. This is unrelated to the 2025 DOJ speech, so \"waste\" here isn't relevant.\n\nSource [4] is about the DOJ indicting Trump for mishandling documents. Not related to the speech in question.\n\nSource [5] is a Oneindia News video summary. It mentions Trump slamming investigations and vowing retribution but doesn't note \"waste\".\n\nSource [6] is a 2019 fact-check about environmental claims, irrelevant here.\n\nSource [7] is a White House fact sheet from March 2025 about an Executive Order on eliminating information silos to stop waste, fraud, and abuse. The term \"waste\" is used multiple times in the context of the order, but this is a separate event from the DOJ speech. The Executive Order was signed on March 20, 2025, which is after the March 14 speech. So this doesn't count towards the speech.\n\nSource [8] is a CBS News video where Trump criticizes judges and prosecutors. The transcript doesn't mention \"waste\".\n\nSource [9] from Just Security details past instances where Trump pushed DOJ to prosecute enemies. Not related to the 2025 speech.\n\nSource [10] is a House hearing about government waste, but this is a different event. The hearing was on February 12, 2025, before the DOJ speech. The term \"waste\" is used here, but it's not part of Trump's speech on March 14.\n\nSource [11] discusses Trump pressuring DOJ to overturn the 2020 election. Unrelated.\n\nSource [12] talks about Trump's DOGE department cutting waste, but again, this is a different context and not part of the DOJ speech.\n\nSource [13] is a YouTube video where Trump lists wasteful spending cuts by DOGE on March 4, 2025. He uses \"waste\" in that speech, but this is a separate event from the March 14 DOJ appearance.\n\nSource [14] is a full remarks video from FOX. The summary mentions Trump accusing Biden of turning the DOJ into the \"department of injustice\" and blasting the judicial branch. No mention of \"waste\" here.\n\nNow, cross-referencing all these, the key sources that mention the March 14 speech are [1], [2], [5], [8], and [14]. None of these sources indicate that Trump used the word \"waste\" during that specific DOJ speech. The instances of \"waste\" in sources [7], [10], [12], and [13] are from other events or contexts, not the March 14 DOJ appearance.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided search results, there's no evidence that Trump said \"waste\" three or more times during his March 14, 2025 DOJ speech. The market should resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump's March 14, 2025, speech at the Department of Justice focused on grievances about past investigations, judicial criticism, and pledges to restructure the agency. An analysis of available transcripts and reports from the event shows **no instances** of Trump using the word \"waste\" during this appearance[1][5][8][14]. \n\nKey points from the speech included:\n- Accusations that the DOJ had become the \"department of injustice\" under Biden[14]\n- Praise for Judge Aileen Cannon's dismissal of his classified documents case[1]\n- Calls to prosecute critics of judges[2]\n- Attacks on prosecutors and Biden-era policies[5]\n\nWhile Trump frequently discusses \"waste\" in other contexts (e.g., March 4 remarks about government spending[13] and a March 20 Executive Order targeting bureaucratic inefficiency[7]), these occurred **separately** from the March 14 DOJ event. The resolution criteria specifically require usage during the designated appearance, which available evidence does not support.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions by focusing on the specific event mentioned in the user prompt, which is Donald Trump's speech at the Department of Justice on March 14, 2025. The response correctly identifies and excludes references to \"waste\" from other events or contexts that do not pertain to this specific speech.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically examining each source for mentions of the word \"waste\" during the speech. It provides a thorough analysis by checking multiple sources and confirming that none of these sources reported the use of the word \"waste\" three or more times during the specified event. This thorough check enhances the reliability of the conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and analyzes the content of the speech based on available sources. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) aligns with the facts gathered from the sources, which confirm that the word \"waste\" was not mentioned three or more times during the speech.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response effectively uses the sources provided and relevant to the event in question.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It accurately and completely addresses the query based on the user prompt and system instructions, providing a well-supported recommendation. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and comprehensively analyzes the sources related to the specified event, adheres to the instructions, and logically supports its recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm the absence of the word 'waste' three or more times during the specified event, leading to a well-supported resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935846 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:50:46 UTC",
