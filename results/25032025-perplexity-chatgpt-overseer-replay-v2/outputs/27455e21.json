The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Seattle vs. Abilene Christian college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Seattle wins, it resolves to p2 (\"Seattle\"), if Abilene Christian wins, p1 (\"Abilene Christian\"), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 13, 2025. The current date provided is March 26, 2025, which is after the game date, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the game's outcome using the search results.\n\nLooking through the sources, several mention the game. Source [6] from CBS Sports states that Seattle U defeated Abilene Christian 69-63 in the WAC Tournament's second round on March 13. Similarly, source [10] from the WAC's official site confirms the same score, with Seattle winning 69-63. Source [11] (ESPN) and [12] (Fox Sports) also report Seattle's victory with the same score. Additionally, source [13] from Seattle University's athletics site details their 69-63 win, advancing them to the semifinals.\n\nAll these sources agree on the outcome: Seattle won the game. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Seattle\"). The answer needs to clearly state the result and the corresponding resolution recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe Seattle vs. Abilene Christian college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET was played as planned. According to multiple verified sources, **Seattle defeated Abilene Christian 69-63** in the Western Athletic Conference Tournament quarterfinals[6][10][11][13]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the final outcome is confirmed through official game recaps and box scores.  \n\n**Resolution Recommendation**: The market should resolve to **p2 (\"Seattle\")** based on their victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The AI then verifies the outcome of the game using multiple reliable sources, which all confirm that Seattle won the game. This is in line with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds from verifying the date of the event to confirming its outcome through multiple sources. It correctly applies the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data (p2 for a Seattle win) and provides a clear resolution recommendation based on these conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI checks multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The sources cited (CBS Sports, WAC official site, ESPN, Fox Sports, and Seattle University's athletics site) are appropriate and trustworthy for this type of verification.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not include unnecessary information and focuses solely on the event in question as per the system prompt's instructions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985823 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:43:43 UTC"
