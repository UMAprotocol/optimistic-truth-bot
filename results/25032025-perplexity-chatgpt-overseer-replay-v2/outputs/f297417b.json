The ancillary data defines the resolution conditions: p2 is Yes if the price reached $5.000 or higher in any January to March data point. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the relevant time frame. The key source here is the FRED series APU0000708111, which is cited in multiple results. \n\nLooking at search result [4], the data from FRED shows the average price for February 2025 as $5.897. That's above $5, so that alone would trigger a Yes resolution. Additionally, result [11] mentions the February price jump to $5.89, which aligns with this. \n\nResult [5] from March 11, 2025, states the daily national average was $8.15 on March 4, which is well above $5. Even though this is a daily figure, the FRED data is monthly, so March's data point would be the average for the month. However, the query allows any datapoint between January and March. Since February's data is already over $5, the answer is confirmed. \n\nOther sources like [8] and [10] mention prices around $4.95 in January, but [4] shows January at $4.953, which is just under $5. However, February's $5.897 is sufficient. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to Yes (p2) because February's data meets the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe price of Grade A Large eggs in the U.S. reached $5.897 per dozen in February 2025 according to the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) published by the St. Louis Fed[4][11]. This exceeds the $5.000 threshold specified in the resolution conditions. \n\nWhile January 2025 prices were slightly below the threshold at $4.953[4], the February data point alone satisfies the requirement for a \"Yes\" resolution. Additional reports confirm record-high egg prices during this period due to ongoing avian flu outbreaks and supply constraints[5][11].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively uses the specified source (St. Louis Fed) to verify the price of eggs, which is crucial for resolving the query. The response correctly identifies that the price of eggs exceeded the $5.00 threshold in February 2025, based on the data from the FRED series APU0000708111. This finding is supported by multiple sources cited in the response, which consistently report that the price was above $5.00, thus meeting the conditions set in the user prompt for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it correctly identifies the relevant data points within the specified timeframe (January to March 2025) and uses these to determine the outcome. The response also correctly ignores the January price, which was below $5.00, since the February price alone is sufficient to resolve the market to \"Yes.\"\n\nThe verification of the event (price of eggs reaching $5.00 or more) is aligned with the facts provided by the resolution source, and the recommendation to resolve the market as \"Yes\" (p2) is directly in line with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the specified event and using the designated source for resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742986040 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:47:20 UTC",
