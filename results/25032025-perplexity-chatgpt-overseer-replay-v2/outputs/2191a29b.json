The ancillary data specifies that if the Ducks win, it's p2; if the Stars win, p1; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the game's outcome. Looking at the sources provided, especially the game recaps from sources [1], [6], [7], and [8], they all mention that the Dallas Stars won the game in overtime with a score of 4-3. Mikael Granlund scored the winning goal in OT. The date of the game matches the one in the query, March 18, 2025. \n\nI should verify that the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. No mentions of postponement or cancellation. The Stars' victory is clearly documented across multiple reliable sources like NHL.com and AP News. \n\nSince the Stars won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All the necessary information is consistent across the sources, so there's no ambiguity. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Dallas Stars defeated the Anaheim Ducks 4-3 in overtime on March 18, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][6][7][8]. Mikael Granlund scored the game-winning goal at 2:32 of overtime, securing the Stars' victory. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Regulation ended 3-3, forcing overtime[1][6].\n- Dallas improved to 43-21-3, while Anaheim fell to 29-31-8[1][6].\n- The Stars overcame a 3-2 deficit entering the third period[7][8].\n\nBased on the resolution conditions and the verified outcome, the market resolves to **p1** (Stars win). \n\nrecommendation: p1",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908235 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:10:35 UTC"
