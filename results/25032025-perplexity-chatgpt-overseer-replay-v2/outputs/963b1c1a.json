The key here is to determine if the event happened and what the result was.\n\nFirst, I check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 24, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the sources, several mention the game result. Source [5] is a YouTube video titled \"Game Recap: Suns 108, Bucks 106\" uploaded on March 25, 2025. The description states the Suns won 108-106. Source [8] is another YouTube video from the Phoenix Suns' channel, highlighting their 108-106 victory with Devin Booker hitting the game-winning shot. Source [9] is a box score from FOX Sports confirming the final score as Suns 108, Bucks 106. Source [11] also describes the Suns' win with Booker's last-second shot.\n\nAll these sources consistently report the Suns won. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The ancillary data specifies that a Suns win resolves to p1. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Phoenix Suns and Milwaukee Bucks on March 24, 2025, concluded with the **Phoenix Suns winning 108-106** [5][8][9]. Key highlights include:\n\n- **Kevin Durant** led the Suns with 38 points (7-9 from three-point range) and 8 rebounds [8].\n- **Devin Booker** hit the game-winning step-back jumper with 1.7 seconds remaining [11].\n- The Bucks' Brook Lopez missed a potential game-tying shot at the buzzer [5].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and the result is verified through multiple sources including official game recaps and box scores. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1** (Suns win).\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Bucks vs. Suns game on March 24, 2025) and verifies that it occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. The AI used multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts. The sources mentioned (YouTube videos and FOX Sports box score) are appropriate and reliable for confirming the game's outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm it is in the past and then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources. The AI correctly matches the outcome (Suns win) with the resolution condition provided in the ancillary data (p1 corresponds to a Suns win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through consistent reports across several sources. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Suns win) is directly aligned with the facts verified and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not include irrelevant information or speculate beyond the verified facts. All sources used are directly related to the event in question, and the AI does not stray from the user prompt's instructions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event and the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Bucks vs. Suns game using multiple reliable sources and correctly aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses appropriate sources for verification, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
