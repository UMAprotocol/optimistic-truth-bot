The ancillary data specifies that if Purdue wins, it's p1; McNeese State, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 22, so it's in the past. Now, I need to confirm the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles ([1], [2], [4], [8]) report that Purdue defeated McNeese State with a score of 76-62. For example, source [1] states Purdue's victory and their advancement to the Sweet 16. Source [8] provides detailed stats, including Trey Kaufman-Renn's 22 points and 15 rebounds for Purdue. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources agree on the result, so the outcome is clear. \n\nSince the event occurred, and Purdue won, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information or future dates here. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament game between McNeese State and Purdue occurred on March 22, 2025, as scheduled. Purdue defeated McNeese State by a score of **76-62**[1][2][4][8], advancing to the Sweet 16. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the result was decisively in Purdue's favor, with the Boilermakers leading by double digits early and maintaining control throughout[1][4]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, where a Purdue win corresponds to **p1**, the market resolves to **Purdue**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (McNeese State vs. Purdue game) and its scheduled date. It verifies that the event occurred on March 22, 2025, and provides a clear outcome based on multiple sources, stating that Purdue won the game. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Purdue win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds from verifying the date and occurrence of the event to confirming the outcome through reliable sources. It mentions specific details such as the score and key players, which supports the credibility of the sources and the veracity of the event's outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event against the provided date and confirms that it was neither postponed nor canceled. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Purdue win) directly aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt without introducing any irrelevant information or subjective interpretation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907857 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:04:17 UTC",
