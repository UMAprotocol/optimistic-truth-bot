The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Northern Colorado vs. Cal Irvine CBB game scheduled for March 19, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Cal Irvine wins, it's p1; Northern Colorado, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game was six days ago. That means the event has already occurred. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [7], [8]) report that UC Irvine (Cal Irvine) won the game against Northern Colorado with a score of 82-72. The game took place on March 19 as scheduled, and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. All sources confirm the game was completed, and UC Irvine advanced to the next round of the NIT. \n\nSince the event occurred, and the result is clear, the market should resolve to p1 (Cal Irvine). There's no conflicting information or uncertainty in the sources. The resolution conditions are met, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nUC Irvine (Cal Irvine) defeated Northern Colorado 82-72 in their NIT first-round game played on March 19, 2025, as scheduled. Multiple sources confirm the Anteaters overcame a nine-point second-half deficit to secure the victory[1][2][4][7]. The game was completed without postponement or cancellation, with UC Irvine advancing to host Jacksonville State in the next round[1][3]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"Cal Irvine\" if they win. The response correctly uses the current date to establish that the event is in the past and verifies the outcome using multiple sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds through the necessary steps to determine the outcome of the event. It checks the date to confirm the event has occurred, searches for the outcome, and verifies this outcome with multiple sources. The reasoning is clear, and the response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for Cal Irvine's win) directly with the verified outcome of the event, adhering to the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907941 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:05:41 UTC"
