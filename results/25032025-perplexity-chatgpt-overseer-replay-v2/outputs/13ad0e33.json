        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"China\" during his Kennedy Center board meeting on March 17, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the word \"China\" during that event. Let's go through the sources one by one. \n\nLooking at source [1], it's a detailed account of the event. Trump mentions the Kennedy Center being in disrepair and talks about management issues, but there's no mention of \"China\" here. The article is from KNKX and covers his tour and board meeting, but no reference to China.\n\nSource [4] from CBS News discusses the meeting setup and costs but doesn't mention Trump's remarks about China. Similarly, source [5] from Business Standard talks about Trump's visit and his plans for the center but again, no mention of China.\n\nSource [6] is a YouTube video summary where Trump pledges changes at the center. The transcript in source [12] from the YouTube video includes Trump's remarks during the event. Let me check that. The transcript has Trump talking about disrepair, costs with unions, and plans to fix things. He mentions Lee Greenwood and a piano moving cost, but no mention of \"China\" here either.\n\nSource [10] from NY1 quotes Trump discussing the center's condition and future plans, including releasing documents related to JFK's assassination. Still no mention of China. Source [11] mentions Trump's critique of the center's expansion but again, no China reference.\n\nOther sources like [2] and [14] discuss Trump's policies towards China in different contexts, but those are from February and 2017, not related to the March 17 event. Source [7] talks about leaked audio from a previous meeting where Trump discusses the center's direction, but that's from February, not the March event.\n\nThe key here is that none of the sources reporting on the March 17 event mention Trump saying \"China.\" The transcripts available from the event (source [12]) don't include the word. Since the resolution depends on video evidence and the provided search results don't indicate any usage of \"China\" during that specific appearance, the answer should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump attended the Kennedy Center board meeting on March 17, 2025, where he criticized the institution's management and physical condition. During his remarks to reporters and the board, he focused on perceived disrepair, union-related costs, and plans to revitalize the center[1][4][10][12]. Multiple transcripts and reports from the event show Trump discussed topics including:\n\n- The Kennedy Center's $250 million underground expansion, which he called wasteful[12]\n- Union fees for moving a piano ($30,000)[12]\n- Plans to improve the venue's infrastructure[10][11]\n- Upcoming releases of JFK assassination documents[10]\n\n**Key Analysis:**  \nNo sources mention Trump using the word \"China\" during this specific March 17 appearance. While some search results discuss Trump's broader China policy[2][14], these references predate the Kennedy Center event and aren't part of his remarks during the board meeting or related Q&A sessions. The leaked February audio[7] and February leadership changes[8][9] also contain no relevant mentions.\n\n**Resolution:**  \nBased on available video transcripts[12] and event coverage[1][4][5][10][11], Trump did not utter the word \"China\" during the March 17 Kennedy Center board meeting or associated Q&A sessions.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923059 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:17:39 UTC",
