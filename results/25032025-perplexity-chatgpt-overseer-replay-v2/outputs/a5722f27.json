        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Air Force vs. UNLV college basketball game that was scheduled for March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Air Force wins, the market resolves to \"Air Force\" (p2), if UNLV wins, it resolves to \"UNLV\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the date of the event. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 12, so the event should have already occurred. Next, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources mention the game. Source [1] is an article from the Air Force Falcons' official website titled \"Air Force Falls To UNLV At Credit Union 1 Mountain West Men's Basketball Championships\" dated March 12, 2025. It states that Air Force lost 68-58 to UNLV. Source [4] from ESPN also reports a final score of UNLV 68-59 over Air Force on the same date. Another source [6] from Franchise Sports Media describes UNLV's 68-59 victory, highlighting key players and the game's context. \n\nThere's a slight discrepancy in the scores between sources [1] and [4]/[6], but all agree that UNLV won. The exact score might be a typo in one of the articles, but the consensus is clear: UNLV was the victor. Additionally, source [7] from Vegas Insider lists the March 12 game result as a 68-59 UNLV win, aligning with ESPN and Franchise Sports Media. \n\nSince the game took place as scheduled and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the sources, the resolution should be based on the outcome. All credible sources confirm UNLV's win, so the market should resolve to p1 (UNLV). There's no indication of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Air Force Falcons faced the UNLV Runnin' Rebels in the first round of the 2025 Mountain West Men\u2019s Basketball Championships on March 12, 2025, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. **UNLV won the game 68-59**[1][4][6], overcoming an early deficit with a decisive 19-0 run in the second half. Key contributions came from UNLV\u2019s Jalen Hill (18 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists) and Air Force\u2019s Ethan Taylor (23 points, 7 three-pointers)[1][6]. The game proceeded as scheduled, with no reports of postponement or cancellation.  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **UNLV** (p1), as they secured the victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Verification of Event**: The response accurately identifies that the Air Force vs. UNLV game occurred on March 12, 2025, and that UNLV won the game. The response cross-references multiple sources to confirm the outcome, which enhances the reliability of the information provided.\n\n2. **Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions by confirming the event has already occurred (since the current date is March 25, 2025) and by providing a resolution based on the outcome of the event as specified in the user prompt. The response correctly identifies that the event is not a future event and thus does not default to p4 unnecessarily.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data, correctly mapping the outcome of the game to the resolution condition (p1 for a UNLV win). It also checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which are not present, thus correctly applying the resolution condition.\n\n4. **Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 (UNLV) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game. The response ensures that the resolution recommendation corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n5. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The slight discrepancy in the game's final score between sources is acknowledged, but it does not affect the overall outcome of the game or the resolution of the market.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and logically processes the information to provide a correct resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event outcome and checks for any discrepancies or issues that might affect the resolution.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
