        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"China\" three or more times during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"China\" in his speech, considering pluralization and possessive forms but not other variations. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he said it three or more times, otherwise \"No\" (p1). \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of Trump's speech and any direct quotes or transcripts. The key sources here are the transcripts and detailed summaries of his speech. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [14] provides a transcript of Trump's speech. In the transcript, he says, \"It\u2019s high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing rather than taking it away,\" but there's no mention of \"China\" here. \n\nAnother source, [1], mentions Trump highlighting concerns about foreign countries, particularly China, making advancements in blockchain. However, this is part of the article's summary, not a direct quote from the speech. Similarly, source [16] includes a hashtag comment stating, \"He highlighted concerns about foreign countries, particularly China...\" but again, this is a third-party summary, not a direct quote from the speech transcript.\n\nSource [15] provides the full translated text of Trump's speech. The translated transcript does not include the word \"China.\" The speech focuses on the U.S. leading in crypto, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and ending previous regulatory practices. There's no mention of China in the actual speech content provided here.\n\nOther sources like [3], [5], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], and [17] discuss the content of Trump's speech, including his emphasis on U.S. leadership, regulatory changes, and the Bitcoin reserve, but none of these mention Trump using the word \"China\" during his address. \n\nThe user's query specifies that any usage of the term \"China\" in the speech counts, but according to the available transcripts and summaries, Trump did not mention China during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit. The mentions of China in some articles are part of the authors' analyses or summaries, not direct quotes from the speech itself. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions require the count to be based on the actual speech video. Since the transcript from the speech (source [14] and [15]) does not include the word \"China,\" and no other sources provide direct evidence of Trump saying \"China\" during the speech, the count is zero. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The updates mention that the video address counts, but without any instances of \"China\" in the speech, the answer remains \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, did **not** include any instances of the word \"China\" based on available transcripts and verified sources[14][15]. While third-party analyses mentioned China in their summaries of broader geopolitical crypto competition[1][16], these references were not part of Trump's actual speech content. The full transcript shows his remarks focused exclusively on domestic crypto policy, Bitcoin reserves, and regulatory reforms without mentioning foreign nations[14][15].\n\nPer the resolution conditions requiring direct evidence from the speech itself, the term \"China\" did not appear in any form (including plural/possessive) during Trump's address. This meets the criteria for resolution **p1 (No)**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be thorough and well-aligned with the requirements of the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the user prompt's instructions by focusing on the specific event (Donald Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025) and the specific term (\"China\") mentioned in the prompt. The response correctly identifies that the resolution should be based on direct quotes from the speech rather than summaries or third-party interpretations. The sources cited ([14] and [15]) are used to confirm that the term \"China\" was not mentioned in the speech, which aligns with the resolution conditions that require direct evidence from the speech itself.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the relevant sources for any mention of the term \"China\" and clearly distinguishes between direct quotes and third-party summaries. It correctly concludes that since the term was not mentioned in the speech, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The reasoning is logical, follows the prompt's requirements, and is supported by evidence from the sources.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and uses the correct date and context for the analysis. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) is based on the absence of the term \"China\" in the speech, which is confirmed by the transcripts provided in the sources. This is in full alignment with the facts and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the required elements from the user prompt and does not introduce irrelevant information or assumptions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is accurate, complete, and adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It provides a clear and well-supported recommendation based on the evidence available from the specified sources.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzes the event based on the specified sources, adheres to the resolution conditions, and provides a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm the absence of the term 'China' in Trump's speech and logically concludes the market resolution based on this evidence.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742919315 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:15:15 UTC",
