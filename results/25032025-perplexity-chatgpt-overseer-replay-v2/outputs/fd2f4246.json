        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Traditional\" during his Kennedy Center board meeting on March 17, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he used that specific term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of Trump's statements during that event. The key sources here are the transcripts and reports from the event. Let's look through the relevant search results.\n\nLooking at source [12], which is a transcript from the Kennedy Center board meeting on March 17, 2025. The transcript snippet shows Trump talking about the physical state of the Kennedy Center, mentioning things like fixing up the building, graffiti, and making the country great again. The exact quote from the transcript is: \"we're going to spend a lot of a lot of effort a lot of money on crime and we're going to spend it on fixing up we don't want graffiti on the beautiful white statuary marble and we want to have our roads good and everything else we'll be able to do that easily and this is a part of it I mean Kennedy Center is a very big part of it...\" There's no mention of the word \"Traditional\" here.\n\nSource [14] mentions Trump's visit, where he criticized the center's design and spending, and talked about fixing it up. He also mentioned \"woke\" shows but didn't use \"Traditional\". Source [17] includes Trump's statement about the Kennedy Center being an \"American Jewel\" and stopping drag shows, but again, \"Traditional\" isn't used. \n\nSource [19] quotes Trump saying the Kennedy Center is in \"tremendous disrepair\" and mentions bad management, but no \"Traditional\". Source [7] has a video transcript where Trump talks about making changes to the Kennedy Center, including seats and decor, but again, the term isn't present.\n\nNone of the provided sources show Trump using the word \"Traditional\" during the event. The ancillary data specifies that any usage of the term, including in Q&A, counts. However, the transcripts available don't include any Q&A sessions, and the main remarks don't have the word. Since the event occurred on March 17 and the current date is March 25, 2025, there's no indication the event was canceled or unaired. \n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, Trump did not say \"Traditional\" during the Kennedy Center event. The market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on Trump's usage of the term during the event, including any Q&A sessions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by examining multiple sources, including transcripts and video transcripts, to determine whether Trump used the specified term. The AI's approach to checking various sources for the mention of the word \"Traditional\" is thorough and aligns with the requirements of the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place on the specified date and that it was not canceled or unaired. The AI correctly concludes that Trump did not use the word \"Traditional\" based on the evidence available from the event's transcripts and other sources. This conclusion is well-supported by the data provided and aligns with the ancillary data's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There is no apparent bias or errors in the response. The AI has effectively used the provided sources to make an informed decision. However, it is noted that the response does not explicitly mention checking for Q&A sessions beyond what is available in the transcripts. This could be a point of improvement, ensuring that all parts of the event were thoroughly reviewed if additional data were available.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It accurately follows the instructions, uses logical reasoning, verifies the event appropriately, and aligns the recommendation with the established facts without any evident bias or significant errors.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, logically analyzes the available sources, verifies the event occurrence, and aligns the recommendation with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-reasoned. However, it could further clarify if all potential sources, such as additional Q&A sessions, were reviewed if available beyond the main transcripts.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
