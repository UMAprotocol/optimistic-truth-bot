        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" based on whether Russia and Ukraine had an official ceasefire agreement by March 21, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any official announcements or credible media reports confirming a ceasefire by that date. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [1] from March 21 mentions that Zelenskyy and Putin agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire, but implementation is still a work in progress. The article says they agreed after Trump's intervention, but there are discrepancies in what's covered\u2014Ukraine wants railways and ports included, while Russia mentions only energy infrastructure. The Kremlin also accuses Ukraine of not upholding their end. So, there's an agreement in principle, but it's not fully implemented and there's no mutual announcement. \n\nResult [9] from March 25 states that Ukraine announced implementing a partial ceasefire immediately following the US announcement, but the Kremlin notes it's a 30-day period starting March 18. However, the agreement lacks specifics on violations. The White House confirms the ban on striking energy facilities. But the key here is the date\u2014March 25 is after the deadline of March 21. \n\nResult [10] from March 12 mentions Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US, contingent on Russia's agreement. But as of March 12, Russia hadn't agreed. Result [11] from March 23 indicates the US aimed for a truce by April 20, which is after the March 21 deadline. \n\nOther sources like [2], [5], [7], and [8] discuss ongoing talks in Saudi Arabia post-March 21, with joint statements expected after March 21. For example, result [2] from March 25 says Russia and Ukraine agreed to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea, but this is part of ongoing negotiations after the deadline. \n\nCrucially, the deadline was March 21. The agreement in principle mentioned in [1] on March 21 doesn't meet the criteria of an official, mutually announced ceasefire. The subsequent developments on March 24-25 are after the deadline, so they don't count. There's no credible media consensus reporting an official agreement by March 21. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's resolution conditions have p2 as Yes and p1 as No. Wait, checking the resolution_conditions: p1:0 is No, p2:1 is Yes. Wait, the user wrote \"res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes...\" So if the answer is No, it's p1. But according to the data, there was an agreement in principle on March 21, but it's limited and not fully implemented. The market requires an official ceasefire agreement by March 21. The sources indicate that while there was an agreement in principle, it wasn't officially finalized or mutually announced with all terms settled by the deadline. Therefore, the resolution should be p1 (No). But wait, result [9] says Ukraine announced implementation on March 25, which is after the deadline. So by March 21, there was no official agreement. Hence, the answer is p1: No.\n</think>\n\nThe market question asks whether an official ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine was reached by March 21, 2025, based on mutual public announcements or credible media consensus.  \n\nOn March 21, 2025, Russia and Ukraine agreed **in principle** to a limited ceasefire focused on halting strikes on energy infrastructure, following U.S.-mediated talks[1][7]. However, discrepancies persisted:  \n- The Kremlin insisted the deal covered only energy infrastructure, while Ukraine sought broader protections for railways and ports[1][8].  \n- Both sides accused each other of violating the tentative terms, with Russia claiming Ukraine attacked a gas metering station and Ukraine denying responsibility[1][7].  \n\nWhile the White House described this as a \"movement to peace,\" **no finalized, mutually announced agreement** was confirmed by the March 21 deadline. Technical discussions continued in Saudi Arabia through March 24\u201325[2][5][9], and Ukraine unilaterally announced a partial ceasefire implementation on March 25[9], four days after the resolution cutoff.  \n\n**Key considerations**:  \n1. The March 21 agreement remained provisional, with unresolved disputes over scope and enforcement[1][7].  \n2. No joint statement or ratified terms were published by the deadline.  \n3. Subsequent negotiations and Ukraine\u2019s March 25 announcement occurred after the market\u2019s resolution date.  \n\nSince the criteria require an official, mutually recognized ceasefire by March 21, 2025, and none met this standard, the market resolves to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926275 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:11:15 UTC",
