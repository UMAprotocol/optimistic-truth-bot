        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she uses either term, regardless of context, with plural or possessive forms counting, but other variations not. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and \"p3\" if uncertain. The deadline is December 31, 2025, and if she's no longer press secretary by then, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a recent press briefing after March 26, 2025. The current date given is March 26, 2025. The search results include briefings up to March 20-21, 2025. The latest mentioned is on March 20, where she discussed the JFK files release. In those briefings, she used \"JFK\" multiple times, as seen in sources [1], [2], [3], [6], [7], and [12]. For example, in the March 20 briefing, she mentioned \"JFK assassination files\" and \"JFK\" explicitly. \n\nHowever, the query is about the *next* briefing after March 26. Since the current date is March 26, 2025, the next briefing would be after this date. The search results don't include any briefings beyond March 21. Therefore, there's no information available yet on whether she used the terms in a briefing after March 26. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But since the user is asking about the next briefing, and we don't have data on briefings after March 26, we can't confirm if she used the terms. However, based on her history, she frequently uses \"JFK\" when discussing the released files. If the next briefing is about ongoing issues related to the JFK files, she might use the term again. But without confirmation, it's uncertain.\n\nWait, but the user's query is about the next briefing she participates in. Since the current date is March 26, and the latest briefing in the search results is March 21, the next one would be after March 26. Since there's no information on that yet, and the resolution source is the video/transcript of that specific briefing, which isn't available in the provided search results, we can't definitively say she did or didn't. However, the market resolves based on whether the event has occurred by the deadline. Since the deadline is December 31, 2025, and the current date is March 26, 2025, the event (the next briefing) hasn't happened yet. Therefore, the market can't be resolved yet and should resolve to p4. Wait, no\u2014the user's ancillary data says if the event is in the future, resolve to p4. But the current timestamp is March 26, 2025, and the next briefing is after that. Since the event hasn't occurred yet, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's query is about whether she will say it in the next briefing. But according to the rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, resolve to p4. But the market's resolution is based on whether she says it in the next briefing, which hasn't happened yet. Therefore, the answer should be p4. But wait, the market's resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, not all possible ones. However, the query is about whether she will say it in the next briefing she participates in. Since the next briefing is in the future relative to March 26, 2025, the event hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, according to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the market's resolution is based on the occurrence by the deadline. Wait, the market's deadline is December 31, 2025. So if the next briefing happens after March 26 but before the deadline, and she says the terms, it's \"Yes\". If she doesn't have any more briefings by the deadline, it's \"No\". But the user is asking to resolve based on the current information. However, the provided search results don't include any briefings after March 26. Therefore, as of the current date (March 26, 2025), the next briefing hasn't occurred yet. Since the event is in the future, the resolution should be p4. But the user's query is about resolving based on the current information. Wait, the user is asking to resolve the market now, based on the available information. But according to the rules, if the event is in the future, resolve to p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that since the event has not yet occurred, it cannot be resolved based on past or current information and thus recommends resolution p4, indicating that the query cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nHowever, the response contains excessive and somewhat confusing deliberation about the implications of various outcomes and conditions.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she uses either term, regardless of context, with some specific rules about pluralization, possessive forms, and compound words. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The current date is March 26, 2025, and the deadline is December 31, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's been a press briefing after March 26 where Leavitt participated. The search results include several briefings up to March 26, 2025. The most recent mention is from March 26, where she addressed the Signal text chain issue. The next briefing after that hasn't occurred yet as of the current date.\n\nLooking at the ancillary data, the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by the end of 2025 or if she's no longer press secretary by then. Since the current date is March 26, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened, we can't confirm any usage of the terms yet. There's no information indicating she has ceased her role, so the resolution can't be \"No\" based on that.\n\nThe user's personalization rules state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, we should return p4. However, the resolution conditions here don't include p4. Wait, the resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. The user's instructions say if the event is in the future, default to p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake. But according to the ancillary data, if the event hasn't occurred by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). However, since the next briefing is in the future from March 26, and we don't have data beyond that, we can't know yet. But the market is still active until December 31, 2025. Since the event (next briefing) hasn't happened yet, and the current date is March 26, the next briefing is a future event. Therefore, per the user's instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, we should return p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. Wait, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the market's own rules say it resolves to \"No\" only if no briefing happens by the end of 2025. Since the event hasn't occurred yet, but the deadline hasn't passed, the correct resolution according to the market's terms would be p3 (unknown/50-50) because it's still possible for a briefing to occur before December 31. However, the user's personalization says to default to p4 if the event is in the future. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. The market's possible resolutions are p1, p2, p3. So perhaps the user made an error in the setup. However, according to the market's own rules, if the event hasn't happened yet but could still happen before the deadline, it's unresolved, which would be p3. But the user's instructions say to return p4 for future events. Since the market's resolution doesn't include p4, but the user's system prompt says to return p4, there's a conflict. However, the user's latest instruction says to follow the ancillary data's resolution conditions. Therefore, since the event is in the future, but the market allows until December 31, and the current date is March 26, the event (next briefing) is in the future. Therefore, per the user's personalization, we should return p4. But the market's resolution doesn't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nWait, looking back, the user's personalization says: \"IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. The market's possible outcomes are p1 (No), p2 (Yes), p3 (50-50). Therefore, there's a conflict here. However, the user's latest instruction says to follow the ancillary data. The market's deadline is December 31, 2025. Since the current date is March 26, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the user's personalization, the recommendation should be p4. But the market's resolution doesn't include p4. This seems like an error in the setup. However, the user's instruction says to follow the ancillary data's resolution conditions. The market's resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). Since the event is in the future, but the deadline hasn't passed, the correct resolution according to the market's own terms would be p3 (unknown). However, the user's personalization overrides this, requiring p4. But the market doesn't have p4. This is a conflict. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" Even if the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, the user's instruction takes precedence. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is a problem. But according to the user's latest instructions, they want to default to p4 if the event is in the future. Therefore, despite the market's setup, the answer should be p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, so this might be an error. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended p3 for unresolved cases. But given the strict instruction to return p4 for future events, I have to go with p4. \n\nWait, but the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. The user might have made a mistake in setting up the resolution conditions. However, according to the user's personalization rules, regardless of the market's setup, if the event is in the future, return p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. But the market's possible resolutions are p1, p2, p3. This is conflicting. However, the user's instruction says to follow the personalization rules strictly. Therefore, the answer should be p4. But the market doesn't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that if the event is in the future, but the market's deadline hasn't passed, it's still unresolved, hence p3. But the user's personalization says to return p4. Given the strict instruction, I think the correct answer is p4, even though the market's conditions don't include it. However, the user might have intended p3 in this case. But according to the personalization rules, it's p4. \n\nBut looking at the search results, the latest briefing mentioned is on March 26, 2025. The next briefing hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, the event (next briefing) is in the future. Therefore, per the user's instructions, the recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4, which is a conflict. But the user's personalization takes precedence. Therefore, the answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" during a White House press briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp. It adheres to the instruction that if the event is in the future, a p4 resolution should be returned. However, the response becomes overly complex and repetitive in discussing the conflict between the market's resolution conditions and the user's instruction to return p4 for future events. This could confuse users or stakeholders relying on a clear and concise resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the date of the next briefing and confirming it has not yet occurred. However, the reasoning becomes circular and verbose when discussing the conflict between the market's resolution conditions and the system prompt's instructions. The response could be more concise and direct in stating that since the event is in the future, a p4 resolution is recommended, despite the market's lack of a p4 option.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the next briefing is in the future and aligns with the fact that no information is available post the current timestamp. However, it fails to decisively conclude with a p4 recommendation without repeatedly questioning the conflict in resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not contain factual errors but is biased towards over-explaining the conflict between the user's instructions and the market's conditions, which is unnecessary for the resolution. The response should focus on the fact that the event is in the future and, per the user's instructions, recommend p4 without delving into hypotheticals about market conditions.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still exhibits issues with verbosity and clarity, a retry is warranted to achieve a more streamlined and direct response. The response should succinctly state that the event is in the future, no information is available beyond the current timestamp, and therefore, a p4 resolution is recommended, adhering strictly to the user's instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response is overly verbose and confusing, lacking clarity and directness needed for stakeholders to make informed decisions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should be more concise, directly addressing the key points relevant to the system prompt instructions without redundant deliberation or questioning of the conflict between market conditions and user instructions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please provide a direct and concise analysis, focusing on the key aspects of the user prompt and ancillary data.

        "attempt": 3,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" during her next White House press briefing. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if she doesn't, and p3 if it's uncertain. The current date is March 26, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any upcoming briefing scheduled. The search results mention briefings up to March 20, 2025, like the one on March 19 and 20. The latest transcript is from March 19, and there's a mention of a press conference on March 26 at 4:00 PM in result [15], but it's about tariffs, not a briefing. The user's current time is 7:13 PM UTC on March 26, so if the 4 PM briefing already occurred, we need to check if she said the terms. However, the search results don't include transcripts or videos from March 26 yet. \n\nLooking at past behavior, Leavitt frequently discussed JFK files in briefings around March 19-20, using both \"John F. Kennedy\" and \"JFK\" (sources [1], [3], [9], [12], [13]). For example, in the March 19 briefing, she mentioned \"John F. Kennedy\" and \"JFK\" multiple times. However, the next briefing after March 20 hasn't been documented in the provided sources. \n\nSince the next briefing after March 20 hasn't occurred yet (as of the current date in the query), and there's no information about her ceasing to be press secretary, the event is in the future. According to the rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, the resolution should be p4. Wait, but the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the user's ancillary data specifies p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the system prompt says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the user's resolution conditions don't include p4. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion here.\n\nWait, the system prompt says: \"IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the user's resolution conditions don't have p4. The ancillary data defines p1, p2, p3. So perhaps the user's market is designed to resolve based on whether the event has already happened, but the current timestamp is March 26, 2025, 7:13 PM UTC, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet. Therefore, since the event (next briefing) is in the future, per the system instructions, we should return p4. However, the user's resolution conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. \n\nWait, looking back at the user's query, the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025. But the current date is March 26, 2025, so the next briefing is in the future. Since the event hasn't occurred yet, and there's no information post-current timestamp, the correct resolution is p4. But the user's ancillary data doesn't have p4. The system prompt says to default to p4 if the event is in the future. However, the user's resolution conditions only have p1, p2, p3. This might be an error in the setup, but according to the instructions, we must follow the system's rules. Therefore, despite the user's ancillary data, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's market might not account for p4, so perhaps the answer should be p4 regardless. \n\nBut the user's query says if the event hasn't happened by Dec 31, 2025, resolve to No (p1). But the current date is March 26, 2025, so the next briefing could still happen before Dec 31. Since the next briefing is in the future and hasn't occurred yet, and there's no information available post the current timestamp, the resolution should be p4. However, the system prompt says to return p4 in such cases. But the user's market doesn't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, the system prompt says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" So regardless of the user's resolution conditions, per the system's rules, we must return p4. However, the user's ancillary data doesn't include p4. This might be a setup error, but according to the instructions, we must follow the system's rules. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut the user's query says the resolution is based on whether the term is said in the next briefing. Since the next briefing is in the future and hasn't happened yet, and there's no information, the answer is p4. However, the user's market might not have p4, but the system's instructions take precedence. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe query concerns whether Karoline Leavitt will use the terms \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" during her next White House press briefing. The current timestamp is **March 26, 2025, 7:13:30 PM UTC**, and the next briefing has not yet occurred.  \n\n### Key Analysis:  \n1. **Event Timing**:  \n   - The \"next White House press briefing\" referenced in the query is a future event relative to the current timestamp.  \n   - No transcripts, video evidence, or verified reports exist for any briefing occurring after March 26, 2025, at 7:13 PM UTC.  \n\n2. **Historical Context**:  \n   - Leavitt frequently referenced \"John F. Kennedy\" and \"JFK\" in briefings between March 17\u201320, 2025, while discussing the release of classified JFK assassination files[1][3][9][12][13].  \n   - However, past usage does not guarantee future repetition, and no confirmed schedule for her next briefing is provided in the search results.  \n\n3. **Resolution Conditions**:  \n   - The market resolves to \"No\" (p1) only if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, or if Leavitt ceases to be press secretary. Neither condition is met as of the current timestamp.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nSince the event in question (the next press briefing) is scheduled for a future date/time relative to the current timestamp, and no post-March 26, 2025, information is available, the resolution defaults to **p4** (insufficient data to resolve definitively).  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths but also exhibits critical issues that need addressing:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question, Karoline Leavitt's mention of \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" during the next White House press briefing, is a future event relative to the current timestamp. This aligns with the system prompt's instruction to check if the event is scheduled for a future date or time. The response also correctly identifies that no information is available post the current timestamp, leading to a p4 resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed analysis of past events where Leavitt mentioned \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK,\" which is useful for understanding the context but not directly relevant to resolving the query since the event is in the future. The response correctly concludes that since the event is in the future and no information is available post the current timestamp, the resolution defaults to p4. However, the response is overly verbose and somewhat repetitive in explaining the rationale for p4, which could be streamlined for clarity and conciseness.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the next briefing has not occurred yet as of the current timestamp and aligns the recommendation (p4) with this fact. However, the response could improve by more directly stating that the lack of available information for any event post-March 26, 2025, necessitates a p4 resolution without the extended deliberation on past briefings.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not contain factual errors but does exhibit a redundancy in explaining the rationale for the p4 recommendation. The response could benefit from a more streamlined explanation that focuses solely on the lack of available information for the future event and the system prompt's directive to return p4 in such cases.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response still shows verbosity and redundancy, a retry could be beneficial to achieve a more concise and direct explanation. However, since the core factual content and the final recommendation of p4 are correct, a retry might not necessarily change the outcome but could improve the presentation and clarity of the response.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the event as future and correctly applies the p4 resolution based on the lack of available information post-current timestamp.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015983 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:06:23 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease provide a more direct and concise analysis, focusing on the key aspects of the user prompt and ancillary data without redundant deliberation. Clearly state that the event is in the future and no information is available post the current timestamp, leading to a p4 resolution.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response correctly identifies the need for a p4 resolution but is overly verbose and somewhat confusing. It should more succinctly and directly address the key points relevant to the system prompt instructions.\n\n1. Dig deeper into available sources and data\n2. Be more critical of potentially unreliable sources\n3. Consider all interpretations of the query\n4. Provide more specific evidence for your recommendation\n5. Make sure your recommendation is fully justified by your analysis\n\nTry your best to find information that would lead to a definitive answer (p1/p2/p3) if possible, before defaulting to p4.\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease provide a direct and concise analysis, focusing on the key aspects of the user prompt and ancillary data. Clearly state that the event is in the future and no information is available post the current timestamp, leading to a p4 resolution. Avoid over-explaining or questioning the setup of the market's resolution conditions."
