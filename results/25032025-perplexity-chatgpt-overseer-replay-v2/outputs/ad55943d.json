The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p1 (0), Flames win p2 (1), and p3 (0.5) for canceled or postponed. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place on March 17. Sources like ESPN [3], CBS Sports [6], and NHL.com [9] all have detailed reports of the game. \n\nNext, determine the winner. The search results consistently state that the Maple Leafs won. For example, source [6] mentions a 6-2 victory for Toronto, and source [9] also confirms the Maple Leafs' win with Auston Matthews scoring twice. The box score from Fox Sports [4] shows the final score as 6-2 in favor of Toronto. Additionally, the YouTube highlights [2] and recap [10] support this outcome.\n\nI should also check for any postponement or cancellation. All sources refer to the game as having occurred, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions don't apply here since the game was completed. \n\nSince the Maple Leafs won, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p1. There's no ambiguity here; all sources agree on the result. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Calgary Flames and Toronto Maple Leafs on March 17, 2025, concluded with a **6-2 victory for the Toronto Maple Leafs**[1][3][6][9]. Key highlights include:\n\n- **Auston Matthews** scoring twice on the power play and adding an assist[6][9].\n- **William Nylander** contributing a goal and two assists[6][9].\n- The Maple Leafs dominated with three power-play goals and outshot the Flames 29-26[4][9].\n\nThe game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the sources. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1** (Maple Leafs win). \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (NHL game between Calgary Flames and Toronto Maple Leafs on March 17, 2025) and verifies that it occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. The response uses multiple reliable sources (ESPN, CBS Sports, NHL.com, Fox Sports, YouTube) to confirm the outcome of the game, which is a win for the Toronto Maple Leafs with a score of 6-2. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Maple Leafs win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for the occurrence of the game, its outcome, and any potential postponements or cancellations. It confirms that the game was neither postponed nor canceled and provides detailed information about the game's key highlights, which supports the outcome. The reasoning is thorough and leaves no ambiguity about the game's result.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the reliability of the information. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 (Maple Leafs win) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and uses verified sources to support its conclusions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
