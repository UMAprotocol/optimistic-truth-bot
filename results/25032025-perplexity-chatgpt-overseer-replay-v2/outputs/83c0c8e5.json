        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Virginia vs. Georgia Tech CBB game scheduled for March 12 at 12:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Georgia Tech wins, it's p1; Virginia wins, p2; postponed stays open; canceled resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] is from the ACC website dated March 12, 2025, stating Georgia Tech beat Virginia 66-60 in the ACC Tournament second round. That's the exact date mentioned in the query. The detailed report confirms the score, the teams, and the outcome. \n\nResult [6] from Virginia's sports site also confirms the loss to Georgia Tech on March 12, 2025, with the same score. Result [3] from SI.com and [7] from RamblinWreck.com both corroborate the Georgia Tech victory. \n\nThere's a potential confusion with results [2] and [4], which mention a canceled game in 2021. But those are from 2021, so irrelevant here. The 2025 game wasn't canceled. \n\nThe YouTube video [5] is from February 8, 2025, a regular-season game where Virginia won, but the query is about March 12. \n\nAll recent and relevant sources confirm Georgia Tech won on March 12, 2025. No mentions of postponement or cancellation for that date. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Georgia Tech).\n</think>\n\nGeorgia Tech defeated Virginia 66-60 in the ACC Men's Basketball Tournament second round on March 12, 2025, as scheduled. The game was not postponed or canceled, with Georgia Tech securing the victory through strong performances from Duncan Powell (21 points), Baye Ndongo (16 points, 10 rebounds), and Naithan George (13 points, 10 rebounds, 8 assists). Isaac McKneely led Virginia with 27 points, but the Cavaliers couldn't overcome Georgia Tech's dominance in rebounding (44-26 advantage) and points in the paint (40-24)[1][6][7].\n\nKey factors in the outcome:\n- **Second-half surge**: Georgia Tech shot 50% after halftime while holding Virginia to 36.2% overall shooting[1][6]\n- **Defensive rebounding**: The Yellow Jackets allowed only 4 second-chance points[1][7]\n- **Clutch free throws**: Naithan George made four critical free throws in the final 25 seconds to seal the win[1][7]\n\nThe game concluded as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations reported[1][6][7]. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market should resolve to Georgia Tech's victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905200 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:20:00 UTC"
