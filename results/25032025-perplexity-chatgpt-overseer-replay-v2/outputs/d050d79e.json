        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a prediction market based on the outcome of the Drake vs. Missouri NCAA Tournament game played on March 20, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Drake wins, the market resolves to p2; if Missouri wins, p1; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the scheduled game date. Looking at the search results, several sources confirm the game was played. For example, result [14] from trumanstales.com states Missouri lost to Drake 67-57. Result [15] from godrakebulldogs.com also reports Drake's victory with the same score. ESPN's recap [16] and box score [18] corroborate the 67-57 score in favor of Drake. Additionally, the YouTube video [19] and SI.com article [20] mention the loss and post-game reactions.\n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. The search results don't mention any postponement or cancellation. Instead, they all discuss the game's outcome, indicating it was played as scheduled. Sources like [3] and [5] discuss game changes and cancellations in other contexts (like COVID-19 in 2020), but there's no indication of such issues for this 2025 game.\n\nSince the game was played and Drake won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. There's no ambiguity here as multiple credible sources confirm Drake's victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament game between the No. 11 seed Drake Bulldogs and No. 6 seed Missouri Tigers occurred as scheduled on **March 20, 2025**, with Drake securing a **67-57 victory**[14][15][16]. The Bulldogs led by as many as 15 points in the second half before Missouri narrowed the gap to two points late, but Drake closed strong behind Bennett Stirtz's 21-point performance and suffocating defense that held Missouri to **33.3% shooting**[14][16]. \n\nKey factors in the outcome:\n- **Drake's defensive dominance**: Ranked #1 nationally in scoring defense (58.4 PPG), they forced 17 turnovers and limited Missouri to 4/16 from three-point range[14][16].\n- **Missouri's offensive struggles**: Only two Tigers scored in double figures (Caleb Grill: 14, Tamar Bates: 10), and the team shot 15/45 overall[14][18].\n- **Tempo control**: Drake's methodical pace (slowest in Division I) disrupted Missouri's high-scoring offense (84.5 PPG)[7][16].\n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation, and no subsequent rescheduling occurred. Based on the resolution conditions provided:\n- **Drake's win** directly triggers **p2** resolution.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

This outcome is verified through multiple credible sources, including trumanstales.com, godrakebulldogs.com, ESPN, and SI.com. The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event occurred as scheduled and was neither postponed nor canceled.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first verifying the occurrence of the event and then confirming the outcome. It correctly applies the ancillary data conditions by recommending a resolution of p2 based on Drake's victory. The response also provides a detailed analysis of the game, which, while not necessary for the resolution, adds depth and confirms the thoroughness of the source verification.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the verified outcome of the game. This is in line with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
