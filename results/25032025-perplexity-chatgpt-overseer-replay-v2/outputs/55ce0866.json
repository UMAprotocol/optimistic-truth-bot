The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Boise State vs. New Mexico men's basketball game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Boise State wins, the market resolves to \"Boise State\" (p2), if New Mexico wins, it resolves to \"New Mexico\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14, so the event should have taken place. Let me look through the search results to confirm the game's outcome. \n\nSearch result [4] is a CBS Sports recap titled \"Degenhart and Boise State knock off top-seed New Mexico in MWC Tournament semifinals 72-69.\" The final score here is Boise State 72, New Mexico 69. That's a direct indication that Boise State won. \n\nResult [5] is a YouTube video highlighting Boise State's 72-69 win over New Mexico in the semifinals, which supports the same outcome. \n\nResult [7] from the University of New Mexico's athletics site states that the Lobos were edged by Boise State 72-69 in the Mountain West semifinals. \n\nResult [9] from the Mountain West Conference's official site confirms the upset, with Boise State winning 72-69. \n\nESPN's recap in result [10] and [13] both list the final score as 72-69 in favor of Boise State. Additionally, result [12] from Boise State's athletics site mentions Degenhart breaking the scoring record and leading the Broncos to a 72-69 victory. \n\nAll these sources consistently report that Boise State won the game. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The user's resolution conditions state that a Boise State win should resolve to p2. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Boise State Broncos defeated the New Mexico Lobos 72-69 in the Mountain West Conference Tournament semifinals on March 14, 2025. This outcome was verified across multiple sources, including official game recaps from both universities[1][4][7][9][12], ESPN[10], and the Mountain West Conference[9]. Key details:\n\n- **Final score**: Boise State 72, New Mexico 69[4][10][12]\n- **Game context**: A conference tournament semifinal matchup at Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas[7][9]\n- **Deciding play**: Andrew Meadow's go-ahead 3-pointer with 46 seconds remaining sealed the victory for Boise State[9][12]\n- **Standings impact**: The loss ended New Mexico's four-game winning streak[12], while Boise State advanced to its first MW championship game since 2022[9]\n\nNo evidence suggests postponement or cancellation \u2013 the game concluded as scheduled. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **Boise State (p2)** as they won the contest.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The details provided about the game's score, context, and key plays are consistent across these sources, confirming Boise State's victory.\n\n2. **Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions by confirming the event occurred as scheduled and by not predicting outcomes or using unverified sources. It correctly identifies that the event is in the past and verifies the outcome based on reliable sources.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources to conclude that Boise State won the game. It includes sufficient details about the game to support its conclusion, such as the final score, game context, and key plays, which align with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Boise State\" (p2) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which states that a Boise State win should resolve to p2. The response correctly applies this condition based on the verified game outcome.\n\n5. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on verified facts and avoids assumptions or predictions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907190 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:53:10 UTC"
