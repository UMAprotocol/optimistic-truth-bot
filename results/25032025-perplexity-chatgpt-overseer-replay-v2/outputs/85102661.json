        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Weaponization\" during his DOJ speech on March 14, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he used the exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The resolution source is the video of the speech.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the word \"weaponization\" during that event. Let's go through the sources.\n\nLooking at source [1], the article mentions Trump's speech at the DOJ. It quotes him saying, \"We're turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization ... The look is so important.\" Here, he uses \"weaponization\" directly. That's a clear instance.\n\nSource [8] from Politico reports Trump's speech where he said, \"They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies...\" The term here is \"weaponized,\" which is a different form. The ancillary data states that other forms (like verb forms) don't count, only the exact term, plural, or possessive. So \"weaponized\" wouldn't count.\n\nSource [9] from CBS News quotes Trump: \"We're turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals.\" Again, \"weaponization\" is used here.\n\nSource [10] from ABC News includes Trump's statement: \"We're turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals.\" Same as above.\n\nSource [11] is a transcript of the speech. In the transcript, Trump says, \"We\u2019re turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization, and surrender to violent criminals...\" The exact term \"weaponization\" is present.\n\nOther sources like [3], [4], [7], [12], [13], and [14] discuss the concept of weaponization in relation to the DOJ but don't provide direct evidence of Trump using the term during the March 14 speech.\n\nSo, based on sources [1], [9], [10], and [11], Trump did use the exact term \"weaponization\" during his DOJ appearance. The ancillary data allows for plural or possessive forms, but in this case, it's the base form. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump did use the term \"weaponization\" during his March 14, 2025 Department of Justice appearance. Multiple sources confirm he stated:  \n\n**\"We're turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals\"** during his speech[1][9][10][11]. The transcript explicitly shows this usage in his opening remarks[11], and CBS News/ABC News both directly quote this phrasing[9][10].  \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that pluralization/possessive forms count, but other variants like \"weaponized\" do not. In this case, Trump used the exact base term \"weaponization\" as defined in the resolution conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930178 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:16:18 UTC",
