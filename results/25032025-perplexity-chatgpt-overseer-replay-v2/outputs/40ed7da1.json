The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the deadline. So first, I need to check if there was any official announcement before March 12.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources from January 2025 indicating that Gruden was expected to be a hot candidate. For example, sources [1], [3], [7], [9], and [10] mention that teams like the Bears, Jets, Saints, and others were considering him. However, none of the search results provided mention an official announcement of Gruden being hired by any team. The latest event mentioned is the Buccaneers reinstating him into their Ring of Honor on February 27, 2025 [13], and a coaches clinic in March 2025 [12], but these aren't head coaching positions.\n\nSince the deadline has passed and there's no evidence in the provided sources of an official hiring by March 12, the market should resolve to \"No\". Even though there was speculation, without confirmation, the answer is No. The ancillary data specifies that credible reporting can be used, but all the reports here are about consideration, not official announcements. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of the event, and alignment of the recommendation with the facts. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the current date as March 25, 2025, and acknowledges that the deadline for Jon Gruden to be announced as a head coach was March 12, 2025. The AI then correctly concludes that since the current date is past the deadline, it needs to check if there was any official announcement before March 12. This adheres to the instructions of verifying events based on established facts and deadlines.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It examines multiple sources that discuss Jon Gruden's potential as a candidate for head coaching positions but finds no official announcement of his hiring by the deadline. The response also correctly notes that activities such as being reinstated into the Buccaneers' Ring of Honor and attending a coaches clinic do not qualify as being hired as a head coach, which aligns with the market's resolution conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI effectively verifies that no event of Jon Gruden being hired as a head coach occurred by the specified deadline. It aligns its recommendation (p1 - No) with the facts found, which is consistent with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI strictly adheres to the information provided and the conditions set in the user prompt without adding unnecessary speculation or irrelevant details.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation of p1 is correctly aligned with the verified facts and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the non-occurrence of the event by the specified deadline and aligns the recommendation correctly with the user prompt's conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified facts to conclude the resolution, adheres to the prompt instructions, and logically processes the information without introducing bias or errors.\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929942 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:12:22 UTC"
