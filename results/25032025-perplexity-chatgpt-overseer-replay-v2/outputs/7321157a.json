        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Dogecoin (DOGE) closed above $0.20 on March 14, 2025, at noon ET based on the Binance DOGEUSDT 1-minute candle. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mention of DOGE's price on March 14, 2025. Let's go through each source. \n\nLooking at result [1], there's a mention of DOGE dipping to $0.168333 on March 14, 2025. That's below $0.20. Another part of the same result shows a price of $0.2206, but that's from a different date (February 24, 2025). \n\nResult [6] explicitly states that as of March 14, 2025, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.1679. That's way below the $0.20 threshold. \n\nResult [8] from March 20, 2025, mentions a price of $0.17572, which is still under $0.20. \n\nOther results like [3] and [12] provide conversion rates and market data, but the dates don't align with March 14. For example, result [3] from March 19, 2025, shows DOGE at 0.17 USDT. \n\nThe key sources here are [1] and [6], both indicating that on March 14, 2025, DOGE was around $0.1679 to $0.168333, which is below $0.20. There's no conflicting data in other search results that show a price above $0.20 on that specific date and time. \n\nSince the resolution depends solely on Binance's DOGEUSDT close price at noon ET on March 14, and the provided data from Binance sources confirms the price was below $0.20, the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). No ambiguity here as the sources are consistent.\n</think>\n\nThe market resolves to \"No\" (p1) as the DOGEUSDT price on March 14, 2025, was below the $0.20 threshold.  \n\n**Key Evidence:**  \n- Binance Square data shows DOGE dipped to **$0.168333** on March 14, 2025[1].  \n- A separate Binance post confirms DOGE traded at **$0.1679** on March 14, 2025, with a 24-hour increase of 8.89% but still far below $0.20[6].  \n- Technical analyses from March 2025 consistently reference support levels between **$0.16\u2013$0.17**, with no indication of a $0.20 close on the specified date[8][12].  \n\nThe resolution conditions specify using Binance\u2019s DOGEUSDT close price, which the sources confirm did not reach $0.20 on March 14, 2025.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
