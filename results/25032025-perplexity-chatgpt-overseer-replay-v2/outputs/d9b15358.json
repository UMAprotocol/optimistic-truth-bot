The ancillary data specifies that if the Pelicans win, it's p1; if the 76ers win, p2; postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10) report that the Pelicans beat the 76ers 112-99 on Monday night, which aligns with the scheduled date. The score is consistent across these sources, confirming the result. \n\nKey points from the sources: The Pelicans had balanced scoring with Karlo Matkovic leading with 19 points. The 76ers were on a losing streak, missing key players like Embiid, George, and Maxey. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all reports mention the game occurred. No sources indicate any cancellation or postponement.\n\nSince the game was played and the Pelicans won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being incomplete or any irregularities that would trigger p3. All evidence points to a clear Pelicans victory.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Orleans Pelicans scheduled for March 24, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET was played as planned. Multiple verified sources confirm the New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Philadelphia 76ers with a final score of **112-99**[1][2][3][7][9][10]. Key contributors for the Pelicans included Karlo Matkovic (19 points, 8 assists) and Antonio Reeves (17 points, five 3-pointers), while the 76ers extended their losing streak to five games[1][3][7]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no irregularities affecting the outcome were reported. \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **\"Pelicans\"** (p1) as the Pelicans won the game outright. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907604 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:00:04 UTC"
