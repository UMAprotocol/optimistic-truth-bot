The ancillary data specifies that if the Timberwolves win, it's p1; Magic win is p2, and if canceled, p3. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n1. The YouTube video title and description from [1] state the Timberwolves defeated the Magic 118-111. Anthony Edwards had 28 points for Minnesota.\n2. TheScore.com in [2] and [3] both list the game with the Timberwolves winning 118-111. The line scores in [4] and [7] also show Minnesota's victory.\n3. CBS Sports [4] and ClickOrlando [6] articles confirm the Timberwolves' seventh straight win with the same score.\n4. Other sources like Spectrum News [8] and Fox Sports [7] reiterate the outcome.\n\nAll sources consistently report the Timberwolves won. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event occurred on March 14, which is in the past relative to the current date, and the outcome is verified across multiple reliable sources, the resolution should be p1 (Timberwolves). No conflicting information found, so no need for p4. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Orlando Magic and Minnesota Timberwolves on March 14, 2025, concluded with the **Minnesota Timberwolves winning 118-111**[1][4][6][8]. Key details from the game include:  \n- Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 28 points, while Paolo Banchero scored a career-high 43 points for the Magic[1][4].  \n- The Timberwolves rallied from an 8-point deficit in the fourth quarter with a 13-0 run to secure their seventh consecutive victory[4][6].  \n\nThe event occurred on its scheduled date, and no postponement or cancellation was reported. Based on the verified outcome and the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **p1 (Timberwolves)**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The AI strictly adheres to the requirement to base its resolution on concrete evidence and established facts, and it correctly disregards any potential for predicting outcomes or considering hypothetical scenarios.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the instructions, verifies the event accurately, and provides a clear and correct resolution recommendation based on established facts.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
