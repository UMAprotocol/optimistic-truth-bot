The ancillary data specifies that if San Francisco wins, it's p1; Utah Valley, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 19 is definitely in the past. No issues there.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome of the game. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. The first result [1] states San Francisco won 79-70. The second [2] and fifth [5] results also report the same score, with Malik Thomas scoring 21 points for San Francisco. The ESPN recap [15] and box score [13] both list the final score as 79-70 in favor of San Francisco. There's a consistent mention across these sources that San Francisco emerged victorious.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All the sources refer to the game as having taken place on March 19, with detailed recaps and stats, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: a San Francisco win corresponds to p1. Since all verified sources confirm their victory, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information found in the search results. All sources align on the outcome, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nSan Francisco defeated Utah Valley 79-70 in their NIT first-round game on March 19, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][5][13][15]. The Dons secured their first postseason win in seven years behind Malik Thomas' 21-point, 10-rebound performance and key contributions from Ryan Beasley (19 points) and Carlton Linguard Jr. (18 points)[1][2]. The game remained competitive, with Utah Valley briefly taking a 61-60 lead late in the second half before San Francisco closed with a 19-9 run[1][15]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions specifying a San Francisco victory corresponds to p1.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906903 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:48:23 UTC"
