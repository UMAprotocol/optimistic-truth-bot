        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the New Mexico vs. Marquette game. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided ancillary data. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on or before the current date, March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 21, 2025, which is in the past. So, the next step is to verify the outcome using the search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, multiple articles (1, 2, 3, 6, 13) confirm that New Mexico won the game 75-66. For example, source [1] states, \"Donovan Dent scored 21 points and No. 10 seed New Mexico took control late in the second half to defeat seventh-seeded Marquette 75-66 on Friday night in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\" This is corroborated by other sources like [6] and [13], which also report the same score and outcome. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed recaps and post-game reactions. The ancillary data specifies that if New Mexico wins, the resolution is p2. Since the game happened and New Mexico won, the correct recommendation is p2. \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Some pre-game predictions (sources 10, 14, 15) had Marquette as favorites, but the actual result is clear from the post-game reports. No sources indicate any cancellation or postponement. Therefore, the resolution should be p2: New Mexico.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between New Mexico and Marquette occurred as scheduled on March 21, 2025, at 7:25 PM ET. According to verified game recaps from multiple sources including CBS Sports, ESPN, and the official Marquette athletics website, **New Mexico defeated Marquette 75-66** in the first round of the NCAA Tournament[1][3][6][13]. The Lobos secured their first March Madness victory since 2012 behind standout performances from Donovan Dent (21 points) and Nelly Junior Joseph (19 points)[1][6].\n\nKey details confirming the outcome:\n- Final score: **New Mexico 75**, Marquette 66[1][3][6][13]\n- The game was played to completion with no postponement or cancellation reported[1][3][6]\n- Postgame press conferences and official team statements confirm the result[2][4][7]\n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided (p2 for New Mexico win), the market should resolve to **New Mexico** as the decisive winner of this completed game.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a New Mexico win corresponds to a resolution of p2. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by confirming the event occurred in the past and by using multiple sources to verify the outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the sequence of verification, starting from the date of the event to confirming the outcome through multiple reliable sources. It correctly ignores predictions and focuses on the actual results, which is in line with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through credible sources, including CBS Sports, ESPN, and the official Marquette athletics website. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (New Mexico win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There is no missing information relevant to the resolution of the query. The response does not exhibit bias and accurately reflects the event's outcome without errors.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906617 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:43:37 UTC"
