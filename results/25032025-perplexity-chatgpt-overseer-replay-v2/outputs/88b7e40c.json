        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Cavaliers vs. Kings game on March 19, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1; Cavaliers win, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 19 is definitely in the past. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome of the game using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the Kings won. Source [1] states the Kings defeated the Cavaliers 123-119. Source [2] also mentions the Kings' victory with DeMar DeRozan scoring 27 points. Source [8] from ESPN UK's recap clearly states the final score as Kings 123-119 Cavaliers. Additionally, source [10] and [15] are YouTube videos titled with the Kings' win. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources point to the game having taken place as scheduled with the Kings winning. Even though some sources like [4] and [12] predicted a Cavaliers win, the actual result from the game day sources confirms the Kings' victory. \n\nTherefore, according to the resolution conditions, since the Kings won, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information or future dates here. All checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe Sacramento Kings defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 123-119 in their March 19, 2025 NBA matchup at Golden 1 Center[1][2][8][10][15]. Despite being short-handed without key players Domantas Sabonis (ankle injury) and Zach LaVine (personal reasons), the Kings overcame a 13-point first-quarter deficit through clutch performances from DeMar DeRozan (team-high 27 points) and Malik Monk (22 points, 8 assists)[2][3][8]. Rookie Devin Carter added 16 points and critical defensive plays, including three steals[6][15].\n\nCleveland's Evan Mobley led all scorers with 31 points, with 22 coming in the final 15 minutes, but couldn't prevent the Cavaliers' third consecutive loss after their 16-game winning streak[2][5][8]. The Kings improved to 35-33 while the Cavaliers fell to 56-13[1][8].\n\n**Key factors in the outcome:**\n- Sacramento's 16-8 advantage in fast-break points[6]\n- Cleveland's 21 turnovers compared to Sacramento's 15[8]\n- Kings' 7-0 fourth-quarter run to take the lead for good[8]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled on March 19 without postponement or cancellation[1][2][8][10]. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **Kings** as the decisive winner.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923466 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:24:26 UTC"
