Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Rajasthan Royals (RR) vs Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) IPL match scheduled for March 26, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if KKR wins, it's p1 (Kolkata), RR wins p2 (Rajasthan), and if the game isn't completed by April 1, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 26, 2025, 7:07:25 PM UTC. The match was scheduled for March 26 at 10:00 AM ET, which is 2:00 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the scheduled match time, the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]) report that KKR won the match by 8 wickets. Specifically, Quinton de Kock's unbeaten 97 led KKR to victory. The match was completed on March 26, well before the April 1 deadline. \n\nI need to ensure there's no confusion about the match being postponed or incomplete. All sources confirm the match took place as scheduled, with a clear result. No mentions of the match being abandoned or affected by external factors. \n\nSince KKR won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Kolkata). There's no need to consider p3 because the game was completed on time. All sources consistently report KKR's victory, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Rajasthan Royals (RR) vs Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) IPL 2025 match scheduled for March 26, 2025, concluded with **Kolkata Knight Riders winning by eight wickets**[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Quinton de Kock's unbeaten 97 off 61 balls anchored KKR's successful chase of 152, achieved in 17.3 overs[2][5][7]. The match was completed on March 26, 2025, well before the April 1 deadline specified in the resolution conditions.  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- **Result**: KKR won decisively[1][2][7].  \n- **Match completion**: No delays or cancellations reported[1][2][6][7].  \n\n**Resolution**: The outcome aligns with the ancillary data\u2019s condition for a KKR victory, corresponding to **p1 (\"Kolkata\")**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015980 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:06:20 UTC"
