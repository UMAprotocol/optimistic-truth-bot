        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Anaheim Ducks vs. Nashville Predators game on March 20, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Ducks win, it's p2; if the Predators win, p1; postponed stays open, canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 20, 2025. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred. No need to worry about postponement or cancellation now. \n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to confirm the game's outcome. Multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [10], [12], [13]) report the final score as Ducks 4, Predators 1. For example, source [2] states the Ducks won 4-1, completing a season sweep. Source [5] mentions John Gibson's 33 saves leading to the Ducks' victory. \n\nSteven Stamkos scored first for the Predators, but the Ducks dominated the second period with three goals. The game details in sources [3] and [4] break down the scoring by period, showing Anaheim's comeback. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable.\n\nSince the Ducks won definitively, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. All sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks defeated the Nashville Predators 4-1 in their NHL game on March 20, 2025, at Bridgestone Arena. The Ducks secured the win with a three-goal second period, including contributions from Trevor Zegras (1 goal, 1 assist), Mason McTavish (2 assists), and John Gibson (33 saves)[2][5][8]. Steven Stamkos scored Nashville's lone goal, marking his 578th career goal to pass Mark Recchi for 22nd in NHL history[7][10]. \n\nThe game occurred as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the verified sources. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Ducks\"** (p2) as the Anaheim Ducks won decisively. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response then accurately reports the outcome of the game based on multiple sources, stating that the Ducks won 4-1. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Ducks win corresponds to p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and then proceeds to verify the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly concludes that there were no indications of postponement or cancellation, which matches the conditions provided in the user prompt for resolving the market.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through reliable sources, ensuring that the information is factual and not speculative. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Ducks\" (p2) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and aligns with the user prompt's requirements.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
