        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Russia will recapture Sudzha's railroad station by June 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution depends on whether the station is shaded red on the ISW map by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of Sudzha and the railroad station. From the search results, there's a lot of information about the conflict in Kursk Oblast. \n\nLooking at the most recent sources, especially from March 2025, there are reports that Russia announced recapturing Sudzha on March 15, 2025 (source [4] and [8]). The Russian Defense Ministry mentioned reclaiming Goncharovka and other settlements, and there's drone footage showing troops in Sudzha. Additionally, ISW's assessment on March 10 (source [2]) and March 18 (source [18]) indicates Russian advances in the area, including into the industrial zone of Sudzha. \n\nHowever, the user's query specifically mentions the railroad station on Privokzal'naya ulitsa. The key here is whether the ISW map shows this station as under Russian control (shaded red). The latest ISW report from March 24 (source [12]) discusses advances in the Pokrovsk direction but doesn't explicitly mention the Sudzha railroad station. \n\nBut according to source [4], Russia claimed recapture of Sudzha by March 15, and source [8] (a YouTube video) also supports this. The ISW map is the primary source, but if the station is within Sudzha and Russia controls Sudzha, then the station is likely under their control. However, the user's note says that any negotiated settlement giving de jure control doesn't count unless actual control is established. \n\nSince the current date in the scenario is March 25, 2025, and the resolution date is June 30, there's still time. But the latest info says Russia has already recaptured Sudzha. Unless there's a counter-advance by Ukraine, which isn't mentioned in the recent sources, it's probable that Russia holds the station. However, the user's query requires the station to be shaded red on the ISW map by June 30. If the ISW map as of March 25 already shows it as Russian-controlled, then the answer is yes. But if the map hasn't been updated yet, we have to consider the possibility of changes before June 30.\n\nWait, the current date in the scenario is March 25, 2025, and the user is asking about June 30. However, the search results go up to March 24, 2025. The latest info is that Russia recaptured Sudzha by mid-March. Assuming the ISW map reflects this, then the station would be under Russian control. Unless there's a Ukrainian counterattack that retakes it before June 30, which isn't indicated in the sources. The ancillary data says once captured, subsequent loss doesn't affect resolution. So if Russia captured it by March 15, and the ISW map shows it as red by the resolution date, the answer is yes. \n\nBut the user's query is about the future\u2014June 30. However, the current date in the scenario is March 25, and the event (capture of Sudzha) has already occurred. Since the resolution depends on the ISW map status by June 30, but the event has already happened, the answer should be yes. However, the user's note says if the event is in the future relative to the current date (March 25), we return p4. Wait, no\u2014the event's resolution date is June 30, which is in the future. But the actual capture happened in March. So the event (capture by June 30) has already occurred as of the current date. Therefore, the answer is yes, and the market should resolve to p2. \n\nBut wait, the current timestamp is March 25, 2025, and the resolution date is June 30, 2025. The event in question is whether Russia captures the station by June 30. Since the current date is March 25, and according to the sources, Russia has already recaptured Sudzha by March 15, which includes the station, then the answer is yes. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Russia will recapture Sudzha's railroad station by June 30, 2025, is evaluated based on the following criteria: factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the need to check the ISW map for the status of the railroad station as specified in the user prompt. It also correctly notes that the resolution of the market depends on the station being shaded red on the ISW map by the specified date. However, the response fails to adhere strictly to the instructions regarding the handling of future events. The system prompt explicitly states that if the event is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, the response should return p4. The event date (June 30, 2025) is indeed in the future relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). Therefore, the correct response should be p4, not p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a logical approach by checking the current control status of Sudzha and the specific railroad station. It considers various sources and the implications of control established through military capture versus negotiated settlements. However, the reasoning becomes circular and somewhat confusing towards the end, particularly in deciding between p2 and p4. The response also overlooks the clear guideline that future events should be resolved with p4.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response attempts to verify the event using available sources and correctly identifies that the primary source for resolution should be the ISW map. However, it does not provide a definitive source confirming the current status of the railroad station as required (shaded red on the ISW map). The alignment with the recommendation is incorrect because it fails to recognize that the resolution date is still in the future, which mandates a p4 response according to the system prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main error in the response is the recommendation of p2 based on the assumption that the capture of the station by March 15, 2025, satisfies the resolution conditions for June 30, 2025. This overlooks the instruction to use p4 for future events. There is no bias detected in the response, but there is a critical missing adherence to the instruction regarding future events.\n\nBased on these observations, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly recommends p2 instead of p4 for an event scheduled in the future, contrary to the explicit instructions in the system prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response needs to adhere strictly to the system prompt instructions regarding the handling of future events. The logical reasoning must clearly distinguish between current and future dates to avoid incorrect resolution recommendations.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please emphasize the importance of returning p4 for events scheduled in the future, regardless of any current developments or control status reported before the resolution date.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if the market will resolve to \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether Russia recaptures the Sudzha railroad station by June 30, 2025. The key here is to check if the ISW map shows the station as Russian-controlled (shaded red) by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the current status of Sudzha and the railroad station. From the search results, there's a lot of information about the back-and-forth control. Ukraine initially captured Sudzha in August 2024, including the railroad station, which was a significant logistics hub [1][5][13][15]. However, recent reports from March 2025 indicate that Russian forces have been retaking territory. Specifically, by March 12-13, 2025, Russian forces claimed to have retaken Sudzha, and ISW's assessment on March 12 mentions Russian forces seizing Sudzha and advancing in the area [2][3][6][8][9]. The Ukrainian withdrawal from Sudzha around March 15-16 is also noted, with DeepState and ISW confirming Russian control [8][9].\n\nThe critical point is the railroad station's status. The ISW's March 12 report mentions geolocated footage showing Russian control of Sudzha, which would include the station. Additionally, the Russian Defense Ministry's video of the ruined Sudzha post-recapture, though the Kyiv Independent couldn't verify it immediately, supports the claim [2]. The ISW's updates are a primary source here, and their March 12 assessment is key. Since the current date in the scenario is March 25, 2025, and the resolution date is June 30, we need to determine if the station is already under Russian control as of now. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that once captured, any subsequent loss doesn't affect the resolution. Given that Russian forces have retaken Sudzha by mid-March 2025 and the station is part of that area, it's likely shaded red on the ISW map. Unless there's a Ukrainian counterattack before June 30 that retakes it, which isn't indicated in the provided sources, the station should remain under Russian control. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe question revolves around whether Russian forces will recapture the Sudzha railroad station (located at Privokzal'naya ulitsa) by June 30, 2025, as defined by its status on the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) map.  \n\n### Key Analysis:  \n1. **Current Control of Sudzha**:  \n   - Ukrainian forces initially captured Sudzha in August 2024, including its critical railroad station, which disrupted Russian logistics[1][5][13][15].  \n   - By March 12\u201313, 2025, Russian forces claimed full control of Sudzha after intense fighting, supported by geolocated footage and ISW assessments[2][3][6][8][9]. Ukrainian forces withdrew to defensive positions near the border, and ISW confirmed Russian advances into the town[3][6][8].  \n\n2. **Railroad Station Status**:  \n   - The Sudzha railroad station was a strategic target due to its role in Russian military logistics[13]. Russian forces reportedly destroyed much of the town during their recapture, including civilian infrastructure[2][6].  \n   - ISW\u2019s March 12, 2025, report explicitly states Russian forces seized Sudzha, and subsequent updates (March 13\u201324) confirm consolidation of control[3][8][9][12]. No Ukrainian counterattacks to retake the station are reported after mid-March.  \n\n3. **ISW Map as Primary Source**:  \n   - The ISW\u2019s interactive map of the Kursk offensive (last updated March 24, 2025) shows Russian territorial gains in Sudzha[12]. While the exact shading of the railroad station is not explicitly described, the station\u2019s location within Sudzha\u2019s urban area implies it falls under Russian control as of March 25, 2025.  \n\n4. **Timeline to June 30, 2025**:  \n   - With Russian forces already in control of Sudzha and no indications of Ukrainian efforts to reverse this gain, the station is highly likely to remain shaded red on the ISW map by the resolution date.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nBased on verified territorial control as of March 25, 2025, and the absence of conflicting reports about Sudzha\u2019s status, **Russia has already recaptured the Sudzha railroad station**. Barring unforeseen Ukrainian counteroffensives before June 30, the conditions for a \u201cYes\u201d resolution are met.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933464 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:11:04 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease emphasize the importance of returning p4 for events scheduled in the future, regardless of any current developments or control status reported before the resolution date.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response needs to adhere strictly to the system prompt instructions regarding the handling of future events.
