The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, it's p1; Sabres win is p2; postponed or canceled would be p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query says March 20 at 9:00 PM ET. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. That means I don't have to worry about future events. \n\nNext, check the search results to find out who won. Looking through the sources, multiple reports (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14) mention Utah winning 5-2. For example, source [1] states, \"Dylan Guenther puts Utah ahead to stay in 5-2 win over the Buffalo Sabres.\" Similarly, source [5] confirms the final score and Utah's victory. \n\nI also need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources reference the game occurring on March 20, with detailed stats and play-by-plays, so it definitely took place. There's no mention of cancellation or postponement. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: Utah's win corresponds to p1. The own goal incident and other game details don't affect the outcome\u2014only the final result matters. Since Utah won, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres faced the Utah Hockey Club on March 20, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. According to multiple verified sources, **Utah Hockey Club won the game 5-2**[1][2][4][5][8]. Key moments included:\n\n- **Dylan Guenther** scoring the go-ahead goal at 14:13 of the third period[1][5].\n- **Mikhail Sergachev** and **Kevin Stenlund** adding empty-net goals to seal the victory[2][4].\n- A critical disallowed goal for Buffalo due to goaltender interference early in the second period[1][8].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no unresolved conditions affecting the outcome were reported. Based on the ancillary data provided, the market resolves to **p1 (Utah)**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
