The ancillary data specifies that if Houston wins, it's p1; Gonzaga, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 22, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the result using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, all of them (1 through 8) report that Houston beat Gonzaga 81-76. For example, source [1] states, \"Houston held on to beat eighth-seeded Gonzaga 81-76\" and mentions they advanced to the Sweet 16. Other sources like [2], [3], and [4] confirm the same score and outcome. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nSince the event occurred, and Houston won, the resolution should be p1. The answer needs to clearly state the outcome, cite the sources, and end with the recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Gonzaga and Houston occurred on March 22, 2025, as scheduled. According to multiple verified reports, **No. 1 seed Houston defeated No. 8 seed Gonzaga 81-76** in a closely contested second-round matchup[1][2][3][4]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the final result was confirmed through official game statistics and post-game coverage. Houston's victory advanced them to the Sweet 16, ending Gonzaga's nine-year streak of reaching that round[5][6][7]. \n\nGiven the resolution conditions defined in the ancillary data, the market resolves to **Houston** as the winning team. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately states that the NCAA men's basketball game between Gonzaga and Houston took place on March 22, 2025, and that Houston won the game with a score of 81-76. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"Houston\" if they win. The response correctly identifies that the game was neither postponed nor canceled.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It provides a clear and direct conclusion based on these verifications, which is a strong point in its reasoning.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, which it references in the summary. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Houston\" (p1) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Houston win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information and sticks to the facts required to resolve the query. It also correctly ends with the recommendation format as instructed.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the verification of the event aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Gonzaga vs. Houston game, adheres to the resolution conditions, and logically concludes based on verified facts.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742910032 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:40:32 UTC",
