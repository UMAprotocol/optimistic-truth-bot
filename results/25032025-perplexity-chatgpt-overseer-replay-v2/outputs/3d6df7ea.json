The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, it's p1; if Ducks win, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results include several sources (9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15) that report the game took place on March 12. For example, source 9 from CBS Sports and source 15 from ESPN both have detailed box scores and recaps of the game, confirming it was played. \n\nNext, determine the outcome. Multiple sources state that Utah won 3-2. Source 9 mentions Dylan Guenther's winning goal in the third period, and source 15's headline clearly states Utah Hockey Club beat the Ducks 3-2. The box score in source 14 also shows Utah with 3 goals to Anaheim's 2. \n\nNow, check for any postponement or cancellation. All sources refer to the game happening on March 12 without mention of delays or cancellations. The game was part of the regular season, and the detailed play-by-play in the recaps confirms it was completed. \n\nSince the game was played and Utah won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no indication of a postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable here. All the evidence points to a Utah victory, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Anaheim Ducks and Utah Hockey Club on March 12, 2025, was played as scheduled, with Utah winning 3-2[9][10][12][13][14][15]. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred without postponement or cancellation, including detailed box scores and recaps of Utah's third-period power-play goal by Dylan Guenther that secured the victory[9][12][15]. \n\n**Resolution Analysis**  \n- **Game Outcome**: Utah Hockey Club defeated the Anaheim Ducks 3-2[9][12][15].  \n- **Postponement/Cancellation**: No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in the search results; all sources confirm the game concluded[9][10][14].  \n\n**Recommendation**: p1 (Utah)  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response uses multiple sources to confirm that the game was played as scheduled and that Utah won, aligning with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds through the necessary steps to resolve the query: verifying the event occurred, confirming the outcome, and checking for any postponements or cancellations. It provides a clear and reasoned recommendation based on the evidence gathered from the sources.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Utah win) directly with the facts as outlined in the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks for postponements and cancellations and confirms the outcome using several sources.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906520 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:42:00 UTC"
