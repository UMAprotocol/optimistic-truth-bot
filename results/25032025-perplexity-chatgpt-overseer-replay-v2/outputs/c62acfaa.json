The resolution conditions are p1 for Liberty, p2 for Kennesaw State, and p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on March 14. The current date is March 25, so the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game on March 14. For example, sources [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], and [15] all discuss the Conference USA Tournament semifinal game between Liberty and Kennesaw State on that date. \n\nNext, I need to determine the outcome. Multiple sources report that Liberty won the game. Specifically, source [9] states Liberty staged a comeback to win 81-79. Source [12] also mentions Kaden Metheny scoring 24 points leading Liberty to victory. The final score from the box score in [15] confirms Liberty 81, Kennesaw State 79. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game taking place as scheduled, with detailed play-by-plays and post-game analyses. No indications of cancellation or postponement. \n\nSince the game occurred and Liberty won, the market should resolve to p1. All conditions are met: the event date is past, the game was played, and Liberty was the winner. No conflicting information found in the sources.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between Kennesaw State and Liberty scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 12:30 PM ET was played as planned. **Liberty defeated Kennesaw State 81-79** in the Conference USA Tournament semifinals[9][11][12][13][14][15]. The game featured a significant second-half comeback by Liberty, led by Kaden Metheny's 24 points and seven three-pointers[9][12][14]. \n\nKey details:\n- **Final score**: Liberty 81, Kennesaw State 79[12][15].\n- **Game status**: Completed without postponement or cancellation[9][11][12].\n- **Resolution conditions**: Since Liberty won, the market resolves to \"Liberty\" (p1).\n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome matches the user prompt's resolution condition for Liberty's win (p1). The response also confirms that the game was neither postponed nor canceled, which aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a logical flow from verifying the date and occurrence of the event to confirming the outcome and checking for any possible cancellations or postponements. It uses multiple sources to corroborate the game's outcome, ensuring the recommendation is based on verified facts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks multiple sources to confirm the outcome. The alignment of the recommendation (p1 for Liberty's win) with the verified outcome of the game is accurate and follows the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks for the game's status and outcome, using multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923081 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:18:01 UTC"
