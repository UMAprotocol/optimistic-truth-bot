The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the San Jos\u00e9 State vs. New Mexico CBB game that was scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if New Mexico wins, it's p1; San Jos\u00e9 State, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened 12 days ago. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, especially [3], [4], [5], and [7], they all report that New Mexico won the game 63-52. For example, source [4] from the Associated Press clearly states the final score and that Donovan Dent led New Mexico with 25 points. The box scores in [3] and [7] confirm the 63-52 result. \n\nI also need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed stats and player performances. No sources indicate any issues with the game's completion. \n\nSince the event occurred, and New Mexico won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. There's no conflicting information in the search results, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe San Jos\u00e9 State vs. New Mexico CBB game occurred on March 13, 2025, as scheduled. According to verified reports from the Associated Press and CBS Sports, **New Mexico defeated San Jos\u00e9 State with a final score of 63-52**[4][5][7]. Key performances included Donovan Dent's 25 points for New Mexico and Sadaidriene Hall's 13 points for San Jos\u00e9 State[4][5]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is definitively recorded.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate and complete based on the evaluation criteria provided. Here is a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the San Jos\u00e9 State vs. New Mexico CBB game occurred on March 13, 2025, and that New Mexico won with a score of 63-52. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a New Mexico win corresponds to a resolution of p1. The response also correctly notes that the game was neither postponed nor canceled, which matches the conditions for resolution specified in the prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event is in the past. It then verifies the outcome using multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The response also checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled, which there are none, thus adhering to the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses verified sources such as the Associated Press and CBS Sports to confirm the outcome of the game. This verification process is in line with the requirement to use concrete evidence and established facts. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided, where p1 corresponds to a New Mexico win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and system prompt instructions, providing a resolution based solely on verified facts without any assumptions or predictions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
