The user wants to resolve a betting market based on the outcome of the Kentucky vs. Alabama CBB game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Kentucky wins, it's p2; Alabama wins, p1; postponed remains open; canceled entirely resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14. Looking at the search results, there's a game recap from ESPN (source [7]) dated March 14, 2025, where Alabama defeated Kentucky 99-70. This confirms the game took place. \n\nNext, verify the outcome. The recap states Alabama never trailed and won convincingly. The final score was 99-70, with Labaron Philon scoring 21 points. This aligns with the resolution condition for p1 (Alabama win). \n\nCheck for any postponement or cancellation mentions. The game was played as scheduled, and there's no indication of postponement or cancellation in the sources related to this specific game. Other sources mention postponed games (like [8] and [12]), but those are unrelated to this matchup. \n\nEnsure the event in the query matches the sources. The query's date and teams align with source [7], so no confusion with other games. \n\nSince the game occurred and Alabama won, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information found in the sources. All conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Kentucky vs. Alabama CBB game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET **was played as planned** and resulted in a **99-70 victory for Alabama** [7]. The Crimson Tide dominated throughout the game, leading by 7 points at halftime and extending their advantage to 30 points late in the second half. Key contributors included Labaron Philon (21 points) and Jarin Stevenson (16 points) [7].\n\nThis outcome triggers the resolution condition defined in the ancillary data:\n- **Alabama win** \u2192 **p1** resolution [7]\n\nThe game was **not postponed or canceled**, as evidenced by:\n1. Completed box score and detailed game recap from ESPN [7]\n2. No references to weather delays or venue changes in related sources\n3. Confirmation of Alabama advancing to SEC Tournament semifinals [7]\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Kentucky vs. Alabama CBB game on March 14, 2025) and verifies that it occurred as scheduled, which is after the current timestamp of March 25, 2025. The response uses a reliable source (ESPN) to confirm the outcome of the game, which is Alabama's victory. This is in line with the system prompt's requirement to use verified facts and concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds through the necessary checks: verifying the event date, confirming the event took place, checking the outcome, and ensuring there were no postponements or cancellations. Each step is supported by evidence from the source, and the response concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event against the user prompt and confirms that the details match (date and teams involved). The outcome of the game (Alabama win) directly triggers the resolution condition for p1, which is correctly recommended.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the information provided in the user prompt and uses a reliable source for verification.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935062 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:37:42 UTC"
