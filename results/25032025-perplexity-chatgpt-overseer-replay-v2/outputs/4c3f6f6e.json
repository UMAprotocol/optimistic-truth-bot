The resolution depends on whether he used that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The sources provided are the search results, and there's a video linked as a source. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the search results for mentions of Trump's speech or statements during that event. The key here is to find any instance where he said \"Feminist\" or its forms. Let's go through each relevant search result.\n\nLooking at result [1], it's about Trump taking control of the board and criticizing the center's design and spending. He mentions \"woke\" shows but doesn't mention \"Feminist.\" Result [8] mentions his visit and criticism of the center's state, but again, no mention of the specific term. Result [9] from the LA Times details his comments slamming 'Hamilton' and discussing Broadway hits, but again, no \"Feminist.\" Result [13] is a video of Trump speaking to reporters, but the transcript summary doesn't include the word. Result [19] is a duplicate of [1], so same conclusion.\n\nNone of the search results mention Trump using the word \"Feminist\" during the event. The video source (result [13]) is crucial here. Since the user specified that the resolution source is the video, and the search results don't indicate any usage of the term, it's safe to conclude he didn't say it.

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have followed the instructions provided in the system prompt accurately and effectively. The response is focused on verifying whether Donald Trump said the word \"Feminist\" during his appearance at the Kennedy Center event on March 17, 2025. The AI checked multiple sources, including a video which is specified as the resolution source in the user prompt, and found no evidence of the word being used. This leads to a recommendation of p1, which corresponds to \"No,\" aligning with the conditions set in the user prompt.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evaluation:\n\n1. Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:\n   - The response adheres strictly to the user prompt by focusing on the specific term \"Feminist\" and its variations as outlined.\n   - The AI correctly identifies that the resolution source should be the video of the event and bases its conclusion on this source along with other search results.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness:\n   - The AI's reasoning process is logical, checking through various sources to confirm the absence of the term \"Feminist.\"\n   - The response is complete in that it covers all necessary aspects to make an informed resolution based on the evidence available.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The AI verifies that the event took place as scheduled and scrutinizes the content of Trump\u2019s speech during the event.\n   - The recommendation aligns with the factual findings from the verified sources, particularly the video which is central to the resolution.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:\n   - There appears to be no missing information relevant to the resolution of the query.\n   - The response does not exhibit bias and is free from errors based on the information provided and the requirements of the user prompt.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and adherence to the prompt, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and does not require a rerun. The AI has effectively used the available sources to confirm that Donald Trump did not use the word \"Feminist\" during the event, leading to a resolution of p1.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, effectively uses the specified sources, and logically concludes based on the evidence provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and follows the instructions precisely, with a clear and logical examination of the sources leading to an accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908643 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:17:23 UTC",
