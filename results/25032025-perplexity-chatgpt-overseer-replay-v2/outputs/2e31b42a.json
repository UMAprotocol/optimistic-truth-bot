The ancillary data specifies that if Akron wins, it's p1; Toledo, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14, so the game should have already happened. Now, looking through the search results, several sources mention the March 14 game. \n\nSearch result [1] is from the Akron athletics site, titled \"Akron Advances to Second Straight MAC Title Game With 100-90 Win Over Toledo\" dated March 14, 2025. It clearly states Akron won 100-90. Similarly, [4] and [6] are CBS Sports and WTOP articles confirming the same score and outcome. [3] and [9] are about a March 4 game where Akron also won, but that's a different date. \n\nThe user's query is specifically about the March 14 game. All relevant sources for that date confirm Akron's victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to Akron (p1). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The other results, like [2], [5], [7], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], are about different games (women's basketball, earlier men's games, football) or other dates, so they're not relevant here. \n\nSince the March 14 game happened as scheduled and Akron won, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Toledo vs. Akron men's basketball game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 5:00 PM ET was played as planned. Akron defeated Toledo 100-90 in the Mid-American Conference Tournament semifinals[1][4][6]. Nate Johnson led the Zips with a career-high 31 points, while Toledo's Seth Hubbard scored 28 points[1][4]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game was required.  \n\n**Resolution Recommendation**  \nBased on the verified outcome and the resolution conditions provided, this market should resolve to **\"Akron\"** (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908756 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:19:16 UTC"
