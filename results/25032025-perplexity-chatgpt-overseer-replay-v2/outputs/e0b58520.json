The ancillary data specifies that if the Raptors win, it's p2; if the Trail Blazers win, p1. If postponed, it stays open, and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 16 is definitely in the past. No issues there.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome of the game. Looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [9], [10], [11]) report that the Trail Blazers won 105-102. The AP recap mentions Anfernee Simons scoring 22 points, Toumani Camara adding 21, and a key block by Matisse Thybulle in the closing seconds. The ESPN recap also confirms the Blazers' victory. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. The Trail Blazers' win is well-documented across CBS Sports, ESPN, and YouTube highlights. \n\nSince the event occurred, and the Trail Blazers won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information found. All sources align on the outcome. So the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and Portland Trail Blazers on March 16, 2025, concluded with the **Portland Trail Blazers winning 105-102**[1][9][11]. Key details from the game include:  \n- Anfernee Simons led the Trail Blazers with 22 points, including 12 in the fourth quarter, while Toumani Camara added 21 points and tied his career high with five three-pointers[1][11].  \n- Matisse Thybulle\u2019s critical block on Orlando Robinson\u2019s potential game-tying three-pointer in the final seconds secured Portland\u2019s victory[1][9].  \n- The Trail Blazers rallied from a 16-point deficit, hitting 18 three-pointers as a team[1][10].  \n\nThe game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the verified sources. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **p1** (Trail Blazers win).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and Portland Trail Blazers took place on March 16, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past event. The response accurately reports the outcome of the game based on multiple reliable sources, stating that the Portland Trail Blazers won with a score of 105-102. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Trail Blazers win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and verifies the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly concludes that there were no postponements or cancellations, which matches the conditions provided for resolution. The response then logically recommends p1 based on the verified outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through credible sources and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. This ensures that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any reliance on unverified or irrelevant sources and sticks strictly to the event in question as outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation of p1 is well-supported by verified facts and aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions specified.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, verifies the event accurately, and provides a logical and well-supported recommendation.\"\n}\n```",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926548 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:15:48 UTC"
