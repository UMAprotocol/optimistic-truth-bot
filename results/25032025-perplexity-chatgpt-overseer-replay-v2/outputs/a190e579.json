        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Cornell vs. Yale CBB game scheduled for March 16, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Yale wins, it's p1; Cornell wins, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on that date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game. \n\nSearch result [1] is from Cornell's athletics site, dated March 16, 2025, titled \"Yale Holds Off Furious Big Red Comeback, Earns Ivy League's NCAA Bid.\" The article states Yale won 90-84 in the Ivy League Tournament final. That's a direct mention of the game date and outcome. \n\nSearch result [4] from ESPN also confirms the final score as Yale 90-84 Cornell on March 16, 2025. Another source, [5], is a live blog from the Yale Daily News covering the game in real-time, with updates showing Yale leading and eventually winning. \n\nAdditionally, [7] discusses a previous game between Yale and Cornell on February 22, 2025, where Yale won, but that's a different date. The key here is the March 16 game. \n\nAll relevant sources point to Yale winning the March 16 game. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Yale). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other search results mention different sports (lacrosse, baseball) or earlier basketball games, but the March 16 game is clearly covered in [1], [4], and [5]. No sources indicate the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nThus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Cornell vs. Yale men's basketball game scheduled for March 16, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET concluded with a **90-84 victory for Yale** in the Ivy League Tournament championship game[1][4][5]. The Bulldogs secured the Ivy League's automatic NCAA Tournament bid with this win, while Cornell became eligible for the NIT[1]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- Yale shot **57% from three-point range** (13-of-23) and committed only **3 turnovers**[1]\n- Cornell mounted a second-half comeback attempt, shooting **71% from the floor** after halftime but ultimately falling short[1]\n- Yale's John Poulikidas led all scorers with **25 points**, while Cornell's AK Okereke had a team-high **22 points**[1][4]\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any verified sources[1][4][5]. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome, the market should resolve to Yale's victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Verification of Event**: The response accurately identifies and confirms the outcome of the Cornell vs. Yale basketball game held on March 16, 2025. It uses multiple reliable sources, including Cornell's athletics site and ESPN, to verify that Yale won the game with a score of 90-84. This is consistent with the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\n\n2. **Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions. It correctly identifies that the event is in the past relative to the current timestamp and proceeds to verify the outcome based on reliable sources. The response does not predict or assume but relies on concrete evidence from the event.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources to arrive at a conclusion. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and finds none, thus adhering to the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data (p1 for Yale win).\n\n4. **Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Yale win) is directly aligned with the verified facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt. The response ensures that the resolution recommendation corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n5. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no missing information, apparent biases, or errors in the response. The response focuses solely on the specified event and uses multiple sources to confirm the details, ensuring a robust verification process.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Cornell vs. Yale basketball game using reliable sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the verified facts and resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions without any errors or biases.\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928499 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:48:19 UTC"
