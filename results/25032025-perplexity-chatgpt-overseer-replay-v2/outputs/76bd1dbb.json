The ancillary data specifies that if California Baptist wins, it's p1; Tarleton, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome of the game. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] from March 14, 2025, details the WAC quarterfinal game where California Baptist (CBU) defeated Tarleton State 55-51. It mentions CBU's lead in the second half and the final score.\n- Source [6] and [7] from ESPN confirm the same final score, with CBU winning 55-51. They also note that CBU advanced to the semifinals.\n- Source [8] from CBU's official site also reports their victory, advancing to the WAC semifinals for the first time.\n\nOther sources like [4] provide the box score, showing CBU's 55-51 win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All relevant sources indicate the game was played as scheduled, and CBU won. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (California Baptist). No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between Tarleton State and California Baptist occurred on March 13, 2025, as scheduled. California Baptist defeated Tarleton State with a final score of **55-51** in the WAC Tournament quarterfinals[1][6][8]. Key details:  \n- CBU led 30-21 at halftime and maintained control despite Tarleton\u2019s late rally[1][6].  \n- Adam Moussa\u2019s clutch three-pointer with 1:03 remaining secured CBU\u2019s lead[1][8].  \n- The game concluded without postponement or cancellation[1][6][8].  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **California Baptist (p1)**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742921956 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:59:16 UTC"
