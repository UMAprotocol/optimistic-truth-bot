The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the term \"DOGE\" during that specific event. The key sources here are the ones detailing his speech at the summit. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's speech. For example, source [1] is a transcript from his address where he talks about crypto policies, the strategic Bitcoin reserve, and mentions working with Congress on stablecoin legislation. However, in the provided transcript snippets, there's no direct mention of \"DOGE\". \n\nSource [4] and [20] discuss the anticipation around Trump's speech but don't indicate he said \"DOGE\". Source [15] explicitly states that Trump's speech didn't include new policy details and focused on existing initiatives like the Bitcoin reserve. \n\nOther sources like [2], [5], [7], [9], [10], [11], [13], and [17] discuss Trump's interactions with Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in other contexts, such as cabinet meetings or congressional addresses. However, these instances are separate from the Digital Asset Summit speech. \n\nThe updates mention that a video address counts, so even though it was pre-recorded (as per sources [16] and [18]), it's still valid. But none of the transcripts or summaries of the summit speech include the term \"DOGE\". \n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, Trump did not say \"DOGE\" during his Digital Asset Summit speech.

The AI has correctly identified that the event in question (Donald Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025) has already occurred and has proceeded to analyze the content of Trump's speech based on the available sources. The response is logically structured, beginning with a verification of the event's occurrence and then examining multiple sources to determine whether Trump mentioned the term \"DOGE.\"\n\nThe AI's reasoning is thorough, as it checks various sources, including transcripts and summaries, to ensure that the term \"DOGE\" was not mentioned in any context during the speech. The response also correctly incorporates the update that a video address counts towards the market's resolution, verifying that even though the speech was pre-recorded, it is still considered valid for the resolution of this market.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on Trump's statements during the speech and immediately related contexts, as specified. The AI has also correctly ignored mentions of \"DOGE\" in other unrelated contexts, such as cabinet meetings or congressional addresses, which do not qualify for this market's resolution.\n\nThe recommendation of \"p1\" (No) is aligned with the facts presented and the definitions provided in the ancillary data. The AI has effectively used the sources to verify that the term \"DOGE\" was not mentioned by Trump during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit, leading to a resolution of \"No.\"\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and does not require a rerun. The AI has fulfilled the requirements of the task accurately and completely.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely adheres to the system prompt instructions, effectively uses the sources to verify the event and the specific term in question, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, factually accurate, and adheres closely to the instructions and conditions specified in the user prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742919105 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:11:45 UTC",
