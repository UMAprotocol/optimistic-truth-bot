The ancillary data specifies that if the Magic win, it's p1; Lakers win is p2; postponed or canceled leads to p3 or 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 24, 2025, and the current date given is March 25, 2025. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] states the Magic defeated the Lakers 118-106. Source [4] and [6] also report the same score with Wagner and Banchero leading the Magic. The YouTube highlights in [2] and [7] back this up, showing the Magic's victory. Additionally, the CBS Sports recap in [5] and the AP article in [4] all align on the Magic's win. \n\nNo sources mention the game being postponed or canceled. All evidence points to the game being completed as scheduled with the Magic winning. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the correct resolution is p1 (Magic). There's no ambiguity here since all sources consistently report the Magic's victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Orlando Magic defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 118-106 on March 24, 2025, at the Kia Center in Orlando[1][4][6]. Franz Wagner led the Magic with 32 points and eight assists, while Paolo Banchero added 30 points and seven rebounds[4][6]. The Lakers, led by Luka Don\u010di\u0107's 32 points and LeBron James' 24 points, lost their third consecutive game[1][4].  \n\n**Key Details**  \n- **Final Score**: Magic 118, Lakers 106[1][4][6]  \n- **Game Impact**:  \n  - The Magic (34-38) snapped a six-game home losing streak and maintained their position in the Eastern Conference Play-In race[4][6].  \n  - The Lakers (43-28) fell into a tie for fourth place in the Western Conference[4][6].  \n- **Decisive Moments**: Orlando outscored Los Angeles 34-18 in the third quarter to take control[4][6], and Wagner/Banchero combined for 10 critical points late in the fourth to seal the win[4][6].  \n\nThe game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1][4][6].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
