        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Mississippi State vs. Missouri CBB game scheduled for March 13 at 7:00 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Missouri, p2 for Mississippi State, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so March 13, 2025, is in the past. That means the game should have already happened. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources ([1], [2], [4], [5], [7]) mention the game on March 13, 2025. Specifically, result [1] states that Missouri won 85-73. Result [2] from ESPN's box score confirms the same score. Result [5] also mentions Missouri's victory with a closing run. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nAdditionally, result [3] talks about a football game between Auburn and Mississippi State being postponed, but that's a different sport and date, so it's irrelevant here. Other results about weather ([8]) or other topics don't affect this game's outcome. \n\nSince the game occurred as scheduled and Missouri won, the resolution should be p1. The ancillary data specifies p1 corresponds to Missouri, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Mississippi State vs. Missouri men's college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET was played as planned. According to multiple verified sources, **No. 21 Missouri defeated Mississippi State 85-73** in the SEC Tournament second-round matchup[1][2][5][7]. The game remained competitive until the final four minutes, when Missouri closed on a decisive 16-4 run to secure the victory[1][7]. There is no evidence of postponement or cancellation in the search results.  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided (p1 = Missouri win, p2 = Mississippi State win, p3 = canceled/50-50), the market should resolve to **p1** (Missouri).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly states that Missouri won the game, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions (p1 for Missouri win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple sources, confirming Missouri's victory. It correctly disregards irrelevant information (e.g., a football game) and focuses solely on the basketball game in question.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the information is reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Missouri win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not contain any missing information relevant to the resolution of the query.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906496 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:41:36 UTC"
