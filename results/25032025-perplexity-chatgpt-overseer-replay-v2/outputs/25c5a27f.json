The ancillary data specifies that if McNeese State wins, the market resolves to p2, and if Clemson wins, p1. If the game is postponed, it stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 20) is in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles confirm that McNeese State (12th seed) defeated Clemson (5th seed) 69-67. Sources [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], and [8] all report McNeese's victory. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as it was played on the scheduled date. There's no mention of the game being incomplete or needing a make-up. \n\nThe resolution conditions state a McNeese win should resolve to p2. All sources agree on the result, so there's no ambiguity. Even though Clemson made a late comeback, the final score confirms McNeese's win. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe McNeese State Cowboys defeated the Clemson Tigers 69-67 in their March 20, 2025 NCAA Tournament game[1][2][4][5][8]. As a 12th-seeded team, McNeese State secured its first-ever March Madness victory by dominating early with a 31-13 halftime lead and surviving Clemson's late rally that narrowed the final margin to two points[1][2][5]. The game concluded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation[1][2][4][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response correctly identifies that the event (McNeese State vs. Clemson game) occurred on March 20, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The AI then verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all confirm that McNeese State won against Clemson with a score of 69-67. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a McNeese State win should resolve to p2.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and then verifies the outcome through reliable sources. The response also correctly adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, recommending a resolution of p2 based on McNeese State's victory.\n\nThere is no missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI does not predict or assume but relies on verified facts to make a recommendation. The response also correctly ignores any potential for the game being postponed or canceled since it confirms the game was played as scheduled.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts and the user prompt's conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the McNeese State vs. Clemson game and aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is factually accurate, logically sound, and complete.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933304 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:08:24 UTC",
