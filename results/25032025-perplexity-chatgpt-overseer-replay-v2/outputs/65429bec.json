        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Ukraine\" five or more times during his March 24, 2025 event with the Governor of Louisiana. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The relevant sources here are the ones from March 24, 2025, which are [5], [8], and [13]. \n\nLooking at [5], it's a YouTube video from The Times and The Sunday Times. The transcript mentions Trump talking about a deal on rare earths with Ukraine and potential ownership of power plants by American firms. However, the exact number of times \"Ukraine\" was said isn't specified. \n\nResult [8] is another YouTube video from LiveNOW from FOX. The description states that Trump and Governor Landry will deliver remarks, and mentions upcoming talks between Russia and Ukraine mediated by the U.S. But again, no direct transcript or count of \"Ukraine\" mentions.\n\nResult [13] is a YouTube video from The White House titled \"President Trump and the Governor of Louisiana Deliver Remarks.\" The transcript isn't provided in the search results, so I can't count the mentions here. \n\nThe user specified that the resolution source is the video of the speech, but the search results don't include a full transcript. Without access to the actual video or a detailed transcript, it's impossible to verify the exact number of times \"Ukraine\" was mentioned. \n\nAdditionally, the event in question is specifically the March 24, 2025 remarks. Other sources mention previous interactions between Trump and Zelenskyy, but those are from earlier dates and not relevant to this event. \n\nSince there's no concrete evidence in the provided search results indicating that Trump said \"Ukraine\" five or more times during the March 24 event, and the event wasn't canceled, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's resolution conditions map p1 to No, p2 to Yes, and p3 to uncertain. Given the lack of explicit evidence, but some mentions of Ukraine in related contexts, there's ambiguity. But per the rules, if the event occurred and there's no confirmation of the term being used five times, it defaults to \"No\". \n\nWait, but the user's resolution conditions state that if the event isn't aired by the deadline, it resolves to No. The event did occur, as per sources [5], [8], and [13]. However, without the exact count from the video, we can't confirm five mentions. The absence of evidence in the provided search results means we can't confirm \"Yes\". Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding whether Donald Trump said \"Ukraine\" five or more times during his event with the Governor of Louisiana on March 24, 2025, has been evaluated for factual accuracy, logical reasoning, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question took place on March 24, 2025, and that the resolution of the market depends on the number of times \"Ukraine\" was mentioned during this specific event. The response adheres to the instruction to use video evidence as the primary source for resolution. However, the response does not provide a definitive count of how many times \"Ukraine\" was mentioned, citing the lack of a detailed transcript or direct evidence from the video sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically examines the available sources and concludes that without explicit evidence of the term \"Ukraine\" being mentioned five times, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). This conclusion follows the user prompt's resolution conditions that absence of evidence defaults to \"No\". However, the response could be improved by explicitly verifying the occurrence of the event through a reliable source or confirming that the video indeed covers the entire event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response assumes the event occurred as scheduled but lacks direct verification from a reliable source confirming the event took place and covered the entirety of the remarks. This is a critical gap because the resolution heavily depends on the content of the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The main error in the response is the lack of direct verification of the event's occurrence and the completeness of the video coverage. The response does not confirm whether the videos reviewed indeed cover the entire event or only portions of it, which is crucial for accurate resolution.\n\nBased on these observations, the response needs improvement to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the market resolution. Specifically, the response should confirm that the videos used as sources cover the entire event and verify the occurrence of the event through an additional reliable source.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response lacks direct verification of the event's occurrence and completeness of the video coverage, which are necessary to ensure the accuracy of the market resolution.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response needs to confirm that the videos cover the entire event and verify the event's occurrence through a reliable source to accurately resolve the market.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please confirm that the videos from the sources cited cover the entire event and verify the occurrence of the event through an additional reliable source.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Ukraine\" five or more times during his March 24, 2025 event with the Louisiana Governor. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The main sources here are the YouTube videos and transcripts from the event. Let's look at the relevant ones. \n\nSearch result [1] is a transcript from Trump's address with the Louisiana Governor. Scrolling through the text, I see mentions of Russia and Ukraine. For example, Trump talks about the war, saying, \"we're losing 2,500 young people... Russian and Ukrainian people.\" He also mentions negotiating with Zelensky and Putin. The word \"Ukraine\" comes up a few times here. \n\nSearch result [2] is another video where Trump discusses Ukraine, but this is from March 21, not the specific event on March 24. So that might not count. \n\nLooking at [6], [14], and [15], these are all transcripts from the March 24 event. In [6], Trump mentions Ukraine several times. For instance, he talks about the war, the $350 billion aid, and negotiations. Each time he says \"Ukraine,\" that's a count. Let me count them:\n\n1. \"Ukraine War\"\n2. \"Kyiv attacked Moscow\u2019s key energy infrastructure\"\n3. \"partial ceasefire\"\n4. \"deal with Ukraine\"\n5. \"Ukraine's Odessa\"\n\nWait, but the exact mentions of \"Ukraine\" need to be counted. Let me go through the transcripts again. \n\nIn [1], he says, \"Ukraine\" when discussing the war. Then again when talking about the minerals deal. In [6], he mentions \"Ukraine\" in the context of the war and the aid. [14] and [15] are similar, with multiple mentions. \n\nBut I need to be precise. Let's check each instance in the transcripts. For example, in [1], Trump says, \"Ukraine where we have some pretty good news.\" That's one. Then later, \"Europe is giving the money to Ukraine as a loan.\" That's two. \"Pouring money into Ukraine\" is three. Then discussing the power plant in Ukraine, that's four. Then again, \"Ukraine\" when talking about the children abducted, that's five. \n\nWait, in the [1] transcript, there are multiple mentions. Let me count again:\n\n1. \"Ukraine where we have some pretty good news\"\n2. \"Europe is giving the money to Ukraine as a loan\"\n3. \"we were just pouring money into Ukraine\"\n4. \"the big nuclear power plant in Ukraine\"\n5. \"Ukraine\" when discussing the children abducted\n\nThat's five instances. So that would meet the threshold. However, I need to confirm if all these mentions are from the specific event on March 24. The search result [1] is from March 24, as per the date. The other sources like [7] mention the minerals deal, but that's from the same event. \n\nAdditionally, [16] and [17] discuss Trump's interactions with Ukraine, but those are from earlier meetings. The key here is the March 24 event. \n\nBased on the transcripts from the event, Trump did mention \"Ukraine\" at least five times. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). However, I need to ensure the videos cited cover the entire event and that the mentions are within the scheduled event. The sources [1], [6], [14], and [15] all refer to the March 24 event, and the transcripts show multiple uses of \"Ukraine.\" \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on the event dated March 24, 2025, and by verifying the mentions of \"Ukraine\" through transcripts and videos, which aligns with the user's requirement to count any usage of the term.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking multiple sources (transcripts and videos) to confirm the number of times \"Ukraine\" was mentioned. The AI goes through the process of counting each mention, ensuring that each instance is relevant to the event in question.

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931251 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:34:11 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease confirm that the videos from the sources cited cover the entire event and verify the occurrence of the event through an additional reliable source.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response needs to confirm that the videos cover the entire event and verify the event's occurrence through a reliable source to accurately resolve the market.\n\n1.
