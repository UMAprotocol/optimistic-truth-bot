The ancillary data specifies that if the Clippers win, it's p2; Hawks win, p1; postponed remains open; canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14, so the event date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 3, 6) report that the game took place on March 14. For example, source 1 from ESPN states the Clippers won 121-98. Source 3 from the LA Times and source 6 from The Atlanta Voice also confirm the Clippers' victory with the same score. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Source 4 talks about a postponed game in January 2025 due to wildfires, but that's unrelated to the March 14 game. Source 8 lists rescheduled games, but the Clippers vs. Hawks game on March 14 isn't among them. All other sources about the March 14 game describe it as having occurred with a clear result. \n\nSince the game was played, and the Clippers won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no indication of cancellation or postponement for this specific game. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Atlanta Hawks 121-98 on March 14, 2025, as verified by multiple sources[1][3][6]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the provided search results. The Clippers' victory was highlighted by a dominant 35-8 third-quarter performance led by James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, each scoring 25 points[1][3]. \n\nSince the game was completed and the Clippers won decisively, the market resolves to \"Clippers\" per the ancillary data's conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

This outcome is supported by multiple reliable sources, including ESPN and the LA Times. The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event's occurrence and outcome based on past data, as required.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and confirms none were found related to the specific game in question. It then correctly applies the ancillary data conditions to resolve the market based on the Clippers' victory.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. This shows a thorough verification process and correct application of the resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt and uses verified sources to confirm the details.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
