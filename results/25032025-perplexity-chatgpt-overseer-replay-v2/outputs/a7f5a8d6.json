The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Wisconsin vs. Michigan State CBB game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Wisconsin wins, it's p2; if Michigan State wins, p1; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 15, so the event should have already happened. Let me look through the search results to find the game's outcome. \n\nLooking at the sources, result [3] is titled \"Michigan State Falls Short Against Wisconsin in Big Ten Tournament Semifinals, 77-74\" from March 15, 2025. The article states that Wisconsin beat Michigan State 77-74. Another source, [4], confirms this with the headline \"Tonje drops 32, Badgers take down top-seeded Spartans\" and mentions the same score. Additionally, [5] provides the final score as Wisconsin 77, Michigan State 74. \n\nAll these sources agree that Wisconsin won the game on March 15. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the game was played and Wisconsin won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other sources like [10] mention Wisconsin's subsequent games but don't contradict the March 15 result. Therefore, the resolution is clear: Wisconsin won, so p2 is the correct recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe March 15, 2025, college basketball game between Wisconsin and Michigan State concluded with a **77-74 victory for Wisconsin**, as verified by multiple sources[3][4][5]. The game was played as scheduled, with no indication of postponement or cancellation. \n\nPer the resolution conditions:\n- **p2 (Wisconsin)** is the correct outcome since the Badgers won the game. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The AI checked multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is Wisconsin winning against Michigan State with a score of 77-74. This outcome aligns with the user's ancillary data where a Wisconsin win should resolve to \"p2\".\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It verified the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring there was no conflicting information regarding the game being postponed or canceled. The AI also checked subsequent events to ensure there was no contradiction in the reported results of the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI effectively verified the event's occurrence and outcome using reliable sources. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"p2\" for a Wisconsin win is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI strictly adhered to the user prompt and system instructions, focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the system prompt.

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742918261 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 15:57:41 UTC"
