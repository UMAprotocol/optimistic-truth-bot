        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his Education Event on March 20, 2025, when he signed the executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. The resolution depends on whether he used either term during that specific event.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The relevant sources here are [13], [15], and [16], which all discuss the Education Event. Let's look at each:\n\n- Source [13] from Chalkbeat details Trump's executive order to close the Department of Education. It mentions his speech about returning education to states but doesn't mention any use of \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin.\"\n- Source [15] from 19th News also covers the executive order signing. It quotes Trump talking about education and states' rights but again no mention of the keywords.\n- Source [16] from CBS News reports on the same event. Trump's comments focus on education performance and dismantling the department, with no reference to cryptocurrency terms.\n\nOther sources like [1], [2], [3], etc., discuss Trump's crypto policies and events like the Crypto Summit, but those are separate from the March 20 Education Event. The query specifically states that only the scheduled Education Event counts, so other events or mentions elsewhere don't apply.\n\nSince none of the sources covering the Education Event mention Trump using \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his speech or the signing, the answer should be \"No.\" The resolution conditions require instances during that specific event, and there's no evidence he did so there.\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results, there is no evidence that Donald Trump used the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his March 20, 2025 Education Event where he signed the executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. Multiple sources covering the event ([13][15][16]) detail his focus on education policy and returning control to states, but none mention any cryptocurrency-related terminology being used during this specific appearance.\n\nThe executive order and accompanying remarks centered on eliminating federal education oversight, with Trump stating: \"We want to return our students to the states\" and criticizing U.S. education performance[13][16]. While Trump has been actively promoting cryptocurrency initiatives through other channels like his March 7 Crypto Summit[1][11][12] and strategic bitcoin reserve plans[8][12], these developments occurred at separate events from the March 20 education-focused executive order signing.\n\nPer the market's resolution conditions, only usage during the scheduled Education Event counts toward resolution. Since no sources indicate cryptocurrency terminology was used during this particular event, the resolution should be \"No.\"\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt by focusing solely on whether Donald Trump mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during the specific Education Event on March 20, 2025. The response correctly identifies and excludes references to other events or speeches that do not pertain to this specific event, in line with the user prompt's instructions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically examining relevant sources ([13], [15], [16]) that cover the event in question. It confirms that none of these sources mention Trump using the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during the event. The response also correctly disregards mentions of these terms in other contexts or events, focusing strictly on the event specified in the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and scrutinizes the content of Trump's speech during this event, as reported by multiple sources. The recommendation of \"p1\" (No) aligns with the facts presented and the conditions outlined in the user prompt, as there is no evidence of Trump using the specified terms during the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response effectively uses the sources specified and adheres closely to the requirements of the user prompt without introducing irrelevant information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns correctly with the established facts and the conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, logically analyzes the relevant sources, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the facts and conditions specified.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively focuses on the specific event in question, correctly excludes irrelevant information, and provides a well-supported recommendation based on the sources reviewed.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935530 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:45:30 UTC",
