        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Colorado Avalanche vs. Montreal Canadiens game scheduled for March 22, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Avalanche win, it's p2; if the Canadiens win, p1; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the actual outcome of the game. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened. Let me check the search results provided. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple results mention the game. Source [1] from NHL.com states the Avalanche won in a shootout on March 23, 2025. Wait, the game was scheduled for March 22, but the article is dated March 23, which makes sense as it's a recap. The title clearly says \"Avalanche top Canadiens in shootout\" with a 5-4 score. \n\nSource [3] from Sportsnet also confirms the Avalanche won 5-4 in a shootout, with Brock Nelson scoring the winner. Source [4] from ESPN lists the final score as 5-4 Avalanche, again mentioning the shootout. Source [5] is another NHL.com recap, reiterating the shootout win. Source [7] from the Canadiens' site also acknowledges the 5-4 shootout loss. \n\nAll these sources agree that the Avalanche won the game via a shootout. According to NHL rules, a shootout victory counts as a win for the team, so the result is a Colorado win. The resolution conditions state that an Avalanche win corresponds to p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche defeated the Montreal Canadiens 5-4 in a shootout on March 22, 2025[1][3][4][5][7]. Despite Montreal's third-period comeback from a 4-1 deficit to force overtime and a shootout, Colorado's Brock Nelson scored the decisive shootout goal[3][5]. This result aligns with the resolution conditions specifying that an Avalanche victory resolves to \"Avalanche\" (p2). The game was completed as scheduled with no cancellations or postponements mentioned in any sources.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
