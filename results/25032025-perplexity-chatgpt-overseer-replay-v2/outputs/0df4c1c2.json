The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I check the current date: March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 20, which is in the past. So, the event has already occurred. Now, I need to confirm who won. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [5], [6], [8]) state that Texas A&M won 80-71. For example, source [1] says Yale's season ended with a loss to Texas A&M, and [5] mentions the Aggies' victory with a career-high from Pharrel Payne. The box scores in [2] and [8] also show Texas A&M's score as 80 versus Yale's 71. \n\nI also check if there's any mention of postponement or cancellation. All sources refer to the game happening as scheduled on March 20. No sources indicate a cancellation or postponement. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that a Texas A&M win resolves to p1. Since the game occurred and Texas A&M won, the resolution should be p1. There's no conflicting information, so no need for p3 or p4. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Yale and Texas A&M occurred as scheduled on March 20, 2025, at 7:25 PM ET. Texas A&M defeated Yale 80-71 in the NCAA Tournament First Round[1][2][5][6][8]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the final score reflects a completed contest. \n\nKey details:\n- Texas A&M's Pharrel Payne had a career-high 25 points and 10 rebounds[5][6]\n- Yale's John Poulakidas led all Bulldogs scorers with 23 points[1][5]\n- The Aggies maintained control after a 9-0 run late in the second half to secure the win[1][5]\n\nAs the game concluded with Texas A&M winning, the market resolves according to the ancillary data's p1 designation for a Texas A&M victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game occurred on March 20, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The response verifies through multiple sources that Texas A&M won the game with a score of 80-71. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Texas A&M win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for the occurrence of the game, its outcome, and any potential postponements or cancellations. It confirms the game was played as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. The response then logically concludes that the market should resolve to p1 based on the ancillary data provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, ensuring the verification of the event. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question and uses verified sources to support its conclusions.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Yale vs. Texas A&M game, correctly applies the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and provides a clear, logical resolution recommendation based on the user prompt's conditions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
