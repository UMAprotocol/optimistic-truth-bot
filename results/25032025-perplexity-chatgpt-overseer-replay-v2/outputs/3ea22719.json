The resolution depends on the station being shaded red on that map by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of Sudzha and the railroad station. From the search results, there's a lot of information. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed they retook Sudzha on March 13, 2025, and the ISW's assessment on March 12 mentioned Russian forces seizing Sudzha and advancing to areas near the station. The Wikipedia entry also notes that Ukrainian forces withdrew from Sudzha by March 12-13, 2025. \n\nLooking at the updates, the user added that any negotiated settlement giving Russia control would count as a \"Yes.\" However, the current information doesn't mention a negotiated settlement. Instead, it's about military control. The ISW map is the primary source, and if it's shaded red by April 30, it's a \"Yes.\" Since the station was captured by mid-March according to multiple sources, and the resolution conditions state that once captured, subsequent loss doesn't matter, it seems the answer is \"Yes.\"\n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The DeepStateMap and other sources confirm Russian control. Even if there's temporary glitches, the user specified those aren't considered. So, based on the available data, the market should resolve to \"Yes.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response correctly identifies the primary source for resolution (ISW map) and uses updates provided in the user prompt to inform its analysis. The response also correctly notes that any temporary glitches in the map are not considered, aligning with the stipulations of the user prompt.\n\nHowever, there are critical issues with the response that need addressing:\n\n1. **Premature Resolution**: The event in question is scheduled for a future date (April 30, 2025), and the current date is March 25, 2025. According to the system prompt instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the response should always return p4 to indicate that the request cannot be resolved at this time. The response incorrectly proceeds to analyze the situation as if the event date had passed.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Event Status**: The response analyzes current and past events to predict the outcome of a future event, which contradicts the directive to report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources as of the current date.\n\nGiven these issues, the response does not meet the required standards for accuracy and adherence to the system prompt instructions concerning the timing of the event. The recommendation of p2 is inappropriate given that the event is still in the future, and the correct response should be p4 until the event date has passed or the situation changes such that a definitive resolution can be made.\n\n**Decision**:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly resolves a future event as if it had already occurred.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Russia will recapture the Sudzha railroad station by April 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution conditions are clear: if any part of the train station icon is shaded red on the ISW map by the deadline, it's a \"Yes\" (p2). If not, \"No\" (p1). There's also an update that if Russia gains control through a negotiated settlement, that counts as \"Yes\" even if the map isn't updated, but actual control must be established, not just an announcement.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of Sudzha and the railroad station. The search results mention that Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in August 2024 [1][8][11]. However, recent reports from March 2025 indicate that Russian forces have retaken Sudzha [2][10][12][15]. The ISW's March 13 assessment states that Russian forces are clearing Sudzha and have seized surrounding areas [15]. The DeepStateMap, an alternative source, also showed Ukrainian forces no longer in control as of March 12 [4].\n\nThe key point is the railroad station. Source [11] from August 2024 mentions Ukraine capturing the Sudzha railway station, which was a strategic point. But by March 2025, Russian forces have reportedly recaptured Sudzha, including the industrial zones and areas around the railway [7][10][15]. The ISW's March 13 report confirms Russian advances into Sudzha and control over key positions [15]. Additionally, the update mentions negotiated settlements; however, there's no evidence of such a settlement here. The recapture seems through military action.\n\nSince the resolution date is April 30, 2025, and the current date in the scenario is March 25, 2025, there's about a month left. However, multiple sources as of mid-March already report Russian control over Sudzha, including the railway station. The ISW map would likely reflect this, but I need to ensure that the station itself is shaded red. Given that Russian forces have consolidated control and the station was a primary target, it's reasonable to conclude they hold it. Unless there's a significant Ukrainian counterattack before April 30, which isn't indicated in the sources, the status is likely to remain. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nRussian forces have recaptured the town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast as of mid-March 2025, including the strategic Sudzha railroad station critical to this market's resolution. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) confirmed Russian advances into Sudzha's industrial zones and residential areas by March 13, with subsequent reports indicating full control[2][10][15]. While ISW's interactive map remains the primary resolution source, alternative tracking by DeepStateMap already reflected Ukrainian withdrawal from Sudzha by March 12[4].\n\nThe railroad station specifically:\n- Was originally captured by Ukraine in August 2024 as a key intelligence target[11]\n- Became a focal point during Russia's March 2025 counteroffensive\n- Fell under Russian control as part of their Sudzha recapture, with geolocated footage showing Russian troops operating in the area[10][15]\n\nNo evidence exists of subsequent Ukrainian counterattacks to retake the station, and Russian forces have been consolidating control through bridge destruction and defensive positioning[14][16]. While the resolution deadline remains April 30, 2025, current battlefield evidence and map assessments suggest Russia already meets the criteria for control. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response should not engage in predictive analysis but rather state that the event is scheduled for the future and thus cannot be resolved currently.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not align with the facts as required by the system prompt. It should verify whether the event has occurred (it has not, as it is scheduled for the future) and recommend p4 accordingly.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response contains a significant error by not returning p4. It also shows a bias towards analyzing and predicting based on current information, which is inappropriate for this task.\n\nGiven these issues, the response is not satisfactory and needs improvement.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Russia will recapture Sudzha's railroad station by April 30, 2025, based on the ISW map. The resolution depends on the station being shaded red by that date. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of Sudzha and the railroad station. The search results mention that by March 12, 2025, Russian forces had recaptured Sudzha. Sources like [1], [2], [5], [6], and [8] all confirm that Sudzha was under Russian control by mid-March. The ISW report from March 12 ([2]) specifically states that Russian forces seized Sudzha and advanced to areas around it, including the industrial zone. \n\nThe railroad station's location is crucial. The user provided a Google Maps link, and the station is on Privokzal'naya ulitsa. Search result [4] from Wikimapia mentions Sudzha's train station at coordinates 51\u00b012'10\"N 35\u00b017'34\"E, which matches the provided location. \n\nNow, checking if the station is shaded red on the ISW map. The ISW's March 12 report ([2]) mentions geolocated footage showing Russian control of Sudzha and surrounding areas. Since the station is within Sudzha, and the entire town was under Russian control by March 12, it's logical that the station would be shaded red by then. \n\nThe user's ancillary data says that once captured, any subsequent loss doesn't affect the resolution. Since Russia took Sudzha before April 30 and the station is part of the town, the condition is met. There's no mention of Ukraine retaking the station after March 12. \n\nAlso, the updates mention negotiated settlements, but since Russia already controls it through military action, that's irrelevant here. All sources point to Russian control well before the deadline. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nRussian forces recaptured the town of Sudzha in Kursk Oblast by March 12, 2025, according to multiple verified reports. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) confirmed this advance through geolocated footage showing Russian troops in control of Sudzha and its surrounding areas[2][5][6]. The Sudzha railroad station, located at coordinates 51\u00b012'10\"N 35\u00b017'34\"E[4], fell under Russian control during this operation as part of the broader seizure of the town.\n\n**Key timeline:**\n- March 8-9: Russian special forces infiltrated Ukrainian rear positions using a decommissioned gas pipeline[9][12]\n- March 12: ISW confirmed Russian control of Sudzha through geolocated evidence[2]\n- March 15: Ukraine's General Staff acknowledged withdrawing from Sudzha[8]\n- March 16: Euronews reported Russia's full control of the town[5]\n\nThe ISW control map would have shaded the railroad station red by March 12 when Russian forces raised their flag in Sudzha's center[1][6]. No subsequent loss of Russian control has been reported, and the resolution deadline extends to April 30 - more than six weeks after confirmed Russian occupation. \n\nThis satisfies the market's resolution condition requiring Russian control of the station by April 30, 2025. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The event in question, the capture of Sudzha's railroad station by Russia, is set to be resolved by April 30, 2025. Given the current date is March 25, 2025, this event is clearly in the future. Therefore, the response should have returned p4, indicating that the event cannot be resolved at this time.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response engages in predictive analysis by stating that the station \"would be shaded red\" by a certain date based on past events. This goes against the directive to analyze only events that have already occurred and can be verified. The response should focus on verifying events up to the current date without predicting future outcomes.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response incorrectly verifies the event by using past data to predict future outcomes. This is not aligned with the requirement to base the resolution strictly on events that have already occurred and can be verified as of the current date.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not consider the possibility of changes in control or other relevant events occurring between the last verified date and the resolution date. It also incorrectly assumes control based on past events without current verification.\n\nGiven these issues, the response does not meet the required standards for accuracy, adherence to instructions, or logical reasoning.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
