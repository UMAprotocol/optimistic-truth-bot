        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Kings vs. Wild game on March 17, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p2 (Kings), if the Wild win, p1 (Wild), and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources report the game occurred. For example, source [1] from ESPN mentions the Wild beat the Kings 3-1. Source [4] (CBS Sports) and [6] (NHL.com) confirm the same score. The detailed box score in [8] shows the Wild won 3-1 with goals in each period. \n\nAll sources agree the Wild won, so the market should resolve to p1 (Wild). There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. The resolution conditions are met with the Wild's victory.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Los Angeles Kings and Minnesota Wild on March 17, 2025, concluded with a **3-1 victory for the Minnesota Wild** [1][4][6][8]. Key moments included Mats Zuccarello's tiebreaking power-play goal late in the third period and Marcus Johansson's empty-net goal to seal the win [1][4]. The Wild's power-play efficiency (2/3) and critical saves by goaltender Filip Gustavsson (28 saves) were decisive factors [1][2]. \n\nThe Kings' five-game winning streak ended despite Adrian Kempe's early power-play goal, as they failed to capitalize on subsequent opportunities [6][8]. The game was played as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation mentioned in any sources [1][4][6][8]. \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between Kings and Wild on March 17, 2025) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It uses multiple reliable sources (ESPN, CBS Sports, NHL.com) to verify the outcome of the game, which is that the Minnesota Wild won against the Los Angeles Kings with a score of 3-1. This outcome aligns with the user's resolution condition where a Wild win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the event date and checking for the occurrence of the game. It then confirms the game's outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The response also checks for any possible postponements or cancellations, which are not applicable as per the sources cited.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome accurately. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Wild win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or significant omissions in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the facts and has not included any predictive or speculative information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
