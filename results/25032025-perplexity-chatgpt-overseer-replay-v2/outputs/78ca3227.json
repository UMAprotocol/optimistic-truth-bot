        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) based on whether Israel initiated a military action against Iran between March 17 and March 21, 2025. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event window has already closed. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any military actions by Israel against Iran within that timeframe. Let's go through the sources. \n\nLooking at source [4], it mentions an Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip on March 18, 2025, but that's against Hamas, not Iran. Source [7] from March 24 talks about a Houthi missile intercepted by Israel, but the Houthis are a Yemeni group, not Iran. Source [8] from March 25 discusses Houthi attacks on Israel and their support for Hezbollah, but again, not direct Israeli action against Iran. \n\nSource [10] from October 2024 mentions Israel preparing a major attack on Iran in response to a missile strike, but that's outside the March 17-21 window. Source [13] from March 23, 2025, reports Iraq complaining about Israel using its airspace to attack Iran on October 26, 2024, which is also outside the specified period. \n\nSources [14] and [16] discuss potential future strikes and preparations but don't report any actual military actions within the required dates. The other sources either discuss past events, like the 2024 Iranian missile barrage, or general tensions without specific actions in the March 17-21 window.\n\nSince none of the search results indicate an Israeli military action against Iran within March 17-21, 2025, and the current date is past the resolution period, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). There's no credible reporting of such an event in the given timeframe.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of available information up to March 25, 2025, there is no verifiable evidence that Israel initiated military action against Iranian soil, airspace, maritime territory, or diplomatic facilities between March 17 and March 21, 2025. Key observations:\n\n- **March 18, 2025 Israeli strikes** targeted Gaza (Hamas) and Lebanon (Hezbollah)[4][12], not Iranian territory or assets.  \n- **Iranian proxy engagements** (Houthi missile launches from Yemen) occurred on March 24[7][8], but these do not qualify as direct Israeli actions against Iran.  \n- **Prior Israeli-Iran clashes** (e.g., October 2024 strikes) fall outside the March 17-21 resolution window[10][13].  \n- **No credible reports** of cyber attacks, sanctions, or diplomatic actions meeting the military action criteria during the specified period[16].  \n\nThe resolution window closed on March 21 without confirmed Israeli military action against Iran as defined.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions by analyzing the specific timeframe (March 17-21, 2025) for any Israeli military action against Iran. The AI correctly identifies that the events mentioned in various sources do not meet the criteria specified in the user prompt (military action on Iranian soil, airspace, or maritime territory).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by systematically checking each source for evidence of military action within the specified dates and correctly concludes that no such action occurred. The AI also correctly identifies the nature of the actions (e.g., actions against Hamas, not Iran) and the dates of these actions to ensure they are outside the specified window.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI effectively verifies that no event matching the user prompt's criteria occurred within the specified timeframe. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) aligns perfectly with the facts presented and analyzed.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI has covered the necessary sources and correctly interpreted the information relevant to the user prompt's requirements.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925660 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:01:00 UTC",
