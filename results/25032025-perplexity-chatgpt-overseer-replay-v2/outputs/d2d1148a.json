        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt said \"Goldberg\" during the next White House press briefing she participated in. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if it's uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any press briefings after the query date. The current date given is March 26, 2025. The search results include a briefing on March 26, 2025, where Leavitt did mention Goldberg multiple times. For example, in source [1], she refers to Jeffrey Goldberg as an \"anti-Trump hater\" and uses his name several times. Similarly, sources [2], [6], [9], [10], [15], and [16] all mention her using \"Goldberg\" during the March 26 briefing. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. The event in question is the March 26 press briefing.\n2. Leavitt participated in this briefing.\n3. She used the term \"Goldberg\" multiple times, both in direct mentions and in possessive forms (like \"Goldberg's wife\"), which according to the resolution conditions, counts as a valid instance.\n\nSince the briefing happened before the December 31, 2025 deadline and she was still the press secretary at that time, the conditions for resolving to \"Yes\" (p2) are met. There's no indication that she ceased her role before the briefing, and the sources confirm her participation and use of the term. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nKaroline Leavitt mentioned \"Goldberg\" multiple times during the March 26, 2025 White House press briefing. She specifically criticized *The Atlantic* editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg by name, calling him an \"anti-Trump hater\" and accusing him of manufacturing hoaxes[1][2][6]. Leavitt referenced Goldberg's reporting on the Signal chat leak involving national security officials[9][10], his political affiliations[1][2], and his journalistic credibility[15][16]. The term \"Goldberg\" was used in both singular and possessive forms (e.g., \"Goldberg's wife\") during her remarks[1][2], which meets the resolution criteria for counting pluralization/possessive forms.\n\nThe briefing occurred before the December 31, 2025 deadline, and Leavitt remained White House press secretary at the time. Video transcripts and multiple news sources confirm her use of the term during this event[1][6][16].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt by focusing on verified facts and concrete evidence from the event, which occurred on March 26, 2025.\n\nThe response effectively verifies the occurrence of the event and confirms that Karoline Leavitt did mention the term \"Goldberg\" multiple times during the briefing. It also correctly applies the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, noting that both singular and possessive forms of the term were used, which aligns with the conditions for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it systematically checks the occurrence of the event, Leavitt's participation, her use of the term \"Goldberg,\" and the timeline requirements. The response also correctly identifies that the event is not scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, thus appropriately resolving the query with a recommendation of p2 (Yes).\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not exhibit any misunderstanding of the event details or the context required for resolution. It strictly adheres to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, ensuring that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the system prompt instructions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the occurrence of the event and correctly applies the resolution conditions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015424 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 18:57:04 UTC",
