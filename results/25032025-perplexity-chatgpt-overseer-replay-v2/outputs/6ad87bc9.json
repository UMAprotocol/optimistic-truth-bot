The ancillary data specifies that if the Pacers win, it's p1; Mavericks win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on March 19. The current date is March 25, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nResult [1] is from the Mavericks' official site and clearly states they lost 135-131 to the Pacers. It details the last-minute turnovers and the Pacers' comeback. That's a strong source. \n\nResult [5] is a Pacers highlight video confirming the same score and mentions Nembhard's game-winning three-pointer. \n\nResult [6] from ESPN's team comparison shows the Pacers' record as 39-29 after the game, which aligns with the win. The Mavericks' record drops to 33-37. \n\nResult [8] is the box score, showing the final score as Pacers 135, Mavericks 131. All these sources consistently report a Pacers victory. \n\nNo sources suggest the game was postponed or canceled. All evidence points to the Pacers winning. Therefore, the resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Indiana Pacers defeated the Dallas Mavericks 135-131 in their March 19, 2025 NBA game at Gainbridge Fieldhouse[1][5][8]. Key details:\n\n**Game Outcome**  \n- Pacers overcame a 7-point deficit in the final 67 seconds with a 34-19 closing run[1]  \n- Andrew Nembhard hit the game-winning three-pointer with 14 seconds remaining[5]  \n- Final box score: Pacers 135 (Pascal Siakam 29 pts, Bennedict Mathurin 23 pts), Mavericks 131 (P.J. Washington 26 pts)[8]\n\n**Key Moments**  \n| Time Remaining | Score | Critical Play |\n|----------------|-------|---------------|\n| 1:07 | Mavs 128-121 | Christie makes 3 FTs[1] |  \n| 0:55 | Mavs 128-125 | Sheppard layup after Hardy turnover[1] |  \n| 0:16 | Pacers 131-130 | Nembhard's go-ahead 3PT[5] |  \n| 0:12 | Pacers 133-130 | Nembhard makes both FTs after Hardy offensive foul[1] |\n\nThe result improved Indiana's record to 39-29 while Dallas fell to 33-37[1][6].

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
