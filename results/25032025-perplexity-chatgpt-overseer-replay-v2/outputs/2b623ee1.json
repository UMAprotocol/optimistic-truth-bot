        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Bryant vs. Michigan State game. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided sources. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 21, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event, so p4 isn't applicable here.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the search results. Looking through the sources, all of them consistently report that Michigan State won the game 87-62. For example, source [1] from Bryant's official site confirms the loss, and sources [2] through [14] all mention Michigan State's victory with the same score. There's no conflicting information about the result. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Michigan State wins, the resolution is p1. Since all sources confirm Michigan State's win, the correct resolution should be p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't an option here. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event details match the user's query. The game mentioned in the query is exactly the one covered in the search results, with the correct teams and date. No discrepancies there. \n\nTherefore, based on the verified outcome and the resolution conditions provided, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between Bryant University and Michigan State University occurred on March 21, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET as scheduled. **Michigan State defeated Bryant 87-62** in the first round of the NCAA Tournament[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Key details include:\n\n- **Final Score**: Michigan State (87) vs. Bryant (62)[1][2][3][4][5][6][7].\n- **Game Progression**: Bryant led early (5-0) and held a 24-21 advantage midway through the first half, but Michigan State closed the half with a 10-0 run to lead 33-28[1][3][4]. The Spartans dominated the second half, outscoring Bryant 54-34[4][7].\n- **Key Performances**:  \n  - Michigan State's Coen Carr scored a career-high 18 points with 9 rebounds[4][5][6].  \n  - Bryant's Rafael Pinzon led all scorers with 21 points[1][2][5][6].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is definitively verified across multiple sources.  \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932625 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:57:05 UTC"
