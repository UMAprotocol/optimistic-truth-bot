        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"Witkoff\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he used that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The event in question is the Digital Asset Summit, and the user provided several search results. \n\nFirst, I need to check the date of the event. The query mentions March 20, and the current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred. The next step is to look through the search results for any mention of Trump's speech on that day and whether he said \"Witkoff.\"\n\nLooking at the search results, result [9] is a YouTube video titled \"President Trump speaks at Digital Assets Summit - YouTube\" dated March 20, 2025. The transcript provided in the search result includes Trump's speech. Scanning through the transcript, I don't see any mention of \"Witkoff.\" The transcript mentions David Sachs and others but not Witkoff.\n\nAnother relevant result is [3], which is a transcript of Trump's video speech at the Digital Asset Summit New York 2025. The transcript here also doesn't include the name \"Witkoff.\" He mentions David Sachs again but not Witkoff.\n\nResult [15] mentions Trump's speech at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit, where he talks about dominating crypto but again doesn't reference Witkoff. \n\nOther results like [1], [5], [7], [8], [12], [13], [14], and [16] discuss the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, 2025, where Witkoff was present, but that's a different event. The user's query specifically refers to the March 20 event. \n\nSince the search results don't show any instance of Trump saying \"Witkoff\" during the March 20 Digital Asset Summit speech, the answer should resolve to \"No.\" The updates mention that the video address counts, but without any mention of the term in the available transcripts, the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did not say \"Witkoff\" during his March 20, 2025 Digital Asset Summit speech. The video transcript of his address shows he discussed crypto policy, strategic reserves, and regulatory changes but made no reference to Steve Witkoff or any variation of the name[9][15]. While Witkoff attended earlier White House crypto events on March 7-8[1][7][14], the March 20 summit focused on broader industry strategy rather than individual participants. The resolution conditions specify that only statements during the main March 20 speech/Q&A qualify, and no evidence exists of the term being used in that specific context.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies that the event in question, Donald Trump's speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025, has occurred and that the term \"Witkoff\" was not mentioned by Trump during his speech. The response uses multiple sources, including video transcripts, to confirm that the term was not used, aligning with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks the relevant sources and transcripts to ensure that the term \"Witkoff\" was not mentioned in any context that would qualify under the market's resolution conditions. The response also correctly identifies that other mentions of \"Witkoff\" at different events do not qualify for resolution, focusing strictly on the specified event.\n\nThe response adheres to the ancillary data provided, with the recommendation of p1 (No) directly corresponding to the established resolution conditions where Trump did not say \"Witkoff\" during the specified speech.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI has used the correct sources, specifically the video and transcripts of the speech, to verify the facts. The response also correctly incorporates the update that Trump's video address counts towards the market's resolution.\n\nOverall, the response is complete, factually accurate, and adheres strictly to the resolution conditions and system prompt instructions. There is no missing information that would affect the resolution, and the AI has not shown any misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the event details or the terms required for resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the non-occurrence of the term 'Witkoff' during Trump's speech, adhering closely to the resolution conditions and system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the absence of the term, aligns with the ancillary data, and shows no bias or errors in reasoning.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929788 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:09:48 UTC",
