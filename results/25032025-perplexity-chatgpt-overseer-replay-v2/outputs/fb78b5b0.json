The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 14 has already happened. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4]) report that Colorado State defeated Utah State 83-72 in the Mountain West Conference semifinals on March 14. \n\nLooking at the details: \n- Source [1] mentions the final score as 83-72 in favor of Colorado State.\n- Source [3] from CBS Sports also confirms the 83-72 score with Colorado State as the winner.\n- Source [2] from Deseret News describes the game's progression, including Colorado State's lead and eventual victory.\n\nAll these sources are consistent in stating Colorado State won. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. The resolution conditions state that a Colorado State win should resolve to p1. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Utah State Aggies faced the Colorado State Rams in the Mountain West Conference Tournament semifinals on March 14, 2025. The game concluded with **Colorado State defeating Utah State 83-72**[1][2][3]. Key details include:\n\n- **Colorado State established a dominant first-half lead** (49-30) behind 64% shooting and nine three-pointers[1][2].\n- Utah State mounted a late 28-12 rally but fell short, cutting the deficit to seven points with 1:34 remaining before CSU secured the win with free throws[1][2].\n- Nique Clifford led Colorado State with 26 points and 11 rebounds[3], while Mason Falslev paced Utah State with 22 points[1].\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation.

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Utah State vs. Colorado State game occurred on March 14, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The response verifies the outcome of the game through multiple sources, confirming that Colorado State won with a score of 83-72. This aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a win by Colorado State corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with the verification of the event date and outcome, followed by a detailed description of the game's progression and key performances. It concludes with a resolution recommendation based on the verified outcome. The reasoning is thorough and considers all necessary details to ensure the resolution is accurate.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, which is a best practice in ensuring the reliability of the information. The alignment of the recommendation with the facts is precise, as the verified outcome directly influences the resolution recommendation of p1, consistent with the ancillary data provided.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt without introducing any irrelevant or unverified information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925123 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:52:03 UTC"
