        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for an NHL game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Boston Bruins scheduled for March 15 at 7:00 PM ET. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is 10 days after the game was supposed to take place. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on the scheduled date. Since the current date is past March 15, the event is in the past. Now, I should verify the outcome of that specific game. The ancillary data specifies that if the Lightning win, it's p2; Bruins win is p1. If postponed, the market stays open, but since the current date is after the scheduled date, I need to check if the game was played or postponed. If canceled, it resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of the Lightning defeating the Bruins 3-1 on March 15. That directly answers the outcome. The Bruins' goalie, Jeremy Swayman, made 27 saves, but the Lightning won. Since the game happened and Tampa Bay won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Lightning). There's no indication of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Boston Bruins 3-1 in their NHL game on March 15, 2025, as scheduled[1]. According to the resolution conditions, a Lightning victory requires the market to resolve to \"Lightning\" (p2). The game was completed without postponement or cancellation, meeting all specified criteria for resolution.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation of the response:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between Tampa Bay Lightning and Boston Bruins) occurred on March 15, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025. The AI checked the outcome of the game and found that the Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Boston Bruins 3-1. This outcome aligns with the user's ancillary data where a Lightning win should resolve to \"p2\". The AI also correctly noted that there was no indication of postponement or cancellation, which would have affected the resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the steps needed to resolve the query: checking the date, verifying the game occurred, confirming the outcome, and aligning the outcome with the specified resolution conditions. The AI's reasoning is clear, direct, and adheres strictly to the facts needed for resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verified that the game took place as scheduled and determined the winner based on reliable information. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"p2\" for a Lightning win is correctly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI did not make assumptions beyond the scope of the verified facts and adhered strictly to the user's resolution conditions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolved the query based on the event's verified outcome and aligned perfectly with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used verified information to make an accurate resolution recommendation without any observable errors or biases.\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908424 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:13:44 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.
