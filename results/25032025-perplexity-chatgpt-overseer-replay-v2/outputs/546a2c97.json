The resolution depends on the official results from the Federal Returning Officer. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the actual vote percentage the Greens received. Looking at the sources, result [1] mentions the Greens got 12%, and result [2] also states they received 12%. Result [12] from the Bundeswahlleiter's final results confirms 11.6% for the Greens. All these sources are consistent, showing the Greens' vote share is below 15%. \n\nSince all reliable sources agree the Greens didn't exceed 15%, the answer should be \"No\". The ancillary data specifies that \"No\" corresponds to p1. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Greens (B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen) received 11.6% of the vote in the 23 February 2025 German federal election according to the final results from the Federal Returning Officer[12]. This falls below the 15% threshold specified in the resolution conditions. \n\n**Key points:**\n- Official results show the Greens' vote share declined from 14.7% in 2021 to 11.6%[1][12]\n- Multiple sources confirm this result within a narrow range (11.6%-12%)[2][5][7]\n- The party's performance ranked fourth behind CDU/CSU (28.5%), AfD (20.8%), and SPD (16.4%)[1][12]\n\nThis outcome reflects both the Greens' diminished political momentum compared to their 2021 peak and the broader shift toward conservative and far-right parties in this election cycle[2][5][6]. The result is definitive and below the required threshold.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that the event in question, the German federal election scheduled for February 23, 2025, has already occurred by the current timestamp of March 25, 2025. It uses the official results from the Federal Returning Officer as the primary source for resolution, which is in line with the user prompt requirements.\n\nThe response provides a detailed analysis of the election results, specifically focusing on the vote share received by the Greens (B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen). It confirms that the Greens received 11.6% of the vote, which is below the 15% threshold specified in the resolution conditions. This information is corroborated by multiple sources, ensuring the factual accuracy of the claim.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it directly addresses the query about whether the Greens won over 15% of the votes. The response concludes with a recommendation of p1, which corresponds to \"No\" as per the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. This recommendation is consistent with the facts presented and the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the proportion of votes won by the Greens and using the official results as the basis for resolution.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906426 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:40:26 UTC"
