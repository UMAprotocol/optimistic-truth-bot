The ancillary data specifies that if Holland wins, it's p1; if Nelson wins, p2; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 22, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The event happened on March 22, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the fight's outcome using the provided sources. Let's look through the search results.\n\nSearch result [2] from fight.tv mentions Kevin Holland's tactical dismantling of Gunnar Nelson and lists him as a winner by unanimous decision. It also notes that Holland received a performance bonus. Result [5] from ufc.com's event page confirms the same, showing Holland won by unanimous decision. Result [6] from cagesidepress.com explicitly states the official result: Kevin Holland def. Gunnar Nelson via Unanimous Decision (29-28\u00d73). Additionally, result [4] from ESPN's fight history for Gunnar Nelson lists the March 22, 2025 fight as a loss to Kevin Holland by unanimous decision. \n\nAll credible sources agree that Holland won the fight. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. Since the event occurred and Holland was declared the winner, the market should resolve to p1 (Holland). The resolution source ESPN (as per ancillary data) is corroborated by the ESPN fight history in result [4], so the information is reliable. No conflicting reports were found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nKevin Holland defeated Gunnar Nelson by unanimous decision (29-28 on all three judges' scorecards) in their welterweight bout at UFC Fight Night 255 on March 22, 2025[2][5][6]. The fight featured Holland effectively defending takedowns while outstriking Nelson, particularly with flying knees and pressure against the fence[6]. Though Nelson attempted multiple grappling exchanges, Holland's submission defense and striking output secured him the victory[2][6].\n\nESPN's official records confirm Holland as the winner[4], and multiple fight recaps from credentialed MMA outlets like Cageside Press and UFC.com corroborate the result[5][6]. The bout concluded without controversy or postponement, meeting all resolution criteria outlined in the ancillary data.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Gunnar Nelson vs. Kevin Holland fight) occurred on March 22, 2025, and the current date is March 25, 2025, which means the event is in the past and can be resolved. The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple credible sources, including ESPN, which is specified in the ancillary data as the resolution source. The response adheres to the instruction to use verified facts and established sources for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with the verification of the event date, followed by a detailed search through credible sources to confirm the outcome. The AI provides a comprehensive summary of the fight's dynamics and outcome, which supports the resolution recommendation. The reasoning is thorough and aligns with the requirements of providing a fact-based, verifiable resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms that Kevin Holland won the fight by unanimous decision, as reported by multiple sources including ESPN, fight.tv, ufc.com, and cagesidepress.com. This verification aligns perfectly with the ancillary data, which states that if Holland wins, the market should resolve to \"p1.\" The AI's recommendation of \"p1\" is therefore fully supported by the verified event outcome.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI effectively uses the specified resolution source (ESPN) and corroborates this information with additional credible sources. The response is unbiased and strictly adheres to the facts as reported by these sources.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns with the verified facts and the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple credible sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909898 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:38:18 UTC"
