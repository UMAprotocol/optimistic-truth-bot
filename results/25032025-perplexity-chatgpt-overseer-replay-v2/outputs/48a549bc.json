The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the NHL game between the New York Islanders and the Los Angeles Kings on March 11, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1 (Kings), if the Islanders win, p2 (Islanders), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 11, so the event date is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [6], [12], [14], [15], [16]) report that the Kings won the game 4-1. For example, source [1] states, \"the Los Angeles Kings beat the New York Islanders 4-1 on Tuesday night.\" Similarly, source [4] mentions the Kings' victory with a score of 4-1, including details about goals by Byfield and Danault. The YouTube video in [16] also confirms the Kings' win with highlights. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports indicate the game took place as planned. The Islanders had two goals disallowed due to goaltender interference, but the final result was a clear Kings victory. \n\nSince the game occurred and the Kings won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Kings). There's no ambiguity here; all sources agree on the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the New York Islanders and Los Angeles Kings on March 11, 2025, concluded with a **4-1 victory for the Kings** at Crypto.com Arena. Multiple sources confirm Phillip Danault and Quinton Byfield scored key second-period goals, while Darcy Kuemper made 33 saves[1][4][12][14]. The Islanders had two goals disallowed due to goaltender interference challenges[6][15], and the Kings\u2019 penalty-kill unit went 8-for-8 while adding two short-handed goals[4][14]. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and resulted in a Kings win, the market resolves to **\"Kings\"** per the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between the Islanders and Kings on March 11, 2025) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). The AI then verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which consistently report a Kings victory. This aligns with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds from verifying the date of the event to confirming its occurrence and outcome. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which are absent, thus correctly applying the ancillary data conditions (p1 for Kings win, p2 for Islanders win, p3 for cancellation).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable and consistent. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Kings win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI does not exhibit any deviation from the facts or the user prompt's instructions.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the specified conditions, and logical consistency in the response, the recommendation appears to be highly accurate and reliable. There is no indication that a retry would yield a different or improved outcome, as the response already meets the required standards of accuracy and completeness.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources, adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data, and logically processes the information without any errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively meets all requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933390 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:09:50 UTC"
