        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"DEI\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she uses the exact term \"DEI\" in any form (including plural or possessive) during the next briefing she participates in before December 31, 2025. If she doesn't hold any briefings by then or is no longer press secretary, it resolves to \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 26, 2025. The next briefing after this date would be the one mentioned in search result [13] and [15], both from March 26, 2025. The user is asking about the \"next\" briefing after the current date, but since the current date is March 26, 2025, and the latest briefings mentioned are on that same day, I need to check if those briefings occurred and if Leavitt used \"DEI\" there.\n\nLooking at the search results, [13] is a video titled \"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a briefing with reporters on Wednesday.\" The date is March 26, 2025. The transcript isn't provided, but the description doesn't mention DEI. Similarly, [15] is another video from the same day, titled \"Karoline Leavitt LIVE: White House Press Secretary Addresses Media Amid Chat Leak Controversy.\" The description mentions a Signal chat leak but not DEI.\n\nHowever, the search results don't include the actual transcripts of these March 26 briefings. The latest detailed transcripts are from February 2025. Without access to the content of the March 26 briefings, I can't confirm if \"DEI\" was mentioned. The user specifies that the resolution source must be video and transcripts of the briefing. Since the provided search results don't include the content of the March 26 briefings, there's no verifiable evidence that she said \"DEI\" during that event.\n\nAdditionally, the user's ancillary data states that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". However, since a briefing did occur on March 26, but we lack the content, the resolution can't be confirmed as \"Yes\". Without explicit evidence from the sources provided, the answer must default to the most probable outcome based on conditions. Since there's no confirmation, and the user requires verifiable sources, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of available information up to March 26, 2025, there is no verifiable evidence that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt used the term \"DEI\" during her March 26, 2025 press briefing. While Leavitt frequently discussed DEI policies in previous briefings[2][9][18], the latest available transcripts and video descriptions from March 26 do not explicitly confirm usage of the term during that specific event[13][15]. \n\nThe resolution conditions require confirmation through official briefing transcripts or video evidence, which are not provided in the search results for the March 26 briefing. Without explicit confirmation from primary sources, the market cannot resolve to \"Yes\" under the specified terms.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"DEI\" during her next White House press briefing is generally well-structured and adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response correctly identifies the need to verify the occurrence of the event and the specific term mentioned, aligning with the user's conditions for resolution. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the system prompt's instructions by focusing on verifying factual information about an event that has already occurred. It correctly identifies the date of the next briefing and attempts to find evidence of whether the term \"DEI\" was mentioned by Karoline Leavitt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The reasoning process is logical, starting from the identification of the event date to the search for transcripts or video evidence. The response acknowledges the lack of direct evidence (transcripts or video content) from the March 26 briefing and therefore cannot confirm the use of the term \"DEI.\"\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly notes that the event took place but lacks the necessary transcripts or video evidence to verify the use of the term \"DEI.\" This aligns with the user prompt's requirement for resolution based on concrete evidence from the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors. It appropriately defaults to the most probable outcome based on the available information and the conditions specified in the user prompt. However, it could improve by explicitly stating that the absence of evidence (transcripts or video mentioning \"DEI\") leads to the recommendation of \"p1\" (No).\n\nGiven the analysis, the response is satisfactory as it adheres to the required factual verification and logical reasoning based on the available information. It correctly concludes with a recommendation of \"p1\" due to the lack of verifiable evidence that \"DEI\" was mentioned in the specified event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the system prompt instructions, logically analyzes the available information, and aligns the recommendation with the facts and conditions provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the available information to make a reasoned decision. It could improve by more explicitly stating the connection between the lack of direct evidence and the recommendation of 'p1'.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
