The ancillary data specifies that if Baylor wins, it's p2; Texas Tech win is p1, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 13 is definitely in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources confirm the game result. Result [2] from NCAA.com shows the final score as Texas Tech 76, Baylor 74. Result [3] from Texas Tech's athletics site details their 76-74 victory, mentioning key players like JT Toppin. Result [4] from Fox Sports also lists the final score as 76-74 in favor of Texas Tech. Additionally, result [5] from KXXV news and [11] from Baylor's own site both confirm the loss to Texas Tech. ESPN's game summary in result [14] and RealGM's box score in [15] further corroborate the Texas Tech win.\n\nAll sources consistently report Texas Tech as the winner with a 76-74 score. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event occurred and Texas Tech won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Baylor vs. Texas Tech men's basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET concluded with **Texas Tech defeating Baylor 76-74** in the Big 12 Championship quarterfinals. The game was played at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, Missouri, as part of the conference tournament[3][5][14]. \n\nKey details from the game:\n- Texas Tech built a 13-point halftime lead (52-39) by making 12 three-pointers in the first half, a Big 12 tournament record[3][11].\n- Baylor mounted a second-half comeback, cutting the deficit to 70-65 with six minutes remaining, but ultimately fell short[3][5].\n- JT Toppin led Texas Tech with 26 points and 10 rebounds, while Baylor's Norchad Omier recorded a season-high 29 points and 14 rebounds[3][11].\n\nThe outcome was verified through multiple sources, including official athletic department reports[3][11], sports networks[4][14], and neutral score-tracking platforms[2][15]. No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in the search results. \n\n**Resolution**: Since Texas Tech won the game, the market resolves to **p1** as defined in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932956 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:02:36 UTC"
