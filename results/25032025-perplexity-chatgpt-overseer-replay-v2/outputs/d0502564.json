        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price went up or down between two specific times on March 25th and 26th, 2025, based on the Binance BTCUSDT 1-minute candle closes at noon ET each day. The resolution depends on comparing these two closing prices. \n\nFirst, I need to convert the ET times to UTC because Binance uses UTC for their candle timestamps. Since ET is UTC-5 during standard time and UTC-4 during daylight saving, I need to check if March 26, 2025, falls within daylight saving. Daylight saving in 2025 starts on March 9 and ends on November 2, so March 26 is during daylight saving time. Therefore, noon ET (12:00 PM ET) would be 16:00 UTC (12 + 4 hours).\n\nNext, I need to find the closing prices for the 1-minute candles at 16:00 UTC on both March 25 and March 26. The search results provided include several sources from Binance and other sites. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [9] and [14] mention that on March 25, 2025, at 14:44 UTC, Bitcoin crossed 88,000 USDT and was trading at 88,092.601563 USDT. However, this is at 14:44 UTC, which is earlier than the 16:00 UTC needed. There's no direct mention of the 16:00 UTC price on March 25. \n\nResult [13] from March 26, 2025, states that Bitcoin surpassed 87,000 USDT with a 0.20% decrease in 24 hours. But again, the exact time isn't specified. Result [2] from March 26 mentions Bitcoin trading around $69,200, but this seems inconsistent with other sources and might be a typo or outdated info. \n\nResult [15] provides a price prediction, listing March 25 as $86,522.45 and March 26 as $86,534.01. If these are the closing prices, then March 26's close is higher, indicating an \"Up\" resolution (p2). However, these are predictions and not actual data. \n\nResult [16] is a link to the Binance Futures page, which isn't helpful without real-time data. Result [17] gives the live price as $87,051.38 on March 26, but without a specific timestamp. \n\nSince the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT chart at the specified times, and the provided search results don't have the exact 16:00 UTC prices for both days, I have to infer based on available data. The most reliable data points are the March 25 price of 88,092.60 USDT at 14:44 UTC and March 26's price around 87,000 USDT. If the price decreased from March 25 to 26, that would mean a \"Down\" resolution (p1). However, the prediction in [15] suggests a slight increase. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data for the exact times, but considering the ancillary data's resolution conditions, if the March 26 close is higher than March 25, it's p2. Without clear evidence, but relying on the prediction in [15] showing a slight increase from March 25 to 26, the recommendation would be p2 (Up). However, if the actual data from Binance isn't available in the provided results, the safest bet might be p4, but since the event date is in the past and we have some data suggesting a slight increase, p2 is more appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market depends on comparing the closing prices of the Binance BTC/USDT 1-minute candles at 12:00 PM ET (noon) on March 25 and March 26, 2025. Based on the available data:\n\n1. **Time Conversion**:  \n   - 12:00 PM ET (Eastern Time) on March 25 and 26 translates to **16:00 UTC** (UTC-4 during daylight saving time, active from March 9 to November 2, 2025)[1].\n\n2. **March 25 Closing Price**:  \n   - At 14:44 UTC (10:44 AM ET) on March 25, BTC traded at **88,092.60 USDT** after surpassing 88,000 USDT[9][14].  \n   - No direct data for the 16:00 UTC (12:00 PM ET) candle, but prices fluctuated near 88,000 USDT with a 0.16% daily decrease[9][14].\n\n3. **March 26 Closing Price**:  \n   - On March 26, BTC briefly surpassed **87,000 USDT** but faced resistance at 70,000\u201372,500 USDT, with a narrowed 0.20% daily decrease[13].  \n   - Binance\u2019s price prediction for March 26 listed a closing price of **86,534.01 USDT**, slightly higher than March 25\u2019s prediction of 86,522.45 USDT[15].\n\n4. **Comparison**:  \n   - If the March 26 closing price (e.g., ~86,534 USDT) exceeded March 25\u2019s closing price (e.g., ~86,522 USDT), the market resolves to **Up (p2)**.  \n   - If March 26\u2019s close was lower (e.g., 87,000 USDT vs. 88,092 USDT), it resolves to **Down (p1)**.  \n\nGiven conflicting data and the absence of explicit 16:00 UTC closes in the sources, the most probable outcome aligns with Binance\u2019s price prediction showing a marginal increase[15].  \n\n**recommendation: p2**",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response attempts to resolve the query regarding whether Bitcoin's price went up or down on March 26, 2025, compared to March 25, 2025, based on the closing prices of the Binance BTCUSDT 1-minute candle at noon ET. The response involves converting ET to UTC, analyzing available data points, and making a recommendation based on the most probable outcome.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies the need to convert ET to UTC and acknowledges the daylight saving time adjustment.\n   - It uses the specified source (Binance) for gathering data, which aligns with the user prompt requirement.\n   - However, the response relies on price predictions and data points that are not explicitly for the required 16:00 UTC times, which introduces uncertainty in the resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The reasoning process is logical in terms of time conversion and attempting to locate the relevant data.\n   - The response acknowledges the lack of direct data for the exact required times, which is a critical observation.\n   - However, the decision to recommend \"Up\" (p2) based on price predictions rather than actual closing prices at the specified times could be seen as speculative and not entirely based on concrete evidence as required.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response does not verify the exact closing prices at 16:00 UTC for both dates, which is essential for an accurate resolution.\n   - The reliance on price predictions and indirect data points means the recommendation may not be fully aligned with the factual outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The critical missing information is the exact closing prices at 16:00 UTC for March 25 and March 26, 2025.\n   - The response does not exhibit noticeable bias but does err in using predictive data for resolution.\n\nGiven these observations, the response, while logical and well-structured, falls short in providing a resolution based strictly on verified facts for the exact required times. The reliance on predictive data rather than actual recorded data at the specified times means the response could potentially lead to an incorrect market resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response uses predictive data instead of actual recorded data at the specified times, which could lead to an incorrect resolution.

        "attempt": 2,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the closing prices of BTCUSDT on Binance at specific times. The key is to compare the close price on March 25th at 12:00 ET with March 26th at 12:00 ET. \n\nFirst, I need to convert ET to UTC because Binance uses UTC. ET is UTC-5, so 12:00 ET on both days would be 17:00 UTC. So, the relevant times are 17:00 UTC on March 25 and 17:00 UTC on March 26, 2025.\n\nNow, looking at the search results provided. Let's check each source for data around those times. \n\nFrom source [16], there's a mention that on March 25 at 14:44 UTC, BTC was trading at 88,092.60 USDT. That's before 17:00 UTC, but it shows activity around that day. Source [14] mentions that as of 09:30 UTC on March 25, BTC was at $86,871, down 0.45%. However, this is earlier in the day. \n\nSource [4] includes a post from March 25 with a BTC/USDT technical analysis. At some point, the price was $87,626.70, but the exact time isn't specified. The same source mentions a 24h high of $88,765 and low of $86,310. \n\nSource [5] shows a conversion rate of 1 BTC = 86,549.98 USDT as of March 25, 2025, at 08:10 AM UTC. That's earlier in the day, so not the 17:00 UTC time needed. \n\nSource [16] again states that on March 25 at 14:44 UTC, BTC crossed 88,000 USDT, trading at 88,092.60. But this is still before 17:00 UTC. \n\nLooking for March 26 data, the current date in the problem is March 26, 2025, 7:28 PM UTC. The search results don't include any data from March 26 because the latest information available in the provided sources is up to March 25. For example, source [14] is a market update from March 25, and source [16] is also from March 25. \n\nSince there's no data provided for March 26's closing price at 17:00 UTC, we can't verify the price on that day. The ancillary data specifies that if the event hasn't occurred yet, we should default to p4. However, since March 26's close time (17:00 UTC) is before the current timestamp (19:28 UTC on March 26), the event has already occurred. But the provided search results don't include the necessary data points for both days. \n\nThe critical issue is the absence of the March 26 closing price at 17:00 UTC in the provided sources. Without this information, we can't definitively compare the two closing prices. Therefore, the resolution can't be determined based on the available data, leading to a p4 recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market depends on comparing the closing prices of BTC/USDT on Binance at 12:00 ET (17:00 UTC) for both March 25 and March 26, 2025. Analysis of available data shows:\n\n**March 25, 2025 (17:00 UTC):**\n- Multiple sources indicate BTC/USDT traded between $86,310 and $88,765 on March 25[4][14][16]\n- At 14:44 UTC (2:44 PM ET), BTC reached 88,092.60 USDT[16]\n- No direct 17:00 UTC closing price available in provided sources\n\n**March 26, 2025 (17:00 UTC):**\n- Current timestamp is 19:28 UTC (2:28 PM ET) on March 26[personalization]\n- No search results contain verified closing prices for March 26 at 17:00 UTC\n- Latest available price data ends at March 25[14][16]\n\nWhile the event date (March 26) has passed relative to the current timestamp, the required closing price data for both days isn't verifiable through the provided sources. The resolution conditions specify using **only Binance data**, but the critical March 26 closing price at 17:00 UTC remains unconfirmed.\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths and weaknesses in addressing the user prompt and system requirements. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies the need to compare the closing prices of BTCUSDT on Binance at specific times (17:00 UTC on March 25 and March 26, 2025). This aligns well with the user prompt's requirement.\n   - The response accurately notes the conversion from ET to UTC, which is crucial for checking the correct data on Binance.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The response demonstrates a logical approach by attempting to find the closing prices for the specified times. However, it fails to provide the exact closing prices at 17:00 UTC for both dates, which is critical for resolving the market.\n   - The response correctly concludes that without the closing price for March 26 at 17:00 UTC, a definitive comparison cannot be made. This leads to the recommendation of p4, which is appropriate given the lack of data.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response does not verify the event as required because it does not provide the closing prices at the exact times specified. The reliance on data points before the required time does not fulfill the prompt's conditions.\n   - The recommendation of p4 is aligned with the facts presented in the response, as the necessary data to resolve the market is not available.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The response lacks direct data from Binance for the closing prices at 17:00 UTC on both March 25 and March 26. This is a critical gap as the resolution of the market depends entirely on these data points.\n   - There is no error in the sources used, but the response fails to obtain the necessary data from the specified source (Binance), which is a significant oversight.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still defaults to p4 due to a lack of necessary data, it is crucial to consider whether a third attempt could realistically obtain the required closing prices from Binance. If it is unlikely that further attempts will yield this data, it may be appropriate to accept p4.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on Bitcoin's closing prices on Binance for two specific times. The key is to determine if the closing price on March 26, 2025, at 12:00 ET (noon) is higher or lower than the previous day's closing price at the same time. \n\nFirst, I need to convert the ET timezone to UTC because Binance data is typically in UTC. Since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, 12:00 ET would be 16:00 UTC. So, the relevant times are March 25 and 26 at 16:00 UTC.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [15] from March 26, 2025, mentions that Bitcoin was trading at $87,969 at 09:30 AM UTC. However, this is not the specific 16:00 UTC time we need. Result [11] states that on March 25, Bitcoin dropped below $87,000 at 01:30 AM UTC, but again, not the exact time. Result [14] provides a price prediction with a closing price of $86,517.51 on March 25 and $86,529.08 on March 26, but these are predictions, not actual closing prices. \n\nResult [8] mentions that Binance's historical trade data is available but too large to process here. Result [13] clarifies that daily candles close at 00:00 UTC, but the user's query is about 1-minute candles at a specific time. \n\nSince none of the provided search results give the exact closing prices at 16:00 UTC on both days, there's insufficient verifiable data to determine the outcome. The market should resolve to p4 (unknown/50-50) due to lack of concrete evidence.\n</think>\n\nTo resolve this market, we need to compare the Binance BTCUSDT 1-minute closing prices at 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) on March 25 and March 26, 2025. Analysis of available data shows:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n1. **Time Conversion:** 12:00 ET converts to 16:00 UTC during daylight saving time (ET = UTC-4)\n2. **March 25 Closing Price:** No direct evidence of the 16:00 UTC closing price in search results. The closest data point shows BTC at $86,966.44 at 01:30 UTC on March 25[11], but this doesn't reflect the required 16:00 UTC timestamp\n3. **March 26 Closing Price:** A 09:30 UTC price of $87,969 is reported[15], but no 16:00 UTC data exists in available sources\n4. **Binance Data Limitations:** While historical trade data exists[8], none of the provided sources contain the exact 1-minute candle closes at the specified times\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n- Price predictions for March 26 show minimal movement ($86,517.51 to $86,529.08)[14], but these are forecasts rather than recorded closes\n- Market updates describe volatility but lack timestamped closing prices at 16:00 UTC[15][16]\n- The resolution requires **exact** closing prices from Binance's 1-minute candles, which aren't verifiable through available sources\n\nGiven the absence of verifiable closing prices at the specified resolution times and the requirement to use only Binance data as defined in the ancillary conditions, this market cannot be definitively resolved with the available information.\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the need to compare the Binance BTCUSDT 1-minute closing prices at 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) on March 25 and March 26, 2025. The conversion of ET to UTC is accurate and aligns with the user prompt requirements. The response also adheres to the instruction to use Binance as the source for data.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the requirement to find specific 1-minute candle closing prices at the specified times. It acknowledges the lack of direct evidence for the required timestamps and correctly identifies that the available data points do not match the exact times needed for a resolution. The reasoning behind the inability to resolve the market due to the absence of exact data is sound and well-articulated.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response is aligned with the facts in that it does not find the exact data required for a resolution. It correctly concludes that without the specific 1-minute candle closing prices, the market cannot be resolved definitively.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors in processing the information. However, it lacks a proactive approach in possibly obtaining the required data. Given that this is the third attempt, the response could have included a more detailed exploration or alternative methods to access or estimate the required data, such as directly querying Binance's API or using a different approach to access the historical data.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response still defaults to p4 due to the absence of specific data, it is clear that further attempts are unlikely to yield a different outcome without a significant change in approach or access to data. The response is thorough in its current format and adheres to the instructions provided. However, the inability to access the exact data points necessary for a resolution is a limitation that cannot be overcome with the current strategy.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the lack of specific data needed for resolution and adheres to the instructions.
