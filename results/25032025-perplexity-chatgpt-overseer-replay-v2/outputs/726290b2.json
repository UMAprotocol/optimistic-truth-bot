        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether Trump sanctioned Venezuela between March 18 and March 21, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if new sanctions were imposed during that period. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any sanctions announced in that timeframe. Let's look through the sources. \n\nLooking at the dates on the search results: \n\n- Source [1] is from March 25, 2025, mentioning an Executive Order signed on March 24. That's after the March 21 deadline, so it's outside the window. \n\n- Source [3] also refers to the March 24 EO. Same issue. \n\n- Source [5] is March 24, again discussing the tariff announcement on that date. \n\n- Source [7] and [8] both cover the March 24 EO. \n\n- Source [10] is a fact sheet from March 25, 2025, detailing the tariffs imposed on the 24th. \n\n- Source [12] is March 25, mentioning the tariff threat on the 24th. \n\n- Source [14] is March 25, discussing the tariff announcement. \n\nOther sources like [2], [6], [9], [11] are from January or early March but don't fall within March 18-21. \n\nThe key point here is the date of the Executive Order. The EO was signed on March 24, which is after the specified period (March 18-21). Even though the EO was announced on March 24, the user's query specifically asks for sanctions imposed between March 18 and 21. None of the search results indicate any sanctions within that window. \n\nThe ancillary data also mentions that the passage of an official act authorizing sanctions within the timeframe counts as a \"Yes\". However, the EO was signed on March 24, which is outside the period. Therefore, there's no evidence of sanctions or official acts within March 18-21. \n\nThus, the resolution should be \"No\", corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether the United States imposed new sanctions against Venezuela between March 18 and March 21, 2025. According to the search results, **no sanctions or official acts targeting Venezuela were announced or implemented during this specific timeframe**.  \n\nThe earliest relevant action occurred on **March 24, 2025**, when President Trump signed an Executive Order imposing a 25% tariff on countries importing Venezuelan oil[1][3][5][7][10][12][14]. While this tariff qualifies as a sanction under the ancillary data\u2019s definition, it falls outside the March 18\u201321 window specified in the query.  \n\nNo other sanctions or executive actions targeting Venezuela\u2019s government or officials are reported in the search results for March 18\u201321, 2025. Earlier sanctions from January 2025[2][6] and March 4\u20135, 2025[9][11] also do not fall within the required dates.  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to \u201cNo\u201d (p1), as no qualifying sanctions were imposed during the specified period.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event in question (imposition of sanctions on Venezuela by the U.S.) did not occur within the specified timeframe of March 18 to March 21, 2025. The response correctly notes that the relevant Executive Order was signed on March 24, 2025, which is outside the specified date range. This shows adherence to the user prompt's requirement to focus on the specified dates.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the information from various sources, confirming that no sanctions were imposed during the specified period. It correctly concludes that actions taken outside of this period do not meet the criteria set by the user prompt. The reasoning is clear, and the response thoroughly checks multiple sources to ensure no relevant event was missed.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies that the event (sanction imposition) did not occur within the required timeframe. It aligns its recommendation with this fact, suggesting a resolution of \"No\" (p1), which matches the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The AI has focused strictly on the event's specific timeframe and conditions as outlined in the prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985344 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:35:44 UTC",
