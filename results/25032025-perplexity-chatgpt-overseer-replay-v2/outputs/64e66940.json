The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 23) is in the past. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] from golobos.com states that New Mexico lost to Michigan State 71-63 in the NCAA second round on March 24, 2025. The article details the game, confirming the result. Similarly, [2] from clickondetroit.com also reports Michigan State's 71-63 victory, advancing to the Sweet 16. \n\nOther sources like [4], [5], [6], [7], and [8] all corroborate the same score and outcome. The Spartans won, and multiple sources confirm this. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All reports indicate the game was played as scheduled. \n\nSince the event happened, and Michigan State won, the resolution should be p1. The ancillary data maps p1 to Michigan State, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between New Mexico and Michigan State occurred as scheduled on March 23, 2025, with Michigan State winning 71-63[1][2][4][5][6][7][8]. Multiple sources confirm the Spartans overcame a 10-point first-half deficit, using key plays from Jaden Akins (16 points) and Tre Holloman (14 points) to secure their 16th Sweet 16 appearance under coach Tom Izzo[4][5][8].

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909467 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:31:07 UTC"
