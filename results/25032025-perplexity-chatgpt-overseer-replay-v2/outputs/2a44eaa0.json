        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the UFC Fight Night event between Marvin Vettori and Roman Dolidze that took place on March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Dolidze wins, it's p1; if Vettori wins, p2; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 15, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome of the fight. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] (Wikipedia) lists the main event result as Roman Dolidze defeating Marvin Vettori by unanimous decision (49\u201346, 49\u201346, 49\u201346). \n- Source [2] (Athlon Sports) confirms Dolidze won via unanimous decision with scores 49-46, 48-47, 48-47.\n- Source [6] (Combat Press) also states Dolidze won by unanimous decision with all three judges scoring 49-46 in his favor.\n- Other sources like [4] and [7] had predictions but the actual results are consistent across the event coverage.\n\nSince the fight took place on March 15, 2025, which is before the current date, and multiple credible sources (Wikipedia, Athlon Sports, Combat Press) report Dolidze as the winner, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled. All sources agree on the outcome, so the market should resolve to Dolidze (p1).\n</think>\n\nThe UFC Fight Night: Vettori vs. Dolidze 2 event occurred on March 15, 2025, at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas. The main event featured a middleweight rematch between Marvin Vettori and Roman Dolidze.  \n\n**Outcome of the Bout**  \nRoman Dolidze defeated Marvin Vettori via **unanimous decision** (49\u201346, 49\u201346, 49\u201346) [1][6]. Judges scored all five rounds in favor of Dolidze, who controlled the fight with aggressive striking and clinch work. While Vettori had moments of success, including a knockdown, Dolidze\u2019s consistent output and precision secured the victory [2][6].  \n\n**Resolution Conditions**  \n- **p1 (Dolidze)**: Triggered as Dolidze was declared the winner.  \n- The fight occurred as scheduled, and no postponement, cancellation, or draw was reported.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (UFC Fight Night: Vettori vs. Dolidze 2) and the date it occurred (March 15, 2025). It correctly states that Roman Dolidze won the fight by unanimous decision, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions. The sources cited (Wikipedia, Athlon Sports, Combat Press) are appropriate and reliable for verifying the outcome of a sports event. The response adheres to the instruction to resolve based on past events and verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the sources to conclude that Dolidze won, which triggers the resolution condition p1 (Dolidze). It correctly ignores any irrelevant outcomes like a draw or cancellation since the fight occurred and was decided. The reasoning is sound, and the response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple credible sources. It aligns the recommendation (p1) with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a win by Dolidze.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The information provided is relevant and directly addresses the user prompt's requirements.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
