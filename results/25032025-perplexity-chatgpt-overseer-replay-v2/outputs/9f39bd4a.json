        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Colorado vs. Houston college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Houston wins, it's p1; if Colorado wins, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 13) is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, there are multiple sources confirming the game happened. For example, source [1] from big12sports.com reports that Houston beat Colorado 77-69 in the Big 12 Championship Quarterfinal on March 13. Similarly, source [9] from cubuffs.com mentions the game ended 77-68 in favor of Houston. There's a slight discrepancy in the scores (77-69 vs. 77-68), but both agree that Houston won. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. Source [12] talks about a softball game being postponed, but that's unrelated. Source [8] discusses a postponed game from 2018, which is irrelevant here. All other sources about the March 13 game confirm it was played as scheduled. \n\nLooking at the resolution conditions, since the game was played and Houston won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed in the relevant sources. Even though there were injuries during the game (like J'Wan Roberts in source [17]), the game was completed. \n\nTherefore, based on the evidence from the search results, the correct resolution is p1 (Houston).\n</think>\n\nThe Colorado vs. Houston men's college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET was played as planned, with No. 2 Houston defeating Colorado 77-68[1][9][17]. Key details confirming the outcome:\n\n- **Game occurred on schedule**: Multiple sources confirm the March 13 quarterfinal matchup took place at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City[1][9][13].\n- **Houston victory**: The Cougars won 77-68[9][17], extending their winning streak to 11 games[1]. Emanuel Sharp (19 points) and Milos Uzan (14 points) led Houston's scoring[17].\n- **No postponement/cancellation**: While other events like a Houston softball game were postponed[12], this basketball game faced no delays. Play concluded despite injuries to Houston's J'Wan Roberts and Colorado's Sebastian Rancik[15][17].\n- **Market resolution**: Per the ancillary data, the market resolves to \"Houston\" (p1) as the game concluded with their victory.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

It uses multiple sources to cross-verify the information, which strengthens the credibility of the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through reliable sources and aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Houston win) directly with the facts and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information and focuses solely on the event in question as per the system prompt's requirements.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928311 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:45:11 UTC"
