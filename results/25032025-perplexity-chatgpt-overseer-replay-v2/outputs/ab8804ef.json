        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Christian Leroy Duncan vs. Andrey Pulyaev fight at UFC Fight Night on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Duncan wins, it's p2; if Pulyaev wins, p1; and if it's a draw or unresolved by April 22, 2025, it's p3 (50-50). The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the fight date, so the event has already occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the fight's outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] from ESPN lists Andrey Pulyaev's fight history. His most recent fight on March 22, 2025, is marked as a loss (L) to Christian Leroy Duncan by unanimous decision. That's a direct indication that Duncan won.\n\n- Source [5] is a YouTube transcript detailing the fight. It describes Duncan dominating the match, controlling each round with effective strikes and clinch work, leading to a unanimous decision victory. This corroborates the result from ESPN.\n\n- Source [8] from MMA Decisions explicitly states that Christian Leroy Duncan defeated Andrey Pulyaev by unanimous decision with scores of 30-27, 30-26, and 30-27 from the judges. This is a clear confirmation.\n\nOther sources like [3], [4], and [6] provide pre-fight analysis and event listings, but the post-fight results in [1], [5], and [8] are conclusive. Since the fight occurred on March 22, 2025, and the result is verified by multiple credible sources (ESPN, Sherdog, MMA Decisions), the resolution should be p2 (Duncan) as per the ancillary data. There's no mention of a draw or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on Duncan's victory, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nChristian Leroy Duncan defeated Andrey Pulyaev by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-26, 30-27) in their middleweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Edwards vs. Brady on March 22, 2025[1][8]. The fight lasted all three rounds, with Duncan controlling the pace through effective leg kicks, clinch work, and unorthodox strikes like spinning elbows[5]. Judges scored every round in favor of Duncan, who improved his UFC record to 11-2-0, while Pulyaev fell to 9-3-0 in his promotional debut[1][8].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907140 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:52:20 UTC"
