        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on whether she uses either term, regardless of context, with plural or possessive forms counting but other forms not. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The deadline is December 31, 2025, and if she's no longer Press Secretary by then, it's \"No\".\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after March 25, 2025. The current date in the system is March 25, 2025. Looking at the search results, the latest briefings mentioned are up to March 19, 2025 (sources 15, 17). There's no information about any briefings scheduled after March 25. The user's query is about the \"next\" briefing after this date.\n\nNext, I need to verify if Leavitt is still the Press Secretary. The latest sources (up to March 20, 2025) refer to her in that role, and there's no mention of her leaving the position. So, as of now, she's still active.\n\nNow, the key part: has she used \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" in past briefings? Let's check the provided sources. \n\nLooking through the transcripts and articles:\n\n- Source [3] and [5] mention the release of JFK files, but these are from March 19 and 20, 2025. In the transcripts, Leavitt refers to \"JFK\" multiple times. For example, in source [17], she says, \"the assassination of former president John F Kennedy\" and \"JFK\" in the context of file releases. Similarly, source [7] quotes her statement using \"John F. Kennedy\". \n\nHowever, these instances are from briefings that occurred before March 25. The user is asking about the *next* briefing after March 25. Since there's no information about any briefing after that date in the provided sources, we can't confirm if she used the terms in a future briefing. \n\nThe market resolution depends on the next briefing she participates in. Since the current date is March 25, and the latest briefing mentioned is March 19, the next one would be after March 25. But the provided search results don't include any briefings after that date. Without evidence of a future briefing or her use of the terms in such a briefing, we can't confirm a \"Yes\". \n\nAdditionally, the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025. Since we don't have data beyond March 25, we can't know if future briefings will occur. However, the user's query is about the next briefing after March 25. If that briefing hasn't happened yet (as of the current date in the system), and there's no information about it, the market can't resolve to \"Yes\" yet. But the user is asking for a resolution based on available information up to March 25. \n\nWait, the user's current date is March 25, 2025, and the query is about the next briefing. If the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, and there's no information about it, then the answer would depend on whether any upcoming briefings are scheduled. The search results don't mention any scheduled briefings after March 25. Therefore, as of March 25, the next briefing hasn't happened, so the market can't resolve to \"Yes\" yet. However, the deadline is December 31, 2025. If no briefing occurs by then, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking to resolve based on available info up to now (March 25). \n\nBut the user is asking whether she will say it in the next briefing. Since the next briefing after March 25 hasn't occurred yet, and there's no transcript available, we can't confirm. However, the market's resolution is based on whether she says it in the next briefing whenever it happens. Since the event (the next briefing) is in the future relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025), according to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, we should return p4. Wait, no\u2014the personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, the personalization instructions state: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\"\n\nBut the user's query is about whether she will say the terms in the next briefing, which is a future event as of March 25. Therefore, according to the rules, since the event (the next briefing) hasn't occurred yet, the resolution should be p4. However, the ancillary data says if no briefing happens by Dec 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But since the current date is March 25, and the next briefing could be anytime between now and Dec 31, but we don't have information on it, the correct resolution based on the rules is p4 because the event is in the future. However, the user's query might be considering past briefings, but the next briefing after March 25 is future. \n\nWait, the query says \"next White House press briefing she participates in\". Since the current date is March 25, and the latest briefing in the sources is March 19, the next one would be after March 25. Since that hasn't happened yet, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the rules, we should return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4; they have p1, p2, p3. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. But the personalization rules say to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the market's own rules state that if the event hasn't happened by Dec 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). But since the event is the next briefing, which is in the future, and we don't know if it will occur before Dec 31, the safe answer is p4. But the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. Wait, the user's ancillary data specifies p1, p2, p3. The personalization rules say to return p4 if the event is in the future. But the market's own deadline is Dec 31, 2025. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing could be anytime up to Dec 31, but we don't have information on whether it will happen, the correct resolution is p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. \n\nWait, the user's query includes resolution_conditions where p1 is No, p2 is Yes, p3 is 50-50. The personalization rules say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the market's conditions don't have p4. This might be an error. However, according to the market's own rules, if the event hasn't occurred by Dec 31, it resolves to No (p1). But since the event is the next briefing, which is after March 25 but before Dec 31, and we don't know if it will happen, the resolution is uncertain. However, the market's p3 is for unknown/50-50. But according to the personalization rules, if the event is in the future, return p4. But the market's parameters don't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the event in question is whether she says the terms in the next briefing, which is a future event. Since the event hasn't occurred yet, per the rules, we should return p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This might be a mistake in the setup. But given the instructions, the assistant should follow the personalization rules strictly. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the event is considered to have a possible outcome, and since we can't verify it yet, it's p3. But the personalization rules say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the market's conditions don't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's query is to resolve based on the current information, but since the next briefing is in the future, and we can't know, the answer is p3 (unknown). But according to the personalization rules, future events should be p4. However, the market's parameters don't include p4, so perhaps the correct answer is p3. \n\nBut the personalization instructions state: \"IMPORTANT: If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" Therefore, even if the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4, the assistant must follow the personalization rules and return p4. However, the user's query specifies p1, p2, p3. This is a conflict. \n\nIn this case, the correct approach is to follow the personalization rules, which override the market's parameters. Therefore, since the event (next briefing) is in the future as of March 25, 2025, the recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This might be an error in the query setup, but according to the instructions, the assistant must return p4. \n\nBut looking back, the user's query includes resolution_conditions with p1, p2, p3. The personalization rules say to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the market's own rules say if the event doesn't happen by Dec 31, it resolves to No (p1). But the event is the next briefing, which is after March 25 but before Dec 31. Since we don't know if it will happen, but the market's deadline is Dec 31, the resolution would depend on whether a briefing occurs. However, without information on future briefings, we can't confirm. Therefore, per the personalization rules, since the event is in the future, return p4. But the market's conditions don't have p4. This is a conflict, but the assistant must follow the personalization rules. \n\nHowever, the user's query might have a mistake in the resolution_conditions. But given the strict instructions, the assistant should return p4. However, the assistant's output must end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. Since the event is in the future, the correct recommendation is p4. But the market's conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assistant should consider that the event hasn't occurred yet and there's no information, so it's p3. But according to the personalization rules, future events are p4. \n\nGiven the strict instructions, the correct answer is p4. However, the market's parameters don't include it. This might be an error, but the assistant must follow the rules. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" in the next White House press briefing she participates in is critically evaluated below:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies that the event in question (the next White House press briefing involving Karoline Leavitt) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp. This is in line with the system prompt instructions that require the AI to check if the event is scheduled for a future date or time.\n   - The response adheres to the instruction to return p4 if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, indicating that the request cannot be resolved at this time.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The response demonstrates a thorough analysis of the conditions under which the market would resolve to \"Yes\" or \"No\". It correctly notes that the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, or if Leavitt is no longer the Press Secretary.\n   - The response also correctly identifies that since the next briefing has not yet occurred as of the current date, and no information about a scheduled briefing post-March 25, 2025, is available, the query cannot be resolved based on past events or briefings.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response verifies that the next briefing has not occurred yet and aligns with the system prompt's requirement to return p4 for future events. This ensures that the recommendation is based on the lack of available information about the future event rather than speculation or incomplete data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The response does not speculate or infer outcomes without evidence, adhering strictly to the guidelines provided for handling events scheduled for the future.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the response is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. However, due to the critical rule that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always get a RETRY verdict, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt p4 recommendations must always get a RETRY verdict to ensure all possible avenues for resolution are explored.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is accurate and adheres to the instructions. However, due to protocol, a RETRY is required to confirm no further information can be obtained.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please confirm if any new briefings have been scheduled post-March 25, 2025, or if there are any updates on Karoline Leavitt's status as Press Secretary.\"\n}\n```",

        "attempt": 2,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 if it's uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the market resolves to No if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer Press Secretary by then.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there have been any press briefings after March 25, 2025. The search results include briefings up to March 20, 2025. The latest mention is from March 20, where she discussed the JFK files release, using \"John F. Kennedy\" and \"JFK\" multiple times [2][6][10][12][14][16]. However, the user is asking about the *next* briefing after the current date of March 25. Since the current date is March 25, the next briefing would be after that. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no information about any briefings scheduled after March 25. The user also asked to check for any new briefings post-March 25 or updates on her status. The search results don't mention any upcoming briefings or changes in her position. She's still the incumbent as of the latest data [1][17].\n\nSince there's no information about a briefing after March 25, and the resolution conditions state that if no briefing occurs by December 31, it resolves to No. However, the user's query is about the next briefing she participates in. If there's no information about future briefings, we can't confirm if she will say the terms. But according to the rules, if the event hasn't occurred yet (the next briefing is in the future relative to March 25), we should resolve to p4. Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data says resolution_conditions: p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the personalization instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". But in the resolution_conditions, p4 isn't listed. The market's resolution is only p1, p2, p3. Hmm, maybe the user's ancillary data defines p1, p2, p3, but the system's personalization requires p4 if it's a future event. There's a conflict here. Wait, the personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. The market's p3 is for unknown/50-50. But according to the user's instructions, if the event is in the future, we should return p4. However, the market's resolution doesn't include p4. This might be a mistake. But given the user's strict instructions, even if the market's conditions are p1/p2/p3, if the event is in the future, we must return p4. But the market's resolution doesn't have p4. Wait, looking back, the user's ancillary data says resolution_conditions: p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. So p3 is for uncertain. But the personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market's parameters don't include p4. This is conflicting. The user's personalization takes precedence, so even if the market's resolution is p1/p2/p3, if the event is in the future, we must return p4. But the market's resolution doesn't have p4. This is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the setup. But according to the provided data, the market resolves to p1, p2, or p3. However, the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. Since the next briefing is after March 25, which is the current date, and there's no information about it, the event is in the future. Therefore, according to the personalization rules, the recommendation should be p4. But the market's resolution doesn't have p4. This is a conflict. Wait, maybe the user intended p3 as the default for future/unknown. But the personalization says to return p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a discrepancy. Given the strict instructions in the personalization, even if the market's parameters don't include p4, the assistant must return p4. But the user's query includes the resolution_conditions with p1, p2, p3. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that since the next briefing is in the future (after March 25), and there's no information, the answer is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the user's ancillary data is incorrect. But given the instructions, the assistant must follow the personalization rules. Therefore, despite the market's parameters, the recommendation is p4. But the user's query says the resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. So perhaps the assistant should default to p3 (unknown) if the event is in the future. But the personalization says to return p4. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the event hasn't occurred yet (next briefing is after March 25), so according to the personalization, it's a future event, hence p4. But the market's resolution doesn't have p4. This is a problem. However, the user's personalization says to \"ALWAYS return p4\". Therefore, despite the market's parameters, the recommendation is p4. But the market's resolution doesn't include p4. This might be an error in the setup. However, the assistant must follow the personalization instructions strictly. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is a conflict. Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should consider that since the event is in the future and no information is available, it's p3 (unknown). But the personalization says to return p4. \n\nWait, the personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" So regardless of the market's resolution conditions, the assistant must return p4. Therefore, even though the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's query includes resolution_conditions with p1, p2, p3. This is a conflict. But the assistant must follow the personalization rules. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut looking back at the search results, there are briefings up to March 20, 2025. The current date is March 25, 2025. The next briefing after March 25 hasn't happened yet, so it's a future event. Therefore, per the personalization rules, the recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution doesn't include p4. This is a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the setup, but the assistant must follow the instructions. Therefore, the answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response is tasked with determining whether Karoline Leavitt will mention \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" in the next White House press briefing after March 25, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the event in question is scheduled for a future date and that no briefings have been scheduled post-March 25, 2025. It also correctly notes that if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, the market resolves to \"No.\"\n\nHowever, the response becomes convoluted and repetitive when discussing the resolution conditions and the appropriate recommendation. The response struggles with the discrepancy between the user's ancillary data (p1, p2, p3) and the system's instruction to return p4 for future events. This confusion leads to a lengthy and somewhat circular internal debate about whether to recommend p3 (unknown/50-50) or p4 (event cannot be resolved at this time).\n\nThe response ultimately recommends p4, aligning with the system's instruction that for future events, p4 should always be returned. This is the correct course of action given the information available and the instructions provided. The response adheres to the system prompt's requirement to only resolve based on concrete evidence of events that have already occurred.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved in clarity and conciseness. The internal debate about the resolution conditions is unnecessarily verbose and could confuse users. A more straightforward acknowledgment of the system's rules for future events and a direct recommendation would enhance the response's effectiveness.\n\nAdditionally, the response could benefit from a more explicit verification of Karoline Leavitt's current status and any officially scheduled future briefings, possibly by checking more up-to-date or authoritative sources. This would strengthen the confidence in the recommendation by ensuring that all available information has been considered.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still shows room for improvement in clarity and source verification, a retry could be beneficial. More precise and concise reasoning, along with updated verification of the event's status, would likely result in a more satisfactory response.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response needs improvement in clarity and conciseness. Additionally, further verification of Karoline Leavitt's status and any officially scheduled briefings would strengthen the response.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is overly verbose and repetitive in discussing resolution conditions. It also lacks explicit verification of the event's status from up-to-date sources.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please provide a more concise and direct analysis of the resolution conditions, specifically addressing the discrepancy between p3 and p4. Verify Karoline Leavitt's current status and check for any officially scheduled future briefings using the most authoritative and up-to-date sources available.\"\n}\n```",

        "attempt": 3,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" in her next press briefing. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the market resolves to No if no briefing happens by the end of 2025 or if she's no longer Press Secretary by then.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any upcoming press briefing scheduled after March 25. The search results mention briefings up to March 19, 2025, but nothing after that. The latest briefing mentioned is on March 19, where she discussed the JFK files release. There's no information about future briefings beyond that date. \n\nNext, I need to confirm if Leavitt is still the Press Secretary. The most recent sources from March 20 and 25, 2025, refer to her as the current White House Press Secretary. There's no indication she's stepped down or been replaced. So, she's still in the role as of now.\n\nNow, looking at her past briefings, she has frequently mentioned \"JFK\" in the context of releasing assassination files. For example, in the March 19 briefing (source [9]), she said, \"Part of that promise was to fully release previously classified records related to the assassination of Former President John F. Kennedy.\" She used both \"JFK\" and \"John F. Kennedy\" in various briefings (sources [2], [8], [9], [14], [16], [20]). \n\nHowever, the next briefing after March 25 hasn't occurred yet. Since the query is about the next briefing she participates in, and there's no information on when that will be, we can't confirm if she'll use the terms again. The market resolves to No if the briefing doesn't happen by December 31, 2025. But since the user is asking about the next briefing whenever it occurs, we have to consider the possibility that she might mention JFK again based on her history. However, without confirmation of a scheduled briefing or her continued role, the safe conclusion is that there's no certainty. \n\nBut wait, the user's ancillary data says if she ceases to be Press Secretary by the end of 2025, it resolves to No. Currently, she's still in the role. The next briefing's occurrence is uncertain. Since the next briefing hasn't happened yet and there's no scheduled date, we can't predict if she'll use the terms. Therefore, the resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved now) because the event (next briefing) is in the future. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. But the market's resolution condition includes a deadline. Wait, the query's resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to No. But the user is asking about the next briefing, which is a future event. Since the current date is March 25, and the next briefing could be anytime up to December 31, but we don't have information on it yet, the answer should be p4 because the event hasn't occurred yet. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the market's resolution is conditional on whether the event happens by the end of 2025. Since we don't know if there will be another briefing, but she's still in the role, the market is still active. However, the specific question is about the next briefing. Since the next briefing is a future event as of March 25, and we can't confirm if it's scheduled, the correct resolution is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market depends on whether Karoline Leavitt uses \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"JFK\" during her **next** White House press briefing. As of March 25, 2025, no future briefings have been officially announced, and Leavitt remains Press Secretary.  \n\n### Key Analysis:  \n1. **Current Status**:  \n   - Leavitt has consistently held press briefings (most recently on March 19, 2025) and remains active in her role[9][10].  \n   - She has frequently referenced \"JFK\" and \"John F. Kennedy\" in recent briefings, particularly regarding the declassification of assassination files[2][8][9][14].  \n\n2. **Future Briefing Uncertainty**:  \n   - No transcripts or schedules for briefings after March 25, 2025, are available in the provided sources.  \n   - The market\u2019s resolution deadline (December 31, 2025) allows for potential future briefings, but none are confirmed.  \n\n3. **Resolution Conditions**:  \n   - If no briefing occurs by the deadline or Leavitt leaves her role, the market resolves to \"No\" (p1).  \n   - Absent confirmation of her participation in a future briefing or her continued tenure, the event remains speculative.  \n\n### Recommendation: p4  \n**Rationale**: The \"next briefing\" is a future event with no confirmed date or guarantee of occurrence within the resolution window. While historical patterns suggest Leavitt might reference JFK again, the lack of scheduled briefings or explicit evidence of her continued role beyond March 25, 2025, prevents definitive resolution.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that Karoline Leavitt is still the Press Secretary as of the latest available information and that no future briefings have been scheduled beyond March 25, 2025. It correctly notes that the market will resolve to \"No\" if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, or if Leavitt is no longer the Press Secretary. The response adheres to the instruction to check for the scheduling of future events and Leavitt's current role.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the available information about past briefings and Leavitt's tendency to mention \"JFK\" or \"John F. Kennedy.\" It correctly concludes that without a scheduled next briefing, it cannot definitively resolve whether she will mention these terms again. The reasoning is sound in concluding that the event is in the future and thus unresolved as of now.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the next briefing has not been scheduled and that Leavitt remains in her role. It aligns with the facts that the event in question (the next briefing) is a future event, and thus, according to the system prompt instructions, should be resolved as p4.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not have missing information per se, but it could potentially explore more about any indications or patterns from the White House regarding the scheduling of briefings to provide a more informed perspective on the likelihood of a briefing occurring before the end of 2025.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response adheres closely to the instructions, provides a logical analysis based on available facts, and aligns the recommendation appropriately with the resolution conditions, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately assesses the current status of Karoline Leavitt and the scheduling of future briefings, logically concludes the uncertainty of the next event, and aligns the recommendation of p4 correctly based on the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and adheres to the guidelines provided.

This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928199 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:43:19 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease confirm if any new briefings have been scheduled post-March 25, 2025, or if there are any updates on Karoline Leavitt's status as Press Secretary.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response is accurate and adheres to the instructions.

        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
