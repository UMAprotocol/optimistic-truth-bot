The ancillary data specifies that if BYU wins, the market resolves to \"BYU\" (p2), and if Wisconsin wins, it resolves to \"Wisconsin\" (p1). If the game is postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened three days ago. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([6], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]) report that BYU won the game 91-89. For example, source [6] states, \"BYU withstood a ferocious charge from Wisconsin's John Tonje to hold off the Badgers for a 91-89 victory.\" Similarly, source [10] mentions, \"BYU outruns Wisconsin 91-89 in NCAA Tournament.\" These consistent reports across different reputable outlets confirm that BYU was the winner.\n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the 50-50 resolution doesn't apply. All sources indicate the game was completed as scheduled. Therefore, according to the ancillary data, since BYU won, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe BYU vs. Wisconsin NCAA Tournament game occurred on March 22, 2025, as scheduled. Multiple verified sources confirm that **BYU defeated Wisconsin 91-89** in a closely contested matchup[6][10][11][12][13][14][15]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was determined by the final score. \n\nBased on the ancillary data specifying resolution to \"BYU\" (p2) for a BYU victory, the market should resolve accordingly. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through reliable sources, and it aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the date of the event and confirms that it is in the past relative to the current timestamp. It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event using multiple sources, which consistently report a BYU victory. This approach adheres to the instructions to base the resolution on verified facts and established outcomes.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the conditions set forth in the ancillary data, matching the outcome of the game (BYU win) with the correct resolution parameter (p2). It also correctly dismisses the possibilities of the game being postponed or canceled, as there is no evidence to suggest either scenario occurred.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple reputable sources, ensuring the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The alignment of the recommendation (p2 for a BYU win) with the ancillary data is precise and correct.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question, as required, and does not introduce irrelevant information or assumptions.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of facts, adherence to the system prompt instructions, and logical alignment of the recommendation with the ancillary data, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns the recommendation correctly with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively meets all required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742920888 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:41:28 UTC"
