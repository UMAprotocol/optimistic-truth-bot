        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Northwestern vs. Minnesota game on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Northwestern wins, it's p2; Minnesota, p1; postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 12 has already happened. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, all of them (1,2,3,5,6,8) report that Northwestern defeated Minnesota 72-64 in the Big Ten Tournament opener. For example, source [1] states Northwestern won 72-64, and source [8] from ESPN confirms the same score. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game took place on March 12. \n\nSince the event occurred and Northwestern won, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nNorthwestern defeated Minnesota 72-64 in their Big Ten Tournament First Round game on March 12, 2025[1][2][3][5][6][8]. The Wildcats led for nearly the entire game, using a 10-0 second-half run to secure their first conference tournament win since 2022[1][2]. Nick Martinelli starred with 28 points and seven rebounds[1][2][3], while Ty Berry (14 points) and Jordan Clayton (11 points) provided key support[1][3]. Minnesota's Dawson Garcia scored 22 points but couldn't prevent the Golden Gophers from losing five of their final six games[3][5][8].\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled on March 12 with no postponements or cancellations mentioned in any sources[1-8]. According to the resolution conditions, since Northwestern won decisively, the market should resolve to their designated outcome. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Northwestern vs. Minnesota game occurred on March 12, 2025, and that Northwestern won the game with a score of 72-64. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Northwestern win corresponds to a resolution of p2. The response adheres to the system prompt by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the game was neither postponed nor canceled.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It correctly concludes that since Northwestern won, the market should resolve to p2. The response is thorough in detailing the game's key moments and performances, which supports the credibility of the sources and the final outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using multiple sources. It aligns the recommendation (p2) directly with the ancillary data provided, which specifies that a Northwestern win should resolve as p2.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome and aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
