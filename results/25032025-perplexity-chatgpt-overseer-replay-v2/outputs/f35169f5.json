The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Carolina Hurricanes vs. Philadelphia Flyers game scheduled for March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hurricanes win, it's p2; Flyers win, p1; postponed stays open; canceled resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 15, so the event date is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources (1,5,9,10,12,13,14) report that the game took place on March 15. The Hurricanes won 5-0. For example, source 5 mentions the Hurricanes' 5-0 victory, and source 9 confirms the score with a shutout by Kochetkov. \n\nNext, check if there's any mention of postponement or cancellation. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. There's no info about the game being canceled or postponed. The Flyers' official recap (source 12) even details the periods and stats, confirming the game occurred. \n\nSince the game was played and the Hurricanes won decisively, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information found. All sources align on the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Carolina Hurricanes defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 5-0 in their March 15, 2025 NHL game[1][5][9][10][12][13]. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation. The Hurricanes secured a shutout victory, extending their win streak to seven games[5][9][10], while the Flyers suffered their sixth loss in seven games[12][13]. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: 5-0 Hurricanes[5][9][10]\n- Pyotr Kochetkov recorded a 26-save shutout[5][9]\n- Mark Jankowski scored two goals for Carolina[5][9][12]\n- The game was played at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia as planned[14]\n\nSince the game was completed without cancellation or postponement, and the Hurricanes won decisively, the market resolves to **\"Hurricanes\"** per the ancillary terms. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
