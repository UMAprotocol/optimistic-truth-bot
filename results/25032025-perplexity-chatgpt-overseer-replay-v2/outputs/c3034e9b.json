        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Biden\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the market resolves to No if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer press secretary by then.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there have been any press briefings after March 25, 2025. The latest search result provided is from March 25, 2025, which is the same as the current date. The user's query is about the \"next\" briefing, so I need to determine if there's information about briefings after this date. However, all the search results are from before or on March 25, 2025. The most recent mention is a video from March 25, 2025, where Leavitt discusses demographics and Trump's attendance at an event, but there's no transcript provided for that specific briefing. \n\nLooking at the ancillary data, the market resolves based on the next briefing she participates in. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the user is asking about the next briefing after this date, but the provided search results don't include any briefings after March 25, there's no evidence yet of her mentioning \"Biden\" in a briefing after this date. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, it resolves to No. However, the user is asking about the next briefing, which hasn't occurred yet as of the current date. Without information on future briefings, we can't confirm if she will say \"Biden.\" \n\nMoreover, the search results show that Leavitt has frequently criticized the Biden administration in past briefings, often referring to \"the Biden administration\" when discussing previous policies. For example, in the February 12, 2025 briefing [17], she mentions the \"Biden administration's mismanagement.\" However, since the query is about future briefings, past behavior isn't sufficient to guarantee future mentions. \n\nThe user's query is time-sensitive. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet, there's no way to verify if \"Biden\" will be mentioned. Therefore, based on the provided information and the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p4 (cannot be resolved at this time) because the event in question (the next briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp. Even if a briefing is imminent, until it occurs and is documented, we can't confirm the outcome. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event is in the future, resolve to p4. Since the next briefing is a future event as of March 25, 2025, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question, Karoline Leavitt saying \"Biden\" during the next White House press briefing, is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp of March 25, 2025. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that it cannot resolve the query based on events that have not yet occurred and therefore recommends p4, indicating that the query cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nHowever, according to the critical rule provided in the evaluation guidelines, if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a RETRY verdict must be issued. This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining relevant information are exhausted before concluding that the query cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nThe response is factually accurate in its assessment of the situation based on the information available up to the current date. It logically concludes that without evidence of a briefing after March 25, 2025, and without any information on future briefings, it cannot confirm whether Karoline Leavitt will mention \"Biden\" in the next briefing. The response also correctly aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies how the market should resolve under different outcomes.\n\nHowever, the response could potentially improve by exploring additional sources or methods to determine if there is any scheduled briefing after March 25, 2025, or any indication from reliable sources that might suggest the likelihood of Karoline Leavitt mentioning \"Biden\" in the next briefing.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Biden\" during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. The key here is to check if there's a scheduled briefing before the deadline and whether she's still the press secretary. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The deadline is December 31, 2025. So there's still time for briefings to occur. The next step is to look for any information about upcoming briefings. The search results provided mention briefings up to March 17, 2025, and March 25, 2025. The latest one from March 25, 2025, is about the autopen controversy where Leavitt mentions Biden. However, the user is asking about the \"next\" briefing after the query date. \n\nWait, the current date in the system is March 25, 2025, and the latest briefing mentioned is on that same day. The user's query is about the next briefing after this date. Since there's no information in the search results about any briefings scheduled after March 25, 2025, we can't confirm if there will be another one before the deadline. Also, the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to \"No\". \n\nAdditionally, the ancillary data specifies that if Leavitt ceases to be press secretary before the deadline, it also resolves to \"No\". The search results don't indicate any changes in her position; she's still active as of March 25. However, without confirmation of a future briefing, we can't predict if she'll say \"Biden\" in one. \n\nLooking at past behavior, Leavitt frequently references Biden in her briefings, as seen in the transcripts. For example, on March 25, she mentioned Biden regarding the autopen issue. But the next briefing's occurrence isn't confirmed. Since the market requires the next briefing to happen and her participation, and there's no info on future schedules, the safe resolution is \"No\" because we can't verify that the event (the next briefing) will occur. Even though she has a pattern of mentioning Biden, without a confirmed upcoming briefing, the answer defaults to \"No\". \n\nAlso, the user's additional guidance mentions checking for updated schedules, but the provided search results don't include any. Therefore, based on the available information, the recommendation is p4, which corresponds to \"No\" in this case.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Biden\" during her next White House press briefing. Based on the provided search results and resolution conditions:\n\n1. **Current Status of Press Briefings**:  \n   The most recent press briefing documented in the search results occurred on **March 25, 2025** [10][13], where Leavitt addressed questions about President Trump\u2019s claims regarding Joe Biden\u2019s use of an autopen for pardons. During this briefing, she explicitly referenced Biden in the context of questioning his awareness of the pardons:  \n   > *\"The president [Trump] was raising the point, did the president [Biden] even know about these pardons? Was his legal signature used without his consent or knowledge?\"* [10][13].  \n\n   This confirms that Leavitt **did say \"Biden\"** during the March 25 briefing. However, the query specifically asks about the **next** briefing after the current timestamp (**March 25, 2025, 1:19:52 PM UTC**).  \n\n2. **Future Briefings**:  \n   There is no information in the search results about a scheduled press briefing after March 25, 2025. The resolution conditions state that if no briefing occurs by **December 31, 2025**, the market resolves to \"No\" [Ancillary Data].  \n\n3. **Leavitt\u2019s Tenure**:  \n   The search results confirm Leavitt remains White House press secretary as of March 25, 2025, with no indication of her leaving the role [6][10][13].  \n\n4. **Historical Context**:  \n   Leavitt has consistently criticized Biden in past briefings, including on **January 28** (blaming Biden for inflation and egg prices) [1][9], **February 12** (accusing Biden of economic mismanagement) [2][4], and **March 17** (attributing the Russia-Ukraine war to Biden\u2019s policies) [3]. This pattern suggests a high likelihood of her mentioning Biden in future briefings if they occur.  \n\n### Resolution  \n- The **March 25 briefing** already occurred and included a reference to Biden, but the query pertains to the **next** briefing after the current timestamp.  \n- Without confirmation of a future briefing or evidence that Leavitt will cease her role, the resolution defaults to **p4** (\"No\") under the ancillary conditions, as the event (next briefing) has not yet occurred and cannot be verified.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths but also some critical areas that need improvement to fully satisfy the requirements of the UMA optimistic oracle system.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the current date and the deadline for the event. It also accurately notes that the query pertains to the next briefing after March 25, 2025, and correctly applies the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data. However, the response fails to adhere strictly to the instruction that if the event is scheduled for a future date or has not occurred yet, it should return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Instead, the response concludes with a recommendation of p4 based on the assumption that no future briefing is scheduled, which is not supported by the data provided.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically connects the lack of scheduled future briefings with the resolution condition that if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, the market resolves to \"No\". However, the response lacks completeness as it does not explore or confirm whether there are indeed no future briefings scheduled beyond March 25, 2025. It assumes the absence of information as confirmation of no future events, which is a logical fallacy.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not verify whether a future event is scheduled or not. It assumes that because there is no information available in the provided data about future briefings, none are scheduled. This is a critical oversight because the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The response should have sought to verify whether additional briefings are scheduled beyond the current date.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response is biased towards the information that is immediately available and does not seek additional sources that could confirm the scheduling of future briefings. This is a significant error as it leads to a potentially incorrect resolution recommendation.\n\nGiven these observations, the response needs improvement. Specifically, it should seek additional information to confirm whether or not future briefings are scheduled beyond March 25, 2025. If no such briefings are scheduled, the response should then align with the ancillary data to recommend p4. If briefings are scheduled, it should withhold resolution until those events occur or more information becomes available.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response assumes no future briefings are scheduled without verifying this information, which could lead to an incorrect resolution.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Biden\" during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The resolution conditions are clear: if she says \"Biden\" in any form (including plural or possessive), the answer is Yes (p2). If not, it's No (p1). If there's no briefing by the end of 2025 or she's no longer press secretary, it's No. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after March 25, 2025. The current date given is March 25, 2025. The search results include briefings up to March 17, 2025 (source 5 and 8). The latest mention of a future event is in source 3, where a Cabinet meeting was scheduled for February 26, 2025, but that's in the past now. There's no information in the search results about any briefings scheduled after March 25. \n\nNext, I need to verify if Leavitt is still the press secretary. All the sources up to March 17, 2025, mention her in that role, and there's no indication she's stepped down. So, as of the current date, she's still active.\n\nSince the next briefing hasn't happened yet and there's no information on future briefings, the market can't be resolved as Yes or No based on past events. The user's additional guidance emphasizes checking for any updates or announcements about future briefings. The provided search results don't mention any upcoming briefings post-March 25. \n\nThe ancillary data states that if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, it resolves to No. But since the query is about the \"next\" briefing, and we don't know when that will be, the resolution depends on whether that future event happens. However, based on the available information, there's no evidence of a scheduled briefing after the current date. \n\nTherefore, without confirmation of a future briefing and given the lack of information, the recommendation should be p4, which indicates the event hasn't occurred yet and can't be resolved at this time. The previous response was p4, but the user wants a retry to ensure thorough checking. After re-examining all sources, there's still no data on future briefings, so p4 remains correct.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market depends on whether Karoline Leavitt uses the term \"Biden\" in her next press briefing. Analysis of available evidence shows:\n\n**Key factors:**\n1. **No future briefings confirmed**: The latest press briefing transcript available is from March 17, 2025[5][8], with no announcements of upcoming briefings in the search results. The White House calendar shows a cabinet meeting occurred on February 26[3], but no press briefings beyond March 25 are documented.\n\n2. **Historical precedent**: In previous briefings:\n   - Leavitt frequently criticized the \"Biden administration\" (11 instances across 7 briefings)[1][2][3][6][10][11][13]\n   - Used phrases like \"Biden's mental incompetence\"[8][13] and \"Biden administration's mismanagement\"[6]\n   - Explicitly named \"Joe Biden\" 4 times in documented transcripts[8][10]\n\n3. **Pattern of engagement**: The Trump administration maintains a consistent strategy of contrasting current policies with the \"previous administration\"[3][6][13], making future references to Biden likely though not guaranteed.\n\n**Critical considerations:**\n- The administration's media strategy emphasizes criticizing Biden-era policies[1][10][15]\n- Leavitt has shown willingness to attack Biden personally[8][11]\n- No policy changes appear to limit this rhetorical approach\n\n**Recommendation**: p4  \n*Rationale*: While historical patterns suggest a high probability of Biden references, the specific \"next briefing\" hasn't occurred yet and isn't confirmed in available sources. Without verification of the event's occurrence or content, resolution remains pending.",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and verification of the event. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question (Karoline Leavitt saying \"Biden\" during a press briefing) has not yet occurred as of the current date, March 25, 2025. It adheres to the instruction to check for future events and correctly concludes that no future briefings are scheduled beyond this date based on available information.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows from the lack of scheduled future briefings to the conclusion that the market cannot be resolved at this time. It also correctly maintains that Karoline Leavitt is still the press secretary as of the last available information. The response includes a thorough check of sources up to the current date, which is a strong point in its reasoning.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that no future briefings are scheduled as of the current date and aligns with the ancillary data that if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, the market resolves to \"No.\" However, since the event is about the \"next\" briefing and its occurrence is uncertain, the recommendation of p4 (event hasn't occurred yet and can't be resolved) is appropriate and aligns with the facts.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors in its analysis. It is based on the information available up to the current date and makes a reasonable effort to check for future events. However, the response could potentially explore more about any announcements or changes in the administration's schedule that might not be captured in the sources it checked. This could include checking more dynamic sources like official social media or direct White House announcements.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response has adhered to the instructions, verified the lack of future events effectively, and logically reasoned based on the available information, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the instructions, logically concludes based on available information, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the facts. No future briefings are scheduled as of the current date, and the response has thoroughly checked available sources.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-reasoned. It could potentially explore more dynamic and immediate sources for any last-minute scheduling changes, but this is not strictly necessary given the completeness of the current analysis.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nThis evaluation concludes that the response is satisfactory and no further attempts are required.",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908597 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:16:37 UTC",
