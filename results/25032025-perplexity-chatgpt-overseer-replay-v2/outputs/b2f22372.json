        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ontario will resume the electricity surcharge to the U.S. by March 21, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Ontario announces a resumption by that date. The resolution source is official announcements from the Ontario government.\n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events from the search results. The surcharge was initially announced on March 10, effective immediately. Then, on March 11, Ontario suspended the surcharge after discussions with the U.S. Commerce Secretary. The key point here is that the suspension happened on March 11, and the user is asking if it will be resumed by March 21. \n\nLooking at the sources, after March 11, there's no mention of Ontario reinstating the surcharge again before March 21. The latest date in the search results is March 12, where Trump halts doubling tariffs after Ontario backs off. The sources [4], [6], [9], and [12] all confirm that Ontario suspended the surcharge on March 11, and there's no indication of any resumption by March 21. \n\nSince the resolution depends on official announcements from Ontario, and there are no sources indicating a resumption by the deadline, the answer should be \"No\". The market should resolve to p1. Also, the current date in the system is March 25, 2025, which is after March 21, so any events after March 21 wouldn't affect the resolution. Therefore, based on the provided information, the answer is No.\n</think>\n\nOntario suspended its 25% surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, Minnesota, and New York on March 11, 2025, following negotiations with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick[2][9][12]. This suspension occurred in response to President Donald Trump's threat to double steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%[4][6][11]. The Ontario government's decision was part of a broader agreement to discuss trade issues under the USMCA framework, with no subsequent announcements of reinstatement before the March 21 deadline[9][12][13].\n\nThe resolution source for this market is official announcements from the Ontario government. No evidence exists in the search results of any official statement from Ontario authorities resuming the surcharge by March 21, 2025. The suspension remained in effect through the resolution period, with no reinstatement actions documented[2][9][12].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's requirement to determine if Ontario will resume the electricity surcharge to the U.S. by March 21, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the resolution source should be official announcements from the Ontario government and confirms that no such announcements were made by the deadline.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the timeline of events, noting the suspension of the surcharge on March 11, 2025, and the lack of any announcements about its reinstatement by March 21, 2025. The reasoning is sound and well-supported by the cited sources, which confirm the absence of any action to resume the surcharge within the specified timeframe.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event (suspension of the surcharge) occurred and checks for any subsequent events that would change the status (resumption of the surcharge). Since no resumption occurred by the deadline, the recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) is correctly aligned with the facts and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or missing information in the response. The response strictly focuses on the information relevant to the query and uses appropriate sources to confirm the absence of a resumption announcement.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the factual situation and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, logically analyzes the situation based on verified facts, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the factual information and conditions specified.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm the absence of any announcement regarding the resumption of the surcharge, leading to a correct resolution recommendation.\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907571 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:59:31 UTC"
