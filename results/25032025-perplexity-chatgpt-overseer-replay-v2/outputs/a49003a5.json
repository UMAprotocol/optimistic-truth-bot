        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Kari Lake will be a member of the Trump administration based on the given resolution conditions. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if Trump wins the 2024 election and nominates or appoints her by March 31, 2025. First, I need to confirm if Trump won the 2024 election. The search results mention Trump as president-elect in several articles from December 2024, so that's a check. \n\nNext, I need to check if Kari Lake was officially nominated or appointed. The sources from December 2024 [1][4][7][9][12] state that Trump announced Lake as his pick for director of Voice of America (VOA) and potentially as ambassador to Mexico. However, the VOA director position isn't a direct presidential appointment but is selected by a board. But in February 2025, source [2][13] mentions she was named a senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is part of the Trump administration. \n\nThe resolution conditions mention that nominations count even if not confirmed. Her role as a special adviser in USAGM, announced officially, qualifies as an appointment within the administration. The deadline is March 31, 2025, and the current date is March 25, 2025, so the appointment happened before the cutoff. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and Kari Lake has been officially appointed to a role within his administration. On February 27, 2025, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) announced Lake\u2019s appointment as a **senior adviser** to help implement Trump administration policies[2][13]. This followed Trump\u2019s December 2024 announcement of his intent to have her lead Voice of America (VOA)[4][7][9][12], though the VOA director role requires board approval, which remains pending[13].\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that nominations or appointments by Trump before March 31, 2025, qualify for a \u201cYes\u201d resolution, even if unconfirmed. Lake\u2019s senior adviser role at USAGM\u2014a federal agency under the Trump administration\u2014constitutes a formal appointment[2][13]. Additionally, she was publicly named as a contender for ambassador to Mexico[1][11], though no official nomination for that role has been confirmed.\n\nGiven the criteria, Lake\u2019s confirmed USAGM advisory position meets the resolution conditions for a \u201cYes\u201d outcome[2][13].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response uses verified facts to establish that Kari Lake's appointment as a senior adviser at the U.S. Agency for Global Media qualifies her as a member of the Trump administration, adhering to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds through the necessary checks - confirming Trump's election victory and Lake's appointment. It provides a thorough explanation of why her appointment meets the resolution conditions, even though her potential role as VOA director remains unconfirmed. The response also mentions her consideration for the ambassador role to Mexico, adding depth to the analysis but correctly focusing on the confirmed appointment for resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event (Lake's appointment) against the timeline and conditions provided in the user prompt. It aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts that have been established, showing a clear understanding of the event in question and the specific terms required for resolution.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931996 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:46:36 UTC",
