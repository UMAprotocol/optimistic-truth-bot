The user wants to know if Texas A&M will make the 2025 Final Four, with the market resolving to \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on their advancement. The ancillary data specifies that if the team is eliminated, it resolves to \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the current status of Texas A&M in the NCAA tournament. The search results include several articles about their games. Looking at the dates, the most recent articles are from March 22, 2025. Result [2] and [5] both mention that Texas A&M lost to Michigan in the second round on March 22, ending their season with a 23-11 record. Specifically, result [2] states, \"The Texas A&M men's basketball team's 2024-25 season ended as the Aggies could not hold off a furious rally by the Michigan Wolverines, falling 91-79 in NCAA Tournament second round action on Saturday inside Ball Arena.\" This clearly indicates that Texas A&M was eliminated in the second round.\n\nSince the Final Four is a later stage of the tournament, and the team has already been eliminated, they cannot advance further. The resolution conditions state that if the team is eliminated, the market resolves to \"No\" (p1). There's no ambiguity here because the sources confirm their elimination. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nThe Texas A&M Aggies men's basketball team was eliminated from the 2025 NCAA Tournament in the second round after losing 91-79 to the Michigan Wolverines on March 22, 2025[2][5][9]. This loss ended their season with a 23-11 record[2][9], making it impossible for them to advance to the Final Four.  \n\nKey details from the elimination game:  \n- Michigan overcame a 10-point second-half deficit with a 15-2 run in the final 6:41[5][9]  \n- Texas A&M went scoreless for six minutes during Michigan's decisive rally[2][9]  \n- The Aggies' season concluded in the second round for the second consecutive year[2]  \n\nAs the team was officially eliminated before reaching the regional semifinals (Sweet 16), this market resolves to \"No\" per the ancillary data's elimination clause.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response is based on verified facts, specifically the outcome of the NCAA tournament game in which Texas A&M was eliminated. This factual outcome aligns perfectly with the conditions set forth in the user prompt for resolving the market to \"No.\"\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI correctly identifies that the event in question (Texas A&M's participation in the 2025 NCAA March Madness) is relevant and has already occurred. It verifies the outcome of Texas A&M's last game in the tournament, confirming their elimination, which directly impacts the resolution of the market. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the details of the game and Texas A&M's performance, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information provided.\n\nThe recommendation of \"p1\" (No) is correctly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which states that the market should resolve to \"No\" if Texas A&M is eliminated from the tournament. The response meticulously adheres to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the event's outcome as it pertains to the market resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI does not attempt to predict or speculate but rather reports on the definitive outcome as required. The response is factual, straightforward, and devoid of unnecessary details that do not pertain to the resolution of the query.\n\nGiven the thoroughness, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the query based on verified facts and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the outcome of the relevant event and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934438 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:27:18 UTC"
