        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"woke\" during his Education Event on March 20, 2025, when he signed the executive order. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and reports from the event. Let's look through the search results for any mention of Trump using the word \"woke\" during that specific event.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- Result [2] is a YouTube video transcript from NBC4 News on March 20. The transcript mentions Trump signing the order and talking about protecting certain programs but doesn't include the word \"woke.\"\n  \n- Result [3] is another YouTube transcript from NTD Evening News. It quotes Trump saying the Department of Education's budget is exploding while student performance isn't improving. He mentions preserving key programs but again, no \"woke\" here.\n\n- Result [16] is a MarketScreener article. It reports Trump's comments at the event about returning education to the states and shutting down the department. No mention of \"woke.\"\n\n- Result [17] is a video transcript of Trump's speech at the event. He talks about teachers and states taking over education. The quoted parts don't include \"woke.\"\n\n- Result [18] from CT Mirror includes the executive order text, which refers to the department as a \"public relations office\" but doesn't use \"woke.\"\n\n- Result [19] from News9 mentions the event and the executive order but doesn't note any use of \"woke.\"\n\n- Result [20] from KULR8 discusses the order scaling back the department but again, no mention of \"woke.\"\n\nOther results like [5], [6], [7], [13], [14] discuss Trump's broader stance against \"woke\" policies in education, but these are general statements, not from the specific event on March 20.\n\nThe key point is whether he used the word during that particular event. None of the direct transcripts or reports from the event mention him saying \"woke.\" While he has criticized \"woke\" ideologies in education in other contexts (as seen in results [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]), those are not part of the March 20 event.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, there's no evidence Trump said \"woke\" during the specified event. The resolution should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment with the facts provided in the user prompt. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the user prompt's instructions by focusing solely on whether Donald Trump used the word \"woke\" during the specified Education Event on March 20, 2025. The AI checked multiple sources, including video transcripts and news articles, to verify whether the term was used during the event. This shows a high level of adherence to the instructions which demanded evidence from the event itself and not from any other speeches or contexts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It systematically reviews various sources that reported on the event, ensuring that the term \"woke\" was not mentioned by Trump during the specific event. The response also correctly ignores mentions of the term in different contexts or from other dates, which aligns with the prompt's requirement to focus solely on the specified event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms that the event took place as scheduled and scrutinizes the content of Trump's speech during this event. By confirming the absence of the word \"woke\" in any form during the event, the AI aligns its recommendation accurately with the facts verified from reliable sources.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI effectively uses the provided sources to make a well-supported recommendation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with the established facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, thoroughly verifies the facts, and logically concludes based on the evidence from reliable sources.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and demonstrates a meticulous approach to verifying the specific use of the term 'woke' during the event, aligning perfectly with the user prompt's requirements.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905067 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:17:47 UTC",
