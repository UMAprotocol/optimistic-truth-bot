The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Manhattan vs. Incarnate Word CBB game scheduled for March 23 at 12:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Incarnate Word wins, it's p1; Manhattan, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was supposed to happen on March 23, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles confirm the result. Source [1] mentions Incarnate Word defeated Jacksonville in the second round on March 24, but that's a subsequent game. Wait, the initial game was against Manhattan on March 23. Let me check the other sources. \n\nSource [2] is a box score from March 23 showing Incarnate Word (IW) 92 vs. Manhattan 85. The title says Incarnate Word tops Manhattan. Source [7] from ESPN also states the final score as 92-85 in favor of Incarnate Word. Source [8] from CBS Sports has a detailed recap titled \"Dylan Hayman, Jordan Pyke lead Incarnate Word over Manhattan 92-85 in 1st round of CBI Tournament,\" which clearly states Incarnate Word's victory. \n\nAdditionally, source [6] is the official box score from UIW's website, which corroborates the result. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to Incarnate Word winning the March 23 game. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe game between Manhattan and Incarnate Word occurred on March 23, 2025, as scheduled. According to multiple verified sources, **Incarnate Word defeated Manhattan 92-85** in the first round of the CBI Tournament[2][7][8]. Key details include:\n\n- **Final Score**: Incarnate Word 92, Manhattan 85[2][7][8].\n- **Top Performers**: Incarnate Word\u2019s Dylan Hayman scored 25 points, and Jordan Pyke added a double-double (23 points, 11 rebounds)[8].\n- **Outcome**: The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up was required[1][2][8].\n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Incarnate Word\"** (p1).  \nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Manhattan vs. Incarnate Word CBB game) and its scheduled date. It verifies the outcome using multiple sources, which all confirm that Incarnate Word won the game. This is in line with the user prompt's requirement to resolve based on verified facts and the specific event outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the current date against the event date, confirms the event has occurred, and then proceeds to verify the outcome using reliable sources. It correctly identifies that the game was not postponed or canceled, which aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses multiple sources to verify the event's outcome, ensuring the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The sources are appropriately cited, and the details from these sources (final score, top performers) are consistent and relevant to the resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
