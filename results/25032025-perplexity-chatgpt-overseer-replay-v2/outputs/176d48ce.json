        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the East Carolina vs. UAB game. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided sources. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The current date given is March 26, 2025, which is after the event date. So the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the search results. Looking through the sources, multiple reports confirm that UAB won the game. For example, source [3] states that UAB defeated East Carolina 94-77. This is corroborated by sources [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], and [14]. All these sources consistently report the final score as UAB 94, East Carolina 77. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if UAB wins, the market resolves to \"UAB\" (p1). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, and all sources confirm the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution should be p1. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in question is the same as reported. All sources refer to the AAC Tournament quarterfinals on March 14, 2025, at Dickies Arena, which matches the user's query. There's no conflicting information about the event details. \n\nSince the event occurred, the outcome is clear, and the resolution conditions are met, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe American Athletic Conference (AAC) Tournament quarterfinal game between the UAB Blazers and East Carolina Pirates occurred on March 14, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas. **Third-seeded UAB defeated sixth-seeded East Carolina 94-77**[3][4][5][7][8][9][10][14], advancing to the semifinals against North Texas. \n\n**Key details:**\n- UAB's Yaxel Lendeborg delivered a historic performance with **30 points, 20 rebounds, 8 assists, 5 steals, and 4 blocks**[3][4][5][14], setting an AAC Tournament record for rebounds in a game.\n- East Carolina\u2019s RJ Felton scored a team-high 31 points in the loss[3][4][5][10].\n- UAB led 49-33 at halftime and maintained control throughout the second half[3][8][9].\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Based on the resolution conditions provided, **the market resolves to \"UAB\" (p1)**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742985436 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:37:16 UTC"
