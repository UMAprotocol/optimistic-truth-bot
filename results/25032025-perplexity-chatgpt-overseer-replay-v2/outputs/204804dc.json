        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about resolving a market based on a college basketball game between Mt. St. Mary's and Mercer scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Mt. St. Mary's wins, the market resolves to them (p2), if Mercer wins, it's p1, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually happened on that date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the event is in the past. Now, looking through the search results, I need to find any mention of a game between Mt. St. Mary's and Mercer on March 14. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are about games involving Mt. St. Mary's against other teams like Merrimack, Iona, American, etc. For example, result [1] and [2] discuss a game between Mt. St. Mary's and Merrimack on March 14, 2025, where Mt. St. Mary's won 57-55. Results [3] and [7] mention a women's basketball game and a softball game on March 14, but not against Mercer. \n\nResults [13] and [14] are from 2022 and 2018, discussing lacrosse games between Mercer and Mt. St. Mary's, which are irrelevant here. Other results like [5] and [16] mention games against American and other teams but not Mercer. \n\nThere's no mention in any of the provided search results of a basketball game between Mt. St. Mary's and Mercer on March 14, 2025. The only games listed for that date are against Merrimack (men's basketball), Army (softball), and Fairfield (women's basketball). Since there's no evidence of the game occurring or being canceled, and the event date is in the past, the market should resolve based on the absence of verifiable information. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, if the game was canceled with no make-up, it resolves to p3 (50-50). However, the user's ancillary data says if canceled, resolve to p3. Since there's no information about the game being played or postponed, and it's past the date, the correct resolution is p4, which indicates the event hasn't occurred or can't be verified. Wait, wait, the personalization instructions mention that if the event is in the past but no info is available, and not specified as postponed/canceled, assume the most probable outcome. But in this case, there's no info at all about the game existing. The user might have a typo, confusing Merrimack with Mercer. But per the instructions, we must resolve based on the exact event in the prompt. Since the specific game isn't found, and it's past the date, the resolution should be p4 because the event as described didn't occur.\n</think>\n\nThe query pertains to resolving a market based on the outcome of a college basketball game between **Mt. St. Mary's** and **Mercer** scheduled for **March 14, 2025**. However, after analyzing the provided search results, **no evidence of this specific game occurring** exists.  \n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Mt. St. Mary's Schedule**:  \n   - On March 14, 2025, Mt. St. Mary's men's basketball team played **Merrimack** in the MAAC Tournament semifinals, winning 57-55[1][2][15].  \n   - The women's basketball team faced **Fairfield** in the MAAC Semifinals on the same day[7].  \n   - The softball team played **Army** on March 14[3].  \n\n2. **Mercer\u2019s Schedule**:  \n   - No search results mention a March 14, 2025, basketball game between Mercer and Mt. St. Mary's. Historical results reference **lacrosse matchups** from 2018 and 2022[13][14], unrelated to the query.  \n\n3. **Resolution Conditions**:  \n   - The game described in the query (**Mt. St. Mary's vs. Mercer**) does not appear in any verified sources.  \n   - Since the event date is in the past (March 14, 2025) and no outcome or postponement/cancellation is documented, the resolution defaults to **p4** (unresolved due to insufficient verifiable information).  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe absence of verifiable data about the specified game, combined with the lack of evidence for cancellation or postponement, necessitates a **p4 resolution**.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by checking the event's status against the current date and searching for verifiable outcomes. The logical reasoning applied in the response is sound, as it systematically searches for and analyzes relevant information before concluding that there is no evidence of the game occurring or being canceled.\n\nHowever, there are critical procedural errors in the response:\n1. The response concludes with a recommendation of p4 (unresolved due to insufficient verifiable information), which is typically a valid conclusion given the absence of information about the event. However, according to the critical rule provided, if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a retry must always be initiated. This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining verifiable information are exhausted before settling on a p4 resolution.\n\n2. The response could potentially improve by employing more diverse or deeper search strategies, possibly accessing different databases or sources that might have information on lower-profile events like college basketball games.\n\nGiven these points, the decision must follow the critical rule stipulated for first attempts that conclude with a p4 recommendation.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt concluding with a p4 recommendation requires a retry to exhaust all possible information sources.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response was logically sound and adhered to the instructions but did not explore all potential information sources as required for a first attempt p4 conclusion.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please utilize additional sports databases or news archives that might contain detailed records of college basketball games to verify the occurrence or cancellation of the Mt.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a prediction market for a college basketball game between Mt. St. Mary's and Mercer scheduled for March 14, 2025. The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve based on the game's outcome. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. The search results include several articles about Mt. St. Mary's games around that time. Looking at result [1], there's a game mentioned on March 14, 2025, where Mt. St. Mary's played Merrimack, not Mercer. They won 57-55. Then, in [6] and [7], there's mention of them winning the MAAC championship on March 16 and advancing to the NCAA Tournament. \n\nWait, the query mentions Mercer, but the search results don't show a game against Mercer on March 14. Instead, they played Merrimack. That's a key point. The user might have confused Merrimack with Mercer. Let me check other sources. Result [2] is a box score from February 23 against Rider, and [16] shows their schedule with games against Marist, Merrimack, and Iona in March. No mention of Mercer. \n\nSince the game in question was against Merrimack, not Mercer, the market's conditions are based on a matchup that didn't occur. The resolution criteria require the game to be played between Mt. St. Mary's and Mercer. Since the game was canceled or never scheduled (as evidenced by the absence of any mention of Mercer in the relevant dates), the market should resolve to p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data. \n\nAdditionally, result [8] states that if a game is canceled without a reschedule, the market resolves 50-50. Here, since the teams didn't play each other on the specified date, it's effectively a cancellation. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3.\n</think>\n\nThe Mt. St. Mary's vs. Mercer game scheduled for March 14, 2025, did not occur as specified in the query. Instead, Mt. St. Mary's played **Merrimack** on March 14, winning 57-55 in the MAAC Tournament semifinals[1][17]. This confusion between \"Mercer\" and \"Merrimack\" appears to stem from a typographical error or misidentification, as no evidence exists of a March 14 matchup between Mt. St. Mary's and Mercer in the provided sources.\n\n**Key evidence:**\n- Mt. St. Mary's March 14 game was explicitly against Merrimack, with detailed box scores and recaps confirming this opponent[1][17].\n- The team's subsequent March 16 MAAC Championship victory over Iona[7] and March 19 NCAA Tournament First Four game against American[6][9][10] further confirm their schedule contained no Mercer matchup.\n\nSince the specified game (Mt. St. Mary's vs. Mercer) was **never played** and effectively canceled, the market resolves to **p3 (50-50)** per the resolution conditions stating: *\"If the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\"*\n\nrecommendation: p3",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the occurrence of the event through reliable sources. It correctly identifies that the game between Mt. St. Mary's and Mercer did not occur on March 14, 2025, and instead, Mt. St. Mary's played Merrimack. This finding is crucial as it directly impacts the resolution of the market.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically concludes that since the specified game against Mercer did not occur, and no evidence suggests it was rescheduled, the market should resolve to p3 (50-50), as per the ancillary data conditions for a canceled game. This reasoning is sound and well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm that the game against Mercer did not take place and that there was a game against Merrimack instead. This thorough verification ensures that the recommendation aligns accurately with the facts.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: The response does not exhibit any noticeable bias or errors. It critically evaluates the sources and uses them to substantiate its findings. The response does not appear to have omitted any significant information that could influence the outcome.\n\nGiven the thorough investigation and alignment with the user prompt and ancillary data, the response is satisfactory. It has successfully resolved the query based on verified facts and logical reasoning, adhering strictly to the guidelines provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verified the non-occurrence of the specified event and provided a well-supported resolution recommendation aligned with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the event details and adhered to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909194 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:26:34 UTC",
