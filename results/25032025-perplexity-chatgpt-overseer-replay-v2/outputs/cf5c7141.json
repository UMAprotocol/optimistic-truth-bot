        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Villanova vs. UConn game on March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if UConn wins, it's p1; Villanova, p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 13 has already happened. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, sources [4] and [8] both report that UConn won the game 73-56. Specifically, source [4] states, \"UConn uses late run to beat Villanova 73-56 in Big East Conference Tournament quarterfinal,\" and source [8] confirms the same score and outcome. Other sources like [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], and [7] discuss the game previews and predictions, but the actual result is clearly in [4] and [8]. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution isn't p3. Since UConn won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All the necessary information is confirmed by multiple sources, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe UConn Huskies defeated the Villanova Wildcats 73-56 in the Big East Conference Tournament quarterfinal game played on March 13, 2025, at Madison Square Garden. UConn trailed 36-31 at halftime but used a dominant second-half performance, outscoring Villanova 42-20 after the break. Alex Karaban led the Huskies with 18 points (15 in second half) and 9 rebounds, while Villanova's Eric Dixon was held to 8 points on 2-15 shooting[4][8]. \n\nThis outcome triggers the resolution condition where **p1 (UConn)** is the correct market resolution, as defined by the ancillary data specifying UConn victories resolve to p1. The game was completed as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations mentioned in any verified sources.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

It then proceeds to verify the outcome using reliable sources, specifically citing sources [4] and [8] that confirm UConn's victory. The response also correctly ignores any potential for the game being postponed or canceled, as there is no mention of such occurrences in the verified sources.\n\nThe recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the facts verified and the conditions specified in the ancillary data. The response is thorough in detailing the game's score, the performance of key players, and the game's context within the Big East Conference Tournament, which adds to the completeness and reliability of the resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the instructions to report based on verified facts and established outcomes, without predicting or assuming results without evidence.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Villanova vs. UConn game, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions without any errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used verified sources to confirm the game's outcome and provided a detailed account of the game, enhancing the reliability and completeness of the resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931527 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:38:47 UTC",
