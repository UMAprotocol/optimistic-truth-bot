        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 60 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"President\" in the next briefing she participates in before the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any upcoming press briefing scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the search results don't mention any future briefings beyond February 2025. The latest transcripts available are from February 5, 20, and 23, 2025. There's no information about a briefing after March 25, so the next one hasn't happened yet.\n\nNext, I should analyze her past behavior. Looking at the provided transcripts, in the February 5 briefing, she used \"President\" multiple times when referring to Trump. For example, in the transcript from February 5, she mentions \"President Trump\" several times in her statements. Similarly, in the February 20 briefing, she refers to \"President Trump\" frequently. However, counting exact instances from the excerpts provided, it's clear she uses the term often, but whether it reaches 60 times in a single briefing is uncertain.\n\nThe user's query specifies that any form of \"President\" (including plural or possessive) counts, but other forms don't. The resolution also notes that if she ceases to be Press Secretary before the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". The search results indicate she's currently in office as of March 25, 2025, with no mention of her leaving the position. \n\nSince the next briefing hasn't occurred yet and there's no data to confirm the count, the market can't be resolved as \"Yes\" or \"No\" yet. However, the deadline is December 31, 2025. If no briefing happens by then, it resolves to \"No\". But since the user is asking about the next briefing whenever it occurs, and given her track record of frequent use, there's a possibility she might reach 60 mentions. However, without concrete evidence from the next briefing, it's impossible to confirm. \n\nBut wait, the current date is March 25, 2025, and the user's query is about the \"next\" briefing after this date. Since there's no information on any briefings after March 25 in the search results, and the deadline is December 31, 2025, the next briefing could still happen. However, based on the available data, we can't predict the exact count. The resolution conditions state that if the event doesn't occur by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing whenever it happens, not whether it will happen. \n\nGiven that the event (the next briefing) hasn't occurred yet as of the current date, and there's no way to verify the count without the actual transcript or video, the resolution should be p4 (cannot be resolved at this time) because the event is in the future. However, the ancillary data specifies that if the event doesn't happen by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). But the user's question is about the next briefing whenever it occurs. Since the next briefing is a future event relative to March 25, 2025, and the resolution depends on an event that hasn't happened yet, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the resolution conditions in the ancillary data have p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50), but the instructions say to use p4 if the event is in the future. \n\nWait, the personalization section says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". Since the next briefing is a future event, even if it's scheduled for the same day but later, it's still p4. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4 because the event hasn't occurred yet, and we can't verify until it happens.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question, Karoline Leavitt's next White House press briefing, is a future event as of the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that it cannot predict future outcomes and must base its resolution on events that have already occurred. The recommendation of p4 (cannot be resolved at this time) is appropriate given that the event is scheduled for a future date.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved in several ways:\n\n1. Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions: The response correctly follows the instruction to return p4 for future events. However, it spends considerable time analyzing past events and speculating on possible outcomes, which is unnecessary given the prompt's directive to focus only on verifiable past events.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness: The response provides a thorough analysis of past briefings to gauge the frequency of the term \"President\" being used. However, this analysis is irrelevant for resolving the query since the event has not occurred yet. The response should focus more succinctly on verifying the scheduling of the event and confirming its future status.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts: The response verifies that no briefing is scheduled beyond the current date and correctly aligns the recommendation with this fact. However, it could streamline the verification process by focusing solely on the scheduling of the event rather than analyzing past briefing content.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors: The response does not contain factual errors or biases, but it includes unnecessary speculation about past events and potential future occurrences, which could be streamlined.\n\nGiven the critical rule that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always result in a retry, and considering the areas for improvement noted above, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response correctly identifies the event as a future one requiring a p4 outcome, but it includes unnecessary analysis of past events. A retry could focus more directly on verifying the event's scheduling and status.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should eliminate unnecessary speculation and analysis of past events, focusing instead on confirming the future status of the event more succinctly.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please confirm the scheduling of Karoline Leavitt's next White House press briefing and provide a recommendation based solely on this verification.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 60 or more times in her next White House press briefing. The resolution depends on the specific conditions outlined in the ancillary data. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the date of the next press briefing. The current date is March 25, 2025. The latest search result mentioning a briefing is from March 17, 2025 (source 11), and another on March 5 (source 4). There's also a mention of a Cabinet meeting on February 26 (source 12), but no specific briefing after March 17. \n\nThe user's query is about the next briefing after March 25. Since there's no information in the search results about any scheduled briefings after March 25, I can't confirm that a briefing will occur before the deadline of December 31, 2025. The ancillary data states that if no briefing happens by then, the market resolves to \"No\" (p1). \n\nAdditionally, the search results don't indicate any upcoming briefings. The latest available data is from March 17, and there's no mention of future events. Without evidence of a scheduled briefing, the resolution defaults to p4, but according to the conditions, it should be p1 if no briefing occurs. However, the user's personalization rules require checking if the event is in the future. Since the current date is March 25 and the next briefing isn't scheduled, it's a future event. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4 because the event hasn't happened yet and there's no confirmation it will occur.\n\nWait, the ancillary data says if no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). But since the event is in the future and we can't confirm it will happen, per the user's instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, we return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions already account for the possibility of no briefing by resolving to p1. But the user's personalization rules state that if the event is in the future, regardless of the market's conditions, we should return p4. \n\nThis is a bit conflicting. The market's own rules say resolve to p1 if no briefing occurs, but the user's instructions override that by saying if the event is in the future (even if it's the same day but later time), return p4. Since the next briefing isn't scheduled yet and there's no information, it's a future event. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 60+ times during her next White House press briefing. Based on the resolution conditions and available evidence:\n\n1. **No Confirmed Future Briefing**: The most recent confirmed briefing occurred on March 17, 2025[11], with no search results indicating a scheduled future briefing after March 25, 2025 (the current date). The ancillary data specifies resolution to \"No\" only if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025. However, since the event (next briefing) is inherently future-dated and unconfirmed, it cannot be verified at this time.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: In her March 17 briefing, Leavitt used variations of \"President\" 18 times[11], far below the 60+ threshold. Earlier briefings (e.g., February 5 and February 12) showed similar patterns[14][15], with no instance approaching 60 uses.\n\n3. **Lack of Definitive Evidence**: Without confirmation of a future briefing date or evidence that Leavitt\u2019s speaking patterns will drastically change, the query hinges on a hypothetical event that has not yet occurred and cannot be verified.\n\nrecommendation: p4",

It adheres to the instruction that if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4. This is accurate as per the system's rules.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows the guidelines by checking for the scheduling of the next press briefing and finding no scheduled briefing after March 25, 2025. It correctly concludes that without a confirmed date, the event is considered a future event, leading to a p4 recommendation. However, the response could improve by more explicitly stating that no reliable sources confirm the scheduling beyond the last known briefing on March 17, 2025.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that there is no scheduled briefing after the current date and aligns this with the recommendation of p4, which is correct. However, it could strengthen its verification by possibly checking more sources or official White House schedules to confirm the absence of scheduled briefings.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not appear biased but does miss an opportunity to provide a more robust search for additional sources that might confirm the scheduling of future briefings. It also does not mention checking official White House communications, which could be a critical oversight.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still defaults to p4 without exploring potential additional sources more thoroughly, a retry could be warranted to ensure all possible sources are exhausted. This is especially important given the critical nature of the information and the need for absolute certainty in oracle responses.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response needs to explore additional sources or official schedules to confirm the absence of any future briefings more definitively.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response correctly follows the logic required for a p4 recommendation based on the information available but could benefit from a more thorough search of potential sources, including official White House communications, to ensure no future briefing is scheduled.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please check official White House communications and any other authoritative sources that might list the schedule of future press briefings to confirm whether or not a briefing is scheduled after March 25, 2025.\"\n}\n```",

        "attempt": 3,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"President\" 60 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 if it's uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the market resolves to No if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer Press Secretary by then.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing after March 25, 2025. The search results include several briefings from January to March 2025. The latest one mentioned is on March 17, 2025 (source 16), and another on March 20, 2025 (source 5). However, there's no information about any briefings scheduled after March 25. The user is asking about the \"next\" briefing, which would be after March 25. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the latest mentioned briefing is March 20, there's no data on future briefings.\n\nNext, I need to verify if Leavitt is still the Press Secretary. The search results confirm she assumed office on January 20, 2025 (source 2, 6, 9, 10, 15), and there's no indication she has left the position. So, she's still in office as of the current date.\n\nNow, looking at past briefings to estimate the likelihood. For example, in the February 25 briefing (source 17), the transcript shows her using \"President\" multiple times, but I need to count. Let's see: in the opening statement, she says \"President Trump\" several times. In the provided excerpts, \"President\" is used at least 10 times in the first few paragraphs. If this pattern continues, it's possible she could reach 60 mentions in a full briefing. However, without a full transcript, it's hard to be exact. \n\nAnother example is the January 31 briefing (source 19), where \"President\" is frequently used. But again, without full transcripts, it's challenging to get an accurate count. The March 17 briefing (source 16) also shows frequent use of \"President Trump.\"\n\nHowever, the key point is that the next briefing hasn't occurred yet, and there's no official schedule for it. The user's query is about a future event. Since there's no confirmed briefing after March 25, and the resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to No. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking about the \"next\" briefing. If a briefing is scheduled after March 25 but before December 31, the market is still active. However, based on the provided search results, there's no information about any upcoming briefings. The White House's official website (source 1, 18) doesn't list future briefings beyond March. Without official announcements, we can't confirm a future briefing. \n\nTherefore, since the next briefing isn't scheduled yet, and there's no evidence it will occur before the deadline, the market should resolve to p4 (cannot be determined now). But wait, the resolution conditions say if no briefing happens by December 31, it resolves to No (p1). However, the user is asking for a recommendation based on current information. Since we don't know if a briefing will happen, but the deadline is December 31, the safe bet is p4 because the event is in the future and not confirmed. However, the user's additional guidance says to check official sources. The search results don't show any official White House communications about future briefings after March 25. Therefore, as of now, there's no scheduled briefing, so the answer would default to p4, but according to the resolution conditions, if no briefing happens, it's p1. But since the event is in the future and hasn't occurred yet, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's personalization rules state that if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. Since there's no scheduled date, it's a future event, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response correctly identifies that the event in question (Karoline Leavitt saying \"President\" 60+ times in a briefing) is scheduled for a future date, which is crucial for determining the appropriate recommendation.\n2. It adheres to the instruction to check for the scheduling of the next White House press briefing and confirms Karoline Leavitt's current role as the Press Secretary.\n3. The response logically concludes that since no future briefing is scheduled as of the current date, and the event is set for a future date, the recommendation should be p4 (cannot be determined now).\n\n**Areas Needing Improvement:**\n1. **Verification of Future Events:** The response could improve by providing more direct evidence or sources confirming the absence of scheduled briefings post-March 25, 2025. It mentions checking sources but does not detail this process sufficiently.\n2. **Use of Past Data:** While the response correctly avoids predicting future outcomes based on past data, it delves unnecessarily into past briefing analysis, which is irrelevant given the future nature of the event.\n3. **Clarity and Focus:** The response includes some redundant explanations about past briefings and the usage of the term \"President.\" These do not contribute to resolving the current query and could be streamlined to focus solely on the event's scheduling and Karoline Leavitt's current role.\n4. **Source Reliability and Critical Evaluation:** The response mentions multiple sources but does not critically evaluate their reliability or relevance in confirming the scheduling of future briefings. More rigorous scrutiny of the sources and possibly seeking additional, authoritative sources would strengthen the response.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response still shows areas for improvement, particularly in verifying the absence of scheduled future events more robustly and streamlining the content to focus on relevant facts, a retry is warranted.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response needs to more robustly verify the absence of scheduled future briefings and improve clarity by focusing solely on relevant facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should enhance the verification of no scheduled briefings post-March 25, 2025, through more direct evidence and authoritative sources. It should also eliminate unnecessary analysis of past events and streamline the content to focus on the scheduling and current role of Karoline Leavitt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please provide direct evidence or authoritative sources confirming the absence of scheduled White House press briefings post-March 25, 2025.
