The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Queens vs. Northern Arizona basketball game scheduled for March 23, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Queens wins, it's p2; if Northern Arizona wins, p1; and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game should have already happened. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [1] mentions the game on March 23 with Queens winning 85-78. Source [2] also reports the same score and outcome. \n\nNext, I need to verify the exact teams and the result. The ancillary data links p2 to Queens winning. The search results consistently state Queens University of Charlotte defeated Northern Arizona 85-78. Sources [1], [2], [4], [5], and [6] all confirm this result. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here.\n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. All sources align on the outcome, so there's no discrepancy. The resolution conditions are clear: Queens' victory means p2. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Queens University of Charlotte men's basketball team defeated Northern Arizona 85-78 in the first round of the 2025 Purple College Basketball Invitational on March 23, 2025. This outcome was verified through multiple authoritative sources including official university athletics reports[1], Associated Press coverage[2], and tournament organizers[6]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation.\n\n**Key Details:**\n- Final score: Queens 85, Northern Arizona 78[1][2][6]\n- Queens achieved their first 20-win season in Division 1 program history[1][4]\n- The game featured nine Queens players scoring, led by Chris Ashby's 22-point performance including six three-pointers (a new school record)[1][2][4]\n\n**Resolution Analysis:**\n- The market resolves to \"Queens\" (p2) under the defined conditions since they won the game\n- No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in any verified sources\n- All game reports confirm the March 23 completion date aligns with the market's event timeframe\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response is thorough in checking for any discrepancies or indications of postponement or cancellation, which there were none.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event against the user prompt's conditions and correctly aligns the recommendation (p2) with the verified outcome of the game. The use of authoritative sources such as official university athletics reports and Associated Press coverage ensures the accuracy of the event verification.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923656 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:27:36 UTC"
