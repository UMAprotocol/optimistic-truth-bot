The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using that specific word during the event. The key sources here are the ones detailing the March 17 meeting. Let's look through the provided search results.\n\nLooking at result [3], it mentions Trump's visit on March 17 where he criticized the building and discussed changes. However, there's no direct quote of him saying \"Propaganda\" during that event. Result [10] and [12] also discuss his visit, focusing on his comments about \"Hamilton\" and the center's disrepair, but again, no mention of the word \"Propaganda\" in those contexts. \n\nResult [7] notes Trump attended the board meeting as the new chair but doesn't mention the specific term. Result [13] and [14] detail the board meeting and his criticisms but again, no use of \"Propaganda\" during the event. \n\nEarlier sources from February ([1], [2], [5], [6]) mention Trump's prior statements about removing \"anti-American propaganda\" and \"drag shows\" from the Kennedy Center, but those were made before March 17, either on Truth Social or in press releases. The March 17 event itself, according to the available reports, doesn't include him using the word \"Propaganda\" during his remarks or Q&A. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that any usage during the appearance, including Q&A, counts. However, none of the sources covering the March 17 event report him using the term. Therefore, based on the provided information, Trump did not say \"Propaganda\" during the specified event.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did not use the word \"Propaganda\" during his March 17, 2025, Kennedy Center board meeting appearance. While Trump had previously vowed to eliminate \"anti-American propaganda\" at the Kennedy Center in February 2025 announcements[1][5][6], no sources indicate he used the term during the March 17 event itself. Coverage of the meeting focused on his criticism of the building's condition, Broadway programming changes, and union costs[3][10][12], but none documented the specific word's usage during remarks or Q&A sessions. Since the resolution depends on verified usage during the March 17 appearance, and no evidence supports this occurrence, the market resolves accordingly.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions by focusing on whether Donald Trump used the word \"Propaganda\" during his appearance at the Kennedy Center on March 17, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on Trump's usage of the term during this specific event and not on any prior or unrelated mentions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by systematically reviewing various sources that reported on the event. It correctly concludes that none of these sources documented Trump using the word \"Propaganda\" during his remarks or the Q&A session. This thorough search and clear reasoning ensure that the response is complete and considers all relevant information available up to the date of the event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and examines the content of Trump's speech and interactions during the event. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) aligns perfectly with the facts presented and analyzed, adhering strictly to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant pieces of missing information in the response. The AI has focused solely on verified facts and reliable sources, as required by the system prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" is well-supported by the evidence presented.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, provides a logical and complete analysis, and aligns the recommendation with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided sources to confirm that the term 'Propaganda' was not used by Donald Trump during the specified event, leading to a correct market resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
