        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"France\" during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term was used in that specific meeting. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the ones related to the March 13 meeting. Let's look at sources 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17. \n\nSource 11 mentions the meeting between Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, discussing Ukraine and defense spending. Source 12 also covers this meeting, noting Trump's praise for Rutte and discussions on defense budgets. Source 14 is interesting because it mentions Trump talking about Greenland and Canada, but not France. Source 15 includes remarks from Trump and Rutte before their meeting. Trump talks about NATO's strength and mentions Greenland again, but there's no reference to France. Source 16 is a NATO multimedia link, but the transcript isn't provided here. Source 17 is a YouTube video summary, which mentions discussions about Ukraine and Greenland, but again, no mention of France.\n\nLooking at other sources, like 10, which is from March 7, Macron mentions France's role in NATO, but that's a different event. The other sources from 2019 and 2024 discuss past interactions between Trump and Macron but aren't relevant to the March 13, 2025 meeting.\n\nNone of the sources directly indicate that Trump said \"France\" during the specific meeting with the NATO Secretary General. The focus was on Ukraine, defense spending, and other territorial issues like Greenland. Since the resolution conditions state that only the scheduled meeting counts, and there's no evidence of \"France\" being mentioned there, the answer should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nThe scheduled meeting between Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on March 13, 2025, focused primarily on defense spending commitments, Ukraine-Russia ceasefire negotiations, and unrelated territorial claims about Greenland and Canada[11][12][14][15][17]. While Trump discussed NATO's financial burden-sharing and praised Rutte's leadership, none of the available transcripts, press summaries, or video analyses of this specific Oval Office meeting indicate that Trump uttered the word \"France\" during the event[11][12][14][15][17]. \n\nThe discussion centered on:\n- Ukraine conflict resolution efforts[11][12]\n- NATO members' defense spending targets[12][15]\n- U.S. interest in Greenland's strategic position[14][17]\n- Criticisms of previous administrations' policies[15]\n\nThough France's nuclear deterrent strategy and tensions with Russia were mentioned in separate contexts days earlier[10], these discussions occurred outside the scope of the March 13 bilateral meeting with Rutte. The resolution criteria explicitly exclude preceding speeches and limit evaluation to the designated meeting timeframe and content[11][12][14].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event in question is the meeting between Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on March 13, 2025. It correctly focuses on whether the term \"France\" was mentioned during this specific meeting, adhering to the user prompt's requirement to only consider the designated meeting for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by examining relevant sources that discuss the content of the meeting. It correctly concludes that the term \"France\" was not mentioned, based on the absence of this term in the descriptions of the meeting's discussions. The response also appropriately excludes references to other events or contexts where \"France\" might have been mentioned, sticking strictly to the meeting specified in the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event through multiple sources and aligns its recommendation with the facts presented. The recommendation of \"p1\" (No) is based on the concrete evidence that \"France\" was not mentioned during the meeting.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or significant missing information in the response. The response effectively uses the sources to confirm the details of the meeting and the discussions that took place, focusing solely on the event specified in the prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with the established facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the event, adheres to the prompt instructions, logically analyzes the sources, and aligns the recommendation with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the available sources to confirm the absence of the term 'France' in the specified meeting, adhering closely to the resolution conditions outlined in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
