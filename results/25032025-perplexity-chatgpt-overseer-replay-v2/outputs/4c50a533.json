The ancillary data specifies that if the Rockets win, it's p1; Bulls win is p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past relative to the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 15, so it's already happened. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the Rockets won. ESPN's recap [1] states the Rockets won 117-114. SI.com's article [2] also mentions the Rockets' victory with a score of 117-114. The Fox Sports box score [4] lists the final score as Rockets 117, Bulls 114. YouTube highlights [3][5][6][7][8] all reference the Rockets' win, with specific mentions of key players like Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun contributing to the victory. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game being completed as scheduled with the Rockets as the winners. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Rockets). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The scores across different sources are consistent, and the game details align. No sources indicate any issues with the game's completion. Thus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Houston Rockets defeated the Chicago Bulls 117-114 in their March 15, 2025 matchup at Toyota Center[1][2][4]. Key factors in the Rockets' sixth consecutive win included:\n\n- **Jalen Green's clutch performance**: Scored 28 points with a decisive fourth-quarter three-pointer to take the lead for good at 100-98[1][4]\n- **Alperen Sengun's double-double**: 24 points and 15 rebounds[1][4]\n- **Fred VanVleet's scoring burst**: 23 points including 18 in the second quarter[1][2]\n\nThe game concluded without postponement or cancellation[1][4], meeting all specified resolution conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
