The ancillary data specifies that if Alabama State wins, the market resolves to p1; if St. Francis wins, p2; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, so it's already in the past. That means I need to determine the outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources report the game's result. Source [1] mentions Saint Francis lost 70-68 to Alabama State. Source [4] and [11] confirm Alabama State's victory with a last-second layup by Amarr Knox. Source [18] also details the final score and the game-winning play. \n\nSince the game occurred on March 18 and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation, the next step is to verify the winner. All relevant sources agree that Alabama State won 70-68. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all sources align on Alabama State's win. No sources suggest the game was postponed or canceled. Thus, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA First Four game between St. Francis (PA) and Alabama State occurred on March 18, 2025, as scheduled. Alabama State secured a 70-68 victory with Amarr Knox's buzzer-beating layup with one second remaining[1][4][11][18]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was definitively determined within regulation time. \n\n**Resolution recommendation: p1**",

The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event through multiple sources, which all agree on Alabama State's victory. This verification process aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks for the possibility of postponement or cancellation before confirming the outcome. This ensures that all potential conditions for different resolutions (p1, p2, p3) are considered before arriving at the final recommendation. The response also adheres strictly to the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes.\n\nThere is no missing information, bias, or errors detected in the response. The AI has used the correct sources to verify the event's outcome and has not deviated from the event specifics outlined in the user prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 (Alabama State win) is directly aligned with the facts verified through reliable sources.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome based on reliable sources and adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified information to resolve the query and adheres to all specified instructions without any detected errors or biases.\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742922987 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:16:27 UTC"
