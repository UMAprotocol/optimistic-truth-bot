        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of a college basketball game between North Carolina Central and SC State. The game was scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if SC State wins, the market resolves to p1, and if North Carolina Central wins, it's p2. If canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event should have already happened. Now, I need to look through the search results to find out the actual outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, result [1] is from NC Central's athletics site and mentions they lost the semifinal game to SC State 88-67 on March 14. Result [5] from ABC News confirms the same score, with Omar Croskey scoring 30 points for SC State. Result [7] from CBS Sports also reports SC State's victory with the same score. Additionally, result [4] from SC State's athletics site talks about their upcoming semifinal game against NC Central, and result [5] and [7] both detail the game's outcome, solidifying that SC State won.\n\nAll sources that report on the game's result agree that SC State won 88-67. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since SC State won, the market should resolve to p1. I need to make sure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align here. No other outcomes like postponement or cancellation are indicated. So the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe MEAC semifinal game between North Carolina Central (NCCU) and South Carolina State (SC State) occurred as scheduled on March 14, 2025. SC State secured an 88-67 victory, advancing to the conference championship game[1][5][7]. The Bulldogs established a commanding 54-25 halftime lead behind Omar Croskey's 30-point performance and maintained control despite NCCU's improved second-half effort[1][5][7]. No indications of postponement or cancellation exist in the verified reports.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the outcome of the basketball game between North Carolina Central and SC State, which took place on March 14, 2025. The AI correctly states that SC State won the game with a score of 88-67. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a win by SC State corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event has occurred. It then verifies the outcome through multiple reliable sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and confirming that there was no postponement or cancellation of the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple sources, which all agree on the result of the game. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not omit any crucial information that would affect the resolution of the query. It appropriately focuses on the specific event mentioned in the user prompt and does not stray into unrelated details.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed with the recommendation of p1 is justified based on the verified facts and the alignment with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the event, verifies it with multiple sources, and aligns the recommendation with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and adheres closely to the instructions, providing a well-reasoned and factually supported recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931996 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:46:36 UTC"
