The ancillary data specifies that if George Mason wins, it's p1; Samford wins, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 19, so the event date is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [1] from Samford's athletics site states they lost 86-69. Source [5] from ESPN also reports George Mason's victory with the same score. Other sources like [2], [4], [6], [7], [8], [11], [13], and [14] all corroborate the 86-69 win for George Mason. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the results. All sources discuss the game as having occurred on March 19. Therefore, the game was completed, and George Mason won. \n\nSince the event occurred and George Mason is the winner, the resolution should be p1. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align. No sources suggest a different outcome or any issues with the game's completion. \n\nThus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe game between Samford and George Mason took place on March 19, 2025, as scheduled. **George Mason defeated Samford 86-69** in the NIT first-round matchup[1][5][13]. Multiple sources confirm the final score and outcome, with George Mason leading throughout the game and securing a decisive victory[2][4][6][11]. There is no indication of postponement or cancellation in any of the provided materials. \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **George Mason** (p1) based on their verified win. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928933 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:55:33 UTC"
