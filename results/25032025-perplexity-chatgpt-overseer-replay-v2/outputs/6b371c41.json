The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 12, so the event has already occurred. Now, I need to confirm the result from the search results.\n\nLooking at the sources, [1] is an ESPN recap titled \"Raptors 118-105 76ers (Mar 12, 2025) Game Recap\" which clearly states the Raptors won 118-105. Source [2] from Fox Sports also lists the final score as Raptors 118, 76ers 105. Source [4] from thescore.com confirms the same final score. Other sources like [3], [5], [6], [7] discuss pre-game predictions and player absences but don't contradict the result. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All post-game reports indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the Raptors won, so the resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors on March 12, 2025, concluded with the **Toronto Raptors defeating the Philadelphia 76ers 118-105**[1][2][4]. Key performances included AJ Lawson (28 points) and Jared Rhoden (25 points, 12 rebounds) for the Raptors, while Quentin Grimes led the 76ers with 29 points[1][4]. The game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the available sources[1][2][4][5][6]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1** (Raptors win).\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the NBA game between the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors took place on March 12, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. The outcome of the game is correctly reported with the Toronto Raptors defeating the Philadelphia 76ers 118-105. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Raptors win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event has occurred. It then verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which consistently report the same result. The response also correctly ignores irrelevant pre-game predictions and focuses on the actual game result.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple reliable sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and accurate. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Raptors win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924013 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:33:33 UTC"
