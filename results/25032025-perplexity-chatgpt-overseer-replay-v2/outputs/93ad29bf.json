        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Trevvy knocked out Oblivion in their fight at Adin Ross' Brand Risk 005 event on March 15, 2025. The ancillary data says \"Yes\" is p2 if Trevvy wins by KO or TKO. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to see the outcome of the fight. Looking at the sources, several YouTube videos mention the fight. Search result [1] describes the fight where Oblivion wins by first-round TKO. The transcript mentions \"Oblivion was an under dog\" and \"winner of this fight be our first round TKO\". Similarly, [3] and [5] also describe the fight with Oblivion winning by TKO. \n\nThe user's query is about whether Trevvy KO'd Oblivion, but all sources indicate that Oblivion won, not Trevvy. The official event details in [2] list the fight as \"Oblivion vs Trevvy\" but don't specify the outcome. However, the video transcripts clearly show Oblivion as the winner. \n\nSince the resolution conditions require Trevvy to win by KO/TKO for \"Yes\" (p2), but the fight result is Oblivion winning by TKO, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). The event date is March 15, 2025, which is before the current date of March 25, 2025, so no cancellation issues. Therefore, the market resolves to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nThe boxing match between Trevvy (@9trevv) and Oblivion (@oblivion_sw) at Adin Ross' **Brand Risk 005** event on March 15, 2025, concluded with **Oblivion winning by first-round TKO** [1][3][5]. Multiple eyewitness accounts from the event's livestream and post-fight analyses confirm that Oblivion dominated the fight, leading to an early stoppage by the referee. Trevvy was unable to continue defending himself effectively after being stunned by Oblivion's strikes, prompting the TKO decision[1][5].\n\n### Key Details:\n- **Outcome**: Oblivion secured a technical knockout (TKO) in the first round, making Trevvy the loser of the bout[1][3][5].\n- **Market Resolution**: Since the market specifies a \"Yes\" resolution only if Trevvy wins by KO/TKO, and the fight result was a TKO victory for Oblivion, the resolution is **\"No\"** (p1)[1][2][5].\n- **Event Status**: The fight occurred as scheduled on March 15, 2025, with no postponement or cancellation[2][6].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

This is in line with the user prompt's requirement for factual reporting based on the event's outcome. The response correctly uses the provided URL and other credible sources to verify the outcome of the fight.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the conditions set forth in the user prompt, specifically that the market would resolve to \"Yes\" only if Trevvy won by KO or TKO. Since Oblivion was the winner by TKO, the logical conclusion is that the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). The response is complete in covering the necessary details to reach this conclusion, including the verification of the fight's occurrence and outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and confirms the outcome through multiple sources, including video transcripts and official event details. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) aligns perfectly with the facts as Trevvy did not win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and uses the specified sources to derive its conclusion.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory.
