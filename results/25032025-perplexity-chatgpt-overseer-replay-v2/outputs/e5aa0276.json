The ancillary data specifies that if the Wild win, it's p1; Sabres win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 22) is in the past. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the result from the search results.\n\nLooking through the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [5], [6], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]) report that the Minnesota Wild beat the Buffalo Sabres 4-1 on March 22. For example, source [1] states, \"Wild beat the Buffalo Sabres 4-1 on Saturday.\" Similarly, source [3] and others confirm the same score and outcome. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. The Sabres' loss is noted in several recaps, and the Wild's victory is consistently reported. \n\nSince the Wild won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information in the sources, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Buffalo Sabres and Minnesota Wild on March 22, 2025, concluded with a **4-1 victory for the Minnesota Wild**[1][3][5][6][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. The Wild secured the win with a decisive three-goal second period, highlighted by goals from Marco Rossi, Justin Brazeau, and Mats Zuccarello, followed by an empty-net goal from Frederick Gaudreau[1][6][13]. Buffalo\u2019s lone goal came from JJ Peterka in the third period[1][10]. The game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the search results.  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **p1** (Wild) based on their confirmed victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between the Sabres and the Wild on March 22, 2025) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all confirm that the Minnesota Wild won against the Buffalo Sabres with a score of 4-1. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Wild win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which are absent, thus confirming the game was played as scheduled. The response then correctly applies the resolution condition (p1 for a Wild win) based on the verified outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the reliability of the information. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is directly aligned with the verified facts and the conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the user prompt and system instructions, using only verified facts to make its recommendation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation is based on concrete evidence and established facts, and there is a clear alignment between the resolution conditions and the verified outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources, correctly applies the resolution conditions, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome and makes a logical recommendation based on the user prompt's resolution conditions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908611 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:16:51 UTC"
