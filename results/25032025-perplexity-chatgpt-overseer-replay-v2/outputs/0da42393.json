The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Utah vs. Seattle Kraken NHL game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, the market resolves to \"Utah\" (p2), if Seattle wins, it's \"Kraken\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the actual result of the game. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Looking through the search results, multiple sources report the outcome. \n\nSearch result [1] from Deseret News mentions Utah lost 4-2 to Seattle. Similarly, [4] from NHL.com and [6] from CBS Sports both state Seattle won 4-2. The ESPN recap in [9] and [13] also confirm the final score as 4-2 in favor of Seattle. Additionally, [11] from NHL.com and [8] from Fox Sports both detail the Kraken's victory with the same score. \n\nAll these sources are consistent: Seattle Kraken won the game 4-2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event occurred and Seattle won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources align. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Utah Hockey Club and Seattle Kraken on March 14, 2025, concluded with a **4-2 victory for the Seattle Kraken**[1][4][6][9][11]. Multiple sources confirm the Kraken secured the win with goals from Eeli Tolvanen (two goals, including an empty-netter), Brandon Montour, and Kaapo Kakko[4][6][9]. Utah's goals came from Nick Schmaltz and Kevin Stenlund, but they couldn't overcome Seattle's third-period surge[9][11]. \n\nThe game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][4][6][9][11]. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **\"Kraken\"** (p1) as the decisive outcome aligns with Seattle's verified win. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933704 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:15:04 UTC"
