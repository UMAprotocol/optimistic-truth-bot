The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Indiana Pacers vs. Philadelphia 76ers game scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Pacers win, the market resolves to \"Pacers\" (p2), if the 76ers win, it's \"76ers\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the actual date of the game. The query mentions March 14, 2025, and the current date provided is March 25, 2025. Since the current date is after the game's scheduled date, the event has already occurred. \n\nNext, I check the search results to find out the game's outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [1] is a YouTube video titled \"PACERS at 76ERS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | March 14, 2025\" which states the Pacers defeated the 76ers 112-100. The date here matches the game date.\n- Source [2] from ESPN's recap also confirms the Pacers won 112-100, with Pascal Siakam scoring 27 points.\n- Source [4] from CBS News Philadelphia reiterates the same score and outcome.\n- Source [7] and [8] also list the Pacers as the winners with the same score.\n\nAll these sources consistently report that the Pacers won the game on March 14, 2025. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The 76ers were missing key players like Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey, but that doesn't affect the outcome's validity. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and the Pacers won, the market should resolve to \"Pacers\" according to the ancillary data, which corresponds to p2. There's no conflicting information in the sources, so the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Indiana Pacers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 112-100 in their NBA game on March 14, 2025[1][2][4][7][8]. The game occurred as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations reported. According to the resolution conditions, since the Pacers won, the market resolves to \"Pacers.\"\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Indiana Pacers vs. Philadelphia 76ers game) occurred on March 14, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the event date. The response uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the game, all of which consistently report that the Pacers won. This aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by confirming the date of the event, verifying the outcome through multiple sources, and then applying the ancillary data to resolve the market. The reasoning is clear, and the response is thorough in checking for any possible postponements or cancellations, which there were none.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using credible sources such as ESPN and CBS News. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Pacers\" (p2) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and meets the requirements set by the system prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
