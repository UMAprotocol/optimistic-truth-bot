The ancillary data specifies that if the Penguins win, it's p1; Devils win, p2; postponed or canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened. Checking the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 12) report the Penguins won 7-3. For example, source [1] states Erik Karlsson scored a power-play goal leading Pittsburgh to victory. The ESPN recap [8] and CBS Sports [12] also confirm the score. \n\nNext, ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed stats and player performances. The Devils' loss ended their three-game streak, and the Penguins extended their winning streak to four. \n\nSince the Penguins won definitively, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information or uncertainties in the sources. All evidence points to a clear Penguins victory.\n</think>\n\nThe New Jersey Devils and Pittsburgh Penguins played their NHL game as scheduled on March 15, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. The Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the New Jersey Devils with a final score of 7-3[1][2][8][11][12]. Multiple sources confirm this outcome, including detailed game recaps from CBS Sports, NHL.com, and ESPN showing Pittsburgh's four consecutive goals in the third period to secure the win[1][9][11].\n\nKey highlights:\n- Pittsburgh's Connor Dewar scored twice, including an empty-net goal[2][9]\n- The Penguins overcame two third-period power-play goals from New Jersey to maintain their lead[4]\n- Tristan Jarry made 24 saves for Pittsburgh, while Jacob Markstrom stopped 16 shots for New Jersey[1][11]\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to \"Penguins\" (p1) as Pittsburgh won the match.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
