        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"Biden\" during his meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are [1], [5], and [8], which all report on the meeting between Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on March 13, 2025. \n\nLooking at [1], the transcript of their remarks before the bilateral meeting, Trump mentions Biden in a critical context. He refers to Biden as \"grossly incompetent\" and talks about documents signed by autopen, implying it was during Biden's administration. The exact quote is: \u201cI don\u2019t see this having \u2014 this was a fluke. This was something that if we had a competent president, it would not have happened. The man was grossly incompetent. All you have to do is look in \u2014 take a look at \u2014 he signs by autopen. Who was signing all this stuff by autopen? Who would think you signed important documents by autopen? You know, these are major documents you\u2019re signing. You\u2019re proud to sign them. You have your signature on something \u2014 in 300 years, they say, \u201cOh, look.\u201d Can you imagine? Everything was signed by autopen \u2014 almost everything. Nobody has ever heard of such a thing.\u201d Here, \"he\" clearly refers to Biden, as Trump is contrasting his own actions with those of the previous administration.\n\nSources [5] and [8] are duplicates, both reporting the same event. They mention Trump's criticisms of NATO spending and his \"America first\" approach but don't directly quote him saying \"Biden.\" However, the primary source [1] is the transcript of the meeting, which includes the direct mention.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that any usage of the term \"Biden\" counts, regardless of context. Even though Trump didn't use the exact name \"Biden\" but referred to him as \"the man\" and \"a competent president,\" the context makes it clear he's talking about Biden. However, the ancillary data specifies that the term must be \"Biden\" exactly, including possessive or plural forms. Since Trump didn't utter the exact word \"Biden\" but used pronouns, this might not meet the criteria. Wait, the user's query says \"Any usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market. Pluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\" So, only if he said \"Biden,\" \"Bidens,\" or \"Biden's\" would it count. Pronouns like \"he\" or \"the man\" don't qualify. \n\nLooking back at the transcript in [1], Trump says \"if we had a competent president,\" referring to Biden, but doesn't use the name. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since he didn't explicitly say \"Biden,\" the answer should be \"No.\" \n\nBut wait, the user's query might have a mistake. Let me double-check the transcript. In [1], the exact words are: \u201cI don\u2019t see this having \u2014 this was a fluke. This was something that if we had a competent president, it would not have happened. The man was grossly incompetent.\" The term \"Biden\" isn't used here. Therefore, despite the reference, the exact term wasn't spoken. \n\nThus, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). But I need to confirm all sources. Are there any other mentions? Sources [3], [7], [10] discuss Biden's comments about Trump and NATO but don't relate to Trump's March 13 meeting. Sources [5] and [8] don't mention Trump saying \"Biden\" during that meeting. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, Trump did not explicitly say \"Biden\" during the meeting with the NATO Secretary General on March 13, 2025. The resolution should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nBased on the official transcript of the March 13, 2025 Oval Office meeting between President Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte[1][5][8], Donald Trump did **not** explicitly utter the word \"Biden\" during the bilateral meeting. While Trump criticized his predecessor's administration through phrases like \"if we had a competent president\" and references to autopen document signings[1], he avoided directly naming Joe Biden in his remarks.\n\nThe resolution criteria specify that only explicit uses of the term \"Biden\" (including possessives/plurals) would qualify. Contextual references to Biden through pronouns like \"he\" or descriptors like \"the man\" do not meet the contractual requirements for resolution[1][5][8]. No instances of the exact term \"Biden\" appear in the verified transcript of this specific meeting.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of event, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions and conditions for resolution. It correctly identifies that the term \"Biden\" must be used explicitly for the market to resolve to \"Yes.\" The response also correctly notes that pronouns or indirect references do not meet the resolution criteria.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by analyzing the transcript and other sources to confirm whether Trump explicitly mentioned \"Biden.\" It correctly concludes that since Trump did not use the term \"Biden\" explicitly, the market should resolve to \"No.\" The reasoning is thorough and considers all necessary aspects of the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event by referencing the official transcript and other sources, ensuring that the analysis is based on concrete evidence. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"No\" (p1) is aligned with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response effectively uses the sources mentioned to substantiate its findings and conclusions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns with the verified facts and the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions, uses logical reasoning, and aligns the recommendation with verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively analyzes the transcript and other sources to confirm the non-usage of the term 'Biden' explicitly, leading to a correct resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932016 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:46:56 UTC",
