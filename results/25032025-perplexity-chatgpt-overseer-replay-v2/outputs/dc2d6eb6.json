        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Jai Herbert vs. Chris Padilla fight at UFC Fight Night on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Herbert wins, it's p2; if Padilla wins, p1; and if it's a draw or unresolved, p3. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the event date, so the fight should have already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the actual outcome. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. Source [1] from Sherdog mentions that Padilla won via split decision (29-28, 29-28, 28-29). This directly states the result.\n2. Source [2] lists the fight card but doesn't give the result. However, source [6] from MMA Decisions confirms the result as a split decision win for Padilla with the judges' scores.\n3. Source [7] is a YouTube video transcript that also mentions Padilla getting the nod on two scorecards.\n4. Source [8] includes photos from the event with a caption stating Padilla's split decision win.\n\nAll these sources consistently report that Chris Padilla won the fight by split decision. There's no mention of the fight being postponed, canceled, or a draw. The resolution conditions state that the source should be ESPN, but a consensus of credible reporting can be used. Sherdog, MMA Junkie, and MMA Decisions are credible MMA news outlets, so their reports are reliable.\n\nSince the event date is in the past and multiple sources confirm Padilla's victory, the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information, and all evidence points to Padilla being declared the winner.\n</think>\n\nChris Padilla defeated Jai Herbert via split decision (29-28, 29-28, 28-29) at UFC Fight Night 255 on March 22, 2025, as reported by multiple credible sources covering the event[1][6][7][8]. The bout proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, and the official result was determined by judges' scoring with no indication of a draw or unresolved outcome[1][6]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Jai Herbert vs. Chris Padilla fight at UFC Fight Night on March 22, 2025) and the date of the event relative to the current timestamp, which is March 25, 2025. The AI checks multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the fight, which is a key requirement of the system prompt. The sources mentioned (Sherdog, MMA Decisions, and a YouTube video transcript) are credible within the context of MMA reporting. The AI also correctly adheres to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt by using a consensus of credible reporting to confirm the outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with a verification of the event date and proceeding to source verification of the fight's outcome. The AI provides a detailed account of the sources checked and the information each source provided, ensuring a thorough verification process. The reasoning is sound, with a clear path from the event details to the final recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms that the event occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It verifies the outcome of the event through multiple independent sources, all of which agree on Chris Padilla winning by split decision. This aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a win by Padilla corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI does not rely on a single source but corroborates the outcome across several reputable sources. It also correctly ignores any irrelevant information and focuses solely on the event and its outcome as specified in the prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the query based on the provided conditions and factual information.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple credible sources, adheres to the resolution conditions, and logically presents the information leading to a correct and well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses credible sources to confirm the event outcome and aligns perfectly with the user prompt's resolution conditions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923629 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:27:09 UTC"
