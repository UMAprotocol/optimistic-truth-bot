The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Duke vs. Louisville basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Duke wins, it's p1; if Louisville wins, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The search results mention the game took place on March 15, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 25, 2025. So the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, checking the outcome. Multiple sources ([1], [3], [5], [10], [11], [13]) report that Duke won the game 73-62. For example, source [1] states Duke defeated Louisville 73-62 to claim the ACC Tournament title. Source [3] also confirms the score and mentions Duke's victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources agree the game was played as scheduled with Duke as the winner.\n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. All sources consistently report Duke's win. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. The game was part of the ACC Tournament, and the results are well-documented across reputable sports websites and the universities' official pages.\n\nSince the game was played on the scheduled date and Duke won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. There's no ambiguity here. The market should resolve to Duke (p1).\n</think>\n\nDuke defeated Louisville 73-62 in the ACC Tournament championship game on March 15, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources including official team reports[1][3][5][10][13] and ESPN's game summary[11]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. According to the resolution conditions, since Duke won, the market resolves to **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate and complete in its analysis and recommendation based on the user prompt and the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Duke vs. Louisville basketball game) occurred on March 15, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The response verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all agree that Duke won the game. This is in line with the system prompt's requirement to use verified facts and concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds through the necessary checks: confirming the event's occurrence, verifying the outcome, and ensuring there were no postponements or cancellations. It then aligns the verified outcome with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which correctly leads to the recommendation of p1 (Duke win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources. It aligns the recommendation (p1 for a Duke win) directly with the facts verified and the conditions outlined in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not show any unnecessary bias towards unverified sources or speculative information. It sticks strictly to the verified outcomes necessary for resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the provided instructions. There is no need for a rerun or default to p4, as the response confidently resolves the query with a high degree of reliability.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions without any errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, providing a well-reasoned and fact-based resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
