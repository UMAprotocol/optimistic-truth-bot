        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Ethereum\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The updates mention that the video address counts, so even though it's a recorded message, it's valid.\n\nFirst, I need to check all the search results for mentions of Trump's speech. Let's go through each source. \n\nLooking at [1], the article mentions Trump's speech but doesn't list Ethereum. He talked about Bitcoin and stablecoins. [2] also discusses Bitcoin and stablecoin legislation, no mention of Ethereum. [3] says the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve includes Ethereum, but that's from an executive order, not the speech. [4] and [5] focus on Bitcoin and the reserve, no Ethereum in the speech. \n\n[6] and [7] again discuss Bitcoin and policies, but no direct quote of \"Ethereum\" in the speech. [8] and [9] mention the speech but not Ethereum. [10] has a transcript where Trump doesn't say Ethereum. [11] talks about Trump's social media post including Ethereum, but that's not the speech. [12] mentions the government holds Ethereum, but that's from an executive order, not the speech. [13] and [14] focus on Bitcoin. [15] and [16] summarize the speech without mentioning Ethereum.\n\nWait, in [11], Trump's Truth Social post mentions Ethereum, but the user's query specifies the speech at the summit. The social media post is a different context. The speech itself, according to the transcripts in [9] and [10], doesn't include the word \"Ethereum\". The key point is whether he said it during the speech. All the sources that cover the speech content don't mention him uttering \"Ethereum\". Therefore, the answer should be No, p1.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump delivered a video address at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) on March 20, 2025, focusing on Bitcoin, stablecoin legislation, and U.S. crypto leadership. The speech emphasized initiatives like the **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** and ending regulatory crackdowns[1][2][6][15]. While Trump referenced Bitcoin repeatedly and called for stablecoin regulation, **no search results indicate he used the term \"Ethereum\" during the speech**[1][2][6][9][10][15]. \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that **any usage of \"Ethereum\" in the main speech or immediate Q&A** would trigger a \"Yes\" outcome. However, transcripts and summaries of the event confirm Trump\u2019s remarks centered on Bitcoin, stablecoins, and broader crypto policy without mentioning Ethereum[9][10][14][16]. Although Trump\u2019s March 2 social media post mentioned Ethereum[11], this occurred weeks before the summit and falls outside the defined scope of the speech. \n\nGiven the evidence, the market resolves to **No** as the term \"Ethereum\" was not used in the qualifying context. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions by focusing solely on whether Donald Trump mentioned the term \"Ethereum\" during his speech at the Digital Asset Summit on March 20, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the term \"Ethereum\" must be used during the speech or immediate Q&A to count towards a \"Yes\" resolution. The response also correctly excludes references to Ethereum outside of this context, such as Trump's social media post, which is consistent with the user prompt's conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking multiple sources for any mention of the term \"Ethereum\" during Trump's speech. It lists various sources that confirm the absence of the term \"Ethereum\" in the speech, focusing instead on Bitcoin and stablecoins. This thorough search across multiple sources ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the speech content.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and that the resolution source, a video of the speech, is appropriate and aligns with the user prompt's requirements. The recommendation of \"p1\" (No) is directly supported by the evidence provided, which consistently shows that \"Ethereum\" was not mentioned during the relevant parts of the event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response effectively uses the information available and adheres strictly to the user prompt's conditions without introducing irrelevant or unsupported information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the user prompt. The recommendation aligns with the evidence gathered and analyzed.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, provides a thorough analysis based on multiple sources, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the established facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively addresses all requirements and conditions specified in the user prompt, ensuring a reliable and accurate resolution.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906530 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:42:10 UTC",
