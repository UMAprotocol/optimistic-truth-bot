        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump issued an executive order on March 16, 2025, based on the provided search results. The resolution conditions state that the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if an executive order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or the press pool by the deadline. Otherwise, it's \"No\" (p1). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of an executive order on March 16. Let's go through each source. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [9] from ABC News mentions that Trump signed an executive order on Saturday, March 15, 2025, rescinding 19 Biden-era actions. However, March 15 is a Saturday, and the next day is March 16. The article also mentions that this brings the total number of rescinded actions to nearly 100. But the key here is the date. The executive order was signed on the 15th, not the 16th. \n\nResult [13] from Axios discusses the White House defying a court order related to deportations. It mentions that Trump signed an executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act on Friday night (March 14) and that flights were carried out on Saturday, March 15. The court order blocking the deportations came on March 15 as well. The article doesn't mention any executive order signed on March 16. \n\nResult [15] from Daily Kos references an executive order on March 15 titled \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua.\" The order was signed on March 15, and the flights occurred on March 16. However, the executive order itself was signed the day before. \n\nResult [9] also notes that the White House asked a court to stay a TRO on March 16, but that's a legal action, not an executive order. \n\nChecking the White House's presidential actions page in result [1] and [2], the latest executive orders listed are from March 14 and earlier. The page 2 of presidential actions includes entries up to March 7, 2025, but nothing on March 16. \n\nResult [16] mentions an executive order signed on Thursday, March 20, 2025, to dismantle the Department of Education, which is after the date in question. \n\nNone of the other search results mention an executive order published on March 16. The key here is the publication date on the White House site. Since the executive orders mentioned around that time were on March 14 and 15, and the next one is on March 20, there's no evidence of an executive order published on March 16. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It correctly identifies that the event in question is whether Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 16, 2025. The response checks the specified sources (White House presidential actions page and press pool) and correctly concludes that no executive order was issued on that date based on the absence of records on these sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking each relevant date around March 16, 2025, for the issuance of an executive order. It methodically dismisses the days before and after when executive orders were signed, confirming that none were signed on the specified date. This thorough check enhances the completeness of the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the non-occurrence of the event by consulting the specified URLs and other credible news sources. It aligns perfectly with the facts as no executive order was found on the White House page or press pool for March 16, 2025. The recommendation of \"p1\" (No) is correctly aligned with these findings.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI has covered the necessary bases by checking the dates immediately around March 16 and confirming the absence of an executive order on the specified date.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the verification process is thorough, leading to a well-supported recommendation.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the instructions, logically checks the relevant sources, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the specified sources to verify the absence of an executive order on the specified date and provides a clear and accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932214 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:50:14 UTC",
