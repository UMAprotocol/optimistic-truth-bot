        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Trans\" during his Kennedy Center event on March 17, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key here is to look for any instance where Trump used the exact term \"Trans\" during that event. The ancillary data specifies that any usage, including plural or possessive forms, counts, but other forms don't. Also, compound words like \"Transgender\" would count if \"Trans\" is part of it.\n\nLooking through the search results, most of them discuss Trump's actions at the Kennedy Center, his criticism of \"woke\" programming, drag shows, and his overhaul of the board. Several sources mention his opposition to LGBTQ+ events, including drag shows and trans-related content. For example, sources [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], and [15] talk about his stance against drag shows and trans rights, but do they mention him using the word \"Trans\" during the specific event?\n\nThe event in question is the board meeting on March 17. The search results [1], [2], [4], [6], [7], [8], [16], [17] detail his visit and statements made that day. In the transcripts from the press gaggles (sources [16] and [17]), Trump talks about the disrepair, changes to the center, and his plans, but there's no mention of him saying \"Trans.\" \n\nSome sources mention his previous statements about banning drag shows and trans-related content, like in [18] and [20], but those are from February, not during the March 17 event. The updates in the query mention that Q&A sessions count, so I need to check if any Q&A during the event included the term. The transcripts from the press interactions (sources [16] and [17]) don't show him using \"Trans.\" \n\nEven though there's significant context about his administration's policies against trans rights and drag shows, the specific term \"Trans\" isn't cited in the March 17 event's coverage. Therefore, based on the provided sources, Trump didn't say \"Trans\" during that particular appearance.\n</think>\n\nBased on analysis of available video transcripts and reports from President Trump's March 17, 2025 Kennedy Center board meeting and tour, there is no evidence that he uttered the word \"Trans\" during the event. While the president made multiple references to opposing \"woke\" programming and drag shows[3][9][18], none of the verified transcripts or contemporaneous news reports contain any instance of Trump using the specific term \"Trans\" in any context during this appearance[1][4][16][17].\n\nKey points from the appearance:\n- Trump focused criticism on physical disrepair: \"It's in tremendous disrepair... we're going to fix it\"[1][7][16]\n- Discussed programming changes: \"No more woke content or drag shows\"[6][18]\n- Addressed leadership changes: \"We've taken control of it\"[5]\n- Fielded questions about VP Vance's reception and renovation costs[16][17]\n\nWhile the president's broader policy agenda includes anti-trans measures[9][12], the specific March 17 event contained no direct references to transgender issues using the required term. All verified transcripts show Trump using terms like \"drag,\" \"woke,\" and \"radical left\" rather than \"Trans\"[16][17][18].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions by focusing on whether Donald Trump used the term \"Trans\" during his appearance at the Kennedy Center on March 17, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends on Trump's usage of the term during this specific event and correctly disregards any usage of the term outside this event.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically searching through the event's transcripts and related news sources to check for the usage of the term \"Trans.\" It correctly concludes that despite Trump's known positions on related topics, he did not use the term \"Trans\" during the event. The response also correctly includes details about what was actually said during the event, which supports the conclusion drawn.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the occurrence of the event and aligns its recommendation with the facts gathered from the event's coverage. The recommendation of \"p1\" (No) is based on the absence of the term \"Trans\" in any verified transcripts or reports from the event, which aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or significant missing information in the response. The response thoroughly checks the relevant sources and bases its conclusion on the evidence available from those sources.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns correctly with the established facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt instructions, demonstrates logical reasoning, verifies the event properly, and aligns the recommendation with the facts. No significant errors, bias, or missing information were found.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used the provided sources to confirm the absence of the term 'Trans' during the event and made a correct market resolution recommendation based on the evidence.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930269 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:17:49 UTC",
