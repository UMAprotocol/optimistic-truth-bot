        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Nashville Predators vs. Los Angeles Kings game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1; if the Predators win, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event should have already happened. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game on March 15. \n\nSearch result [5] from NHL.com states that the Kings won 1-0 in overtime. Similarly, [9], [10], [11], [12], [14], and [15] all confirm the Kings' victory with a 1-0 score in overtime. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. In fact, [7] talks about a different game in January being postponed due to wildfires, but that's unrelated to March 15. \n\nThe user's resolution conditions say a Kings win is p1. All the sources agree the Kings won, so the market should resolve to p1. There's no indication of cancellation or postponement, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Nashville Predators and Los Angeles Kings played their scheduled game on March 15, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena. The Los Angeles Kings won 1-0 in overtime, with Quinton Byfield scoring the decisive goal at 3:20 of the extra period[5][9][10][14]. This victory extended the Kings' winning streak to five games and improved their home record to 9-0-2 in their last 11 contests[5][10]. \n\nGoaltender Darcy Kuemper recorded a 24-save shutout for Los Angeles, while Nashville's Justus Annunen made 20 saves in the losing effort[5][14]. The game proceeded without postponement or cancellation, as evidenced by multiple detailed recaps and video highlights of the completed match[11][12][15]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to \"Kings\" (p1) as the decisive outcome occurred per the ancillary terms.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742922968 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:16:08 UTC"
