The ancillary data specifies that if SMU wins, it's p1; Northern Iowa, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 19 is in the past. That means I need to verify the actual outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [3], [4], [5], [8], [9]) report that SMU won the game 73-63. For example, source [1] from ESPN clearly states the final score and that SMU advanced to the next round. Source [4] from UNI's own site confirms the loss, and source [5] mentions SMU's win despite a player injury. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources agree the game was played as scheduled. Since SMU won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources align on the outcome, so no discrepancies. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe SMU Mustangs defeated the Northern Iowa Panthers 73-63 in the NIT first-round game played on March 19, 2025.

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Northern Iowa vs. SMU game occurred on March 19, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past event. The response correctly states that SMU won the game with a score of 73-63, as confirmed by multiple reliable sources. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a win by SMU corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm it is a past event. It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the game through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The response also checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled, which there were none, thus adhering to the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is accurate and aligns with the facts. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 is based on the verified outcome that SMU won the game.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, and there is a clear verification of the event's outcome without any discrepancies.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Northern Iowa vs. SMU game and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929336 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:02:16 UTC"
