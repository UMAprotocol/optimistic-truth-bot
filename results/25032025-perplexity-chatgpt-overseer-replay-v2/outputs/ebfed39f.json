The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Kansas vs. Arizona college basketball game that was scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Arizona wins, it resolves to p1, Kansas to p2, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the date of the event. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 13 is in the past. That means the event has already occurred, so no need to check for postponement or future dates. \n\nNext, I need to look through the search results to determine the outcome. The search results are from March 13 and 14, 2025. Multiple sources ([1], [2], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]) report that Arizona defeated Kansas 88-77 in the Big 12 Conference Tournament quarterfinal. For example, source [1] states, \"Arizona cruised to an 88-77 victory over the Jayhawks,\" and source [11] from ESPN confirms the same score. \n\nI should check if there's any conflicting information, but all sources consistently report Arizona's win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that a win by Arizona corresponds to p1. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also need to ensure that the event in question is the same one mentioned in the ancillary data. The date and teams match, so it's the correct game. No discrepancies there. \n\nSince the event occurred as scheduled and Arizona won, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Kansas vs. Arizona men's college basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET concluded with **Arizona defeating Kansas 88-77** in the Big 12 Conference Tournament quarterfinals. Multiple sources confirm Arizona maintained control for most of the game, with Henri Veesaar and KJ Lewis each scoring 19 points off the bench[1][2][6][11]. Kansas briefly led twice in the second half but couldn't sustain momentum against Arizona's depth and 53.4% field goal shooting[1][12].\n\n**Key details**:\n- Arizona's bench outscored Kansas' reserves 38-13[1][6]\n- Wildcats shot 53.4% from the field, the highest allowed by Kansas all season[1]\n- Zeke Mayo led Kansas with 20 points, his third straight 20+ point game[1][2]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations reported. Based on the resolution conditions and verified outcome:\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926041 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:07:21 UTC"
