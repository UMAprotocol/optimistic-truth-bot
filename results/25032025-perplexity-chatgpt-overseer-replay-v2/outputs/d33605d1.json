The ancillary data specifies that if Arkansas wins, it's p2; St. John's is p1, and canceled games are p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 22) is in the past. That means I need to verify the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Source [1] from St. John's official site states they lost 75-66 to Arkansas. Source [5] from Arkansas's site also confirms their victory. ESPN's recap [11] and other articles [2], [6], [8], [13] all report Arkansas's win. \n\nThe user's query mentions resolution conditions: p2 for Arkansas. Since the game wasn't postponed or canceled, and Arkansas won, the correct resolution is p2. All sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. No need to consider p3 or p1. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament game between Arkansas and St. John's occurred on March 22, 2025, as scheduled. **Arkansas defeated St. John's 75-66**[1][5][11], advancing to the Sweet 16. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is definitively verified through multiple sources, including official team reports[1][5], ESPN\u2019s recap[11], and sports media coverage[2][6][8]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **p2 (Arkansas)**. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Arkansas vs. St. John's CBB game) occurred on March 22, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event date in the past. The AI then verifies the outcome of the game using multiple reliable sources, which all confirm that Arkansas won the game. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where Arkansas winning corresponds to p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the event's occurrence and outcome. It confirms that the game was neither postponed nor canceled, which matches the conditions provided for resolution. The AI uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring the response is well-supported and robust against potential misinformation or source errors.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's recommendation to resolve the market to p2 (Arkansas) is based on verified facts that Arkansas won the game. This recommendation directly aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI strictly adheres to the user prompt and system prompt instructions without adding unnecessary information or making unfounded assumptions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926414 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:13:34 UTC"
