        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether Justin Trudeau ceased to be Prime Minister of Canada in 2025. The ancillary data specifies that \"Yes\" (p2) is the outcome if he left office between January 1 and December 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for evidence of Trudeau's resignation. Looking at the sources, multiple articles confirm his resignation. For example, source [1] states he announced his resignation on January 6, 2025, and source [3] mentions his resignation took effect by March 24, 2025. Other sources like [5], [7], [10], [12], and [13] all corroborate his resignation within the specified timeframe. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the event occurred within the given dates. The resignation announcement was on January 6, 2025, and he remained in office until his successor was chosen. Source [14] mentions Mark Carney was elected as the new leader on March 9, 2025, and Trudeau's departure was set for March 24. Since both dates fall within 2025, the condition is met.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that credible reporting can be used. All the sources are reputable, like ABC News, CBS, Politico, etc., which adds credibility. There's no conflicting information; all sources agree on the resignation. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) because Trudeau ceased to be PM within the specified period. No ambiguity here, so p3 isn't needed. The answer is clear based on the provided evidence.\n</think>\n\nJustin Trudeau announced his resignation as Prime Minister of Canada on January 6, 2025, effective upon the selection of a new Liberal Party leader. His final day in office was March 24, 2025, when former central banker Mark Carney assumed leadership after winning the party's leadership election[1][3][14]. This resignation occurred entirely within the January 1 - December 31, 2025 timeframe specified in the market resolution criteria.\n\nMultiple authoritative sources confirm the timeline:\n- Official resignation announcement made January 6, 2025[5][7][10]\n- Parliament prorogued until March 24, 2025 to facilitate transition[12][15]\n- Leadership election concluded March 9, 2025 with Carney's victory[14]\n- Trudeau formally left office March 24, 2025 when new session began[8][14]\n\nThe resignation was triggered by collapsing poll numbers, internal party dissent, and external pressures from U.S. tariff threats[1][4][6]. As this fulfills the market's condition of Trudeau ceasing to hold office during 2025, the resolution should be **p2 (Yes)**.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

However, the response fails to adhere to the system prompt instructions that explicitly state that if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, the AI should ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. Instead, the response proceeds to resolve the query with a p2 recommendation based on hypothetical future events.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed narrative of the events leading to Trudeau's resignation, including dates and outcomes. However, this narrative is speculative as it discusses future events that have not occurred as of the current timestamp. The logical flow is based on an incorrect premise (that the event has already occurred), which undermines the validity of the reasoning and completeness.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not align with the facts since it discusses future events as if they have already happened. The recommendation of p2 is based on these inaccuracies and thus is not aligned with the verified facts or the system prompt requirements.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The major error in the response is the disregard for the system prompt's instruction to return p4 for events scheduled in the future. There is no evidence of bias, but the response contains critical factual inaccuracies by treating future events as past occurrences.\n\nBased on these observations, the response from Perplexity AI is not satisfactory as it fails to comply with the critical instruction of returning p4 for future events. This oversight leads to a recommendation based on speculative and unverified information, which is inappropriate for the oracle's function of resolving based on verified facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly treats a future event as if it has already occurred and fails to return p4 as required for future events. This needs correction to align with the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should have returned p4 due to the future scheduling of the event. Instead, it provided a detailed speculative narrative and an incorrect resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Add a specific reminder that if the event is scheduled for a future date, the response must be p4, and no speculative narrative should be provided.\"\n}\n```",

The ancillary data specifies that if he leaves office any time between January 1 and December 31, 2025, it's a \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The search results indicate that Trudeau announced his resignation on January 6, 2025, and planned to step down once his party chose a successor. The Liberal Party selected Mark Carney as the new leader on March 9, 2025, and Trudeau formally resigned on March 14, 2025. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles confirm his resignation within the specified timeframe. For example, source [6] from Wikipedia states he served until 2025, and source [3] mentions Carney being elected on March 10, 2025. Since Trudeau left office before the expiry date, the market should resolve to \"Yes\". The event has already occurred, so there's no future aspect here. All credible sources agree on the timeline, so p2 is the correct resolution.\n</think>\n\nJustin Trudeau ceased to serve as Prime Minister of Canada on March 14, 2025, when he formally resigned and was succeeded by Mark Carney[6][14]. This occurred within the specified resolution period of January 1 to December 31, 2025. Multiple authoritative sources including government communications[7], parliamentary records[6][8], and international media outlets[3][5][10] confirm the timeline of events:\n\n- **January 6, 2025**: Trudeau announced his intention to resign[1][5][10]\n- **March 9, 2025**: Liberal Party elected Mark Carney as new leader[3][6]\n- **March 14, 2025**: Formal resignation and transition of power[6]\n\nThe resignation meets all conditions outlined in the ancillary data, as it occurred before the December 31, 2025 deadline and was verified through official government processes[6][8] and consensus reporting[3][5][10]. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response also correctly identifies the resolution condition that if Trudeau ceases to be Prime Minister within this period, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n\nThe response provides a detailed timeline of events leading up to Trudeau's resignation, citing multiple sources that confirm the resignation occurred on March 14, 2025, after Trudeau announced his intention to resign on January 6, 2025. The Liberal Party elected Mark Carney as the new leader on March 9, 2025, which aligns with the information provided in the user prompt. The response uses credible sources such as government communications, parliamentary records, and international media outlets to verify these events.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it directly connects the verified events to the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data. The response does not include speculative narrative or irrelevant information, focusing solely on the facts required to resolve the query.\n\nThere are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The response strictly adheres to the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts, without venturing into predictions or assumptions about future events.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response appears to be satisfactory.
