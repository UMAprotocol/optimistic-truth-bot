The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14, so the game should have happened. Now, looking at the search results, especially [1] and [4], both mention the game on March 14. \n\nIn [1], the detailed recap states that the Raptors won 126-118. Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley each scored 20 points. The Jazz had an eight-game losing streak, which aligns with the result. The box score in [4] also confirms the final score: Raptors 126, Jazz 118. \n\nOther sources like [2] and [5] are predictions before the game, so they're not relevant for the outcome. [7] is a video highlight, but the transcript mentions the Raptors scoring, supporting the win. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if the Raptors win, it's p2. Since the game occurred and the Raptors won, the resolution should be p2. No signs of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirm the Raptors' victory, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and Utah Jazz scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET concluded with the **Raptors defeating the Jazz 126-118**[1][4]. Key contributors included Scottie Barnes (20 points, 10 rebounds) and Immanuel Quickley (20 points), while Utah's Jordan Clarkson led their scoring with 19 points[1]. The game's outcome was confirmed through multiple verified sources, including detailed box scores and recaps[1][4][7]. \n\nSince the event occurred as scheduled and the Raptors secured a victory, the market resolves to **\"Raptors\"** per the ancillary data's resolution conditions. There is no indication of postponement or cancellation affecting this result.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The AI used verified sources to confirm the outcome of the game, where the Toronto Raptors defeated the Utah Jazz with a score of 126-118. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a Raptors win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks the date to confirm the event has occurred, searches for verified sources to ascertain the outcome, and cross-references multiple sources to ensure the accuracy of the game's result. The response excludes irrelevant predictive sources and focuses on factual recaps and box scores to determine the outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Raptors\" (p2) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI effectively uses the relevant information and disregards non-factual data such as predictions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response adheres to the system prompt instructions, accurately verifies the event based on reliable sources, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the verified facts and specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the specified resolution conditions without any significant errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, ensuring factual accuracy and completeness in verifying the event and providing a resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
