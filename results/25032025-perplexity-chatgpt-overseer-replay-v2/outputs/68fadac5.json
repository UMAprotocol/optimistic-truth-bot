The ancillary data specifies that if the Sharks win, it's p1; Bruins win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Checking the search results, multiple sources mention the game. \n\nLooking at source [1], the final score is Bruins 1, Sharks 1, but that seems conflicting. Wait, source [3] says Sharks won 3-1 with goals from Eklund, Carlsson, and Goodrow. Source [5] also mentions a 3-1 Sharks victory. Source [7] and [8] confirm the Sharks won 3-1. There's some inconsistency in [1]'s table showing a tie, but other sources are clear. \n\nThe discrepancy in [1] might be a formatting error. The detailed reports in [3], [5], [7], and [8] all state Sharks 3-1. Also, source [7] explains the Bruins' coach didn't challenge an offside call leading to the Sharks' winning goal. \n\nSince the game occurred on March 22 and the Sharks won 3-1, the resolution should be p1. The ancillary data maps Sharks win to p1. No postponement or cancellation mentioned, so p3 isn't applicable. All reliable sources confirm the Sharks' victory.\n</think>\n\nThe Boston Bruins and San Jose Sharks played their NHL game on March 22, 2025, as scheduled. The San Jose Sharks won the game 3-1, with goals from William Eklund (16th of the season), Lucas Carlsson (1st), and Barclay Goodrow (5th)[3][5][7][8]. Boston's lone goal came from Casey Mittelstadt[3][7]. Despite a controversial offside call on San Jose's game-winning goal that was not challenged by Boston's coaching staff[7], the result stood as a Sharks victory.\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Sharks 3, Bruins 1[3][5][7][8]\n- Sharks goaltender Alexandar Georgiev made 22 saves on 23 shots[3]\n- Bruins' 14-game winning streak against San Jose was snapped[7]\n\nThe game was completed without postponement or cancellation, and the Sharks' victory meets the resolution criteria specified in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the query based on the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Bruins vs. Sharks game) occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which consistently report a Sharks victory with a score of 3-1. This aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Sharks win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks for the game's outcome and confirms there was no postponement or cancellation, which would have affected the resolution. It addresses a potential discrepancy in the sources effectively by cross-verifying with multiple reports, thus ensuring the recommendation is based on a consensus among reliable sources rather than an isolated error.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response ensures that the event discussed is the exact event mentioned in the user prompt. It uses the correct date and details, and the final recommendation of p1 for a Sharks win is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response does not show any unjustified assumptions or reliance on unverified information.\n\nGiven the above points, the response is both accurate and complete, adhering strictly to the system prompt instructions. The logical flow from event verification to the final recommendation is clear and well-supported by the cited sources.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the event's outcome, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
