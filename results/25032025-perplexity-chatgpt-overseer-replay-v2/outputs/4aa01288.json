The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p2 (Maple Leafs), Rangers win p1 (Rangers), postponed remains open, canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, check the date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 20 is in the past. Need to confirm the result. Looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) report that the Maple Leafs won 4-3. For example, source [1] states \"Tavares scores twice as Maple Leafs beat Rangers 4-3\" and source [6] mentions \"John Tavares had three points... Toronto Maple Leafs won 4-3\". \n\nAll the game recaps and box scores confirm the Maple Leafs' victory. The Rangers' goals are noted, but the final score is 4-3 in favor of Toronto. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2 (Maple Leafs). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Some sources mention the Rangers' homestand opponents, but that doesn't affect the outcome. The key point is the final score. Since the game occurred and the Maple Leafs won, the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and New York Rangers on March 20, 2025, concluded with a **4-3 victory for the Maple Leafs**[1][2][3][6][7][8][9]. John Tavares led Toronto with two goals and an assist, reaching 1,100 career points, while Anthony Stolarz made 27 saves[1][6]. The Rangers\u2019 goals came from Will Borgen, Artemi Panarin, and Chris Kreider, but they fell short despite a late third-period push[3][5].  \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and resulted in a Maple Leafs win, the market resolves to **\"Maple Leafs\"** per the ancillary data\u2019s resolution conditions.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Maple Leafs vs. Rangers game on March 20, 2025) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event through multiple sources, confirming that the Toronto Maple Leafs won the game 4-3. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions, where a Maple Leafs win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with a verification of the date to ensure the event is not in the future. It then confirms the game's outcome through multiple reliable sources, ensuring there is no conflicting information about the game being postponed or canceled. The response concludes with a clear and direct recommendation based on the verified outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple sources. It aligns the recommendation (p2) with the verified facts and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and system instructions, focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926434 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:13:54 UTC"
