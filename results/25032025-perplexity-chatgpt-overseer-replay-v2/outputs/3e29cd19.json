The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Milwaukee Bucks game scheduled for March 16, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Thunder win, it's p2; if the Bucks win, p1; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event is in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources (9, 10, 14, 16) confirm that the Thunder won the game. For example, source [9] states the Thunder secured a 121-105 victory. Source [10] from the Associated Press also reports the Thunder's win with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leading the team. Additionally, source [16] mentions the Thunder improved their record to 27-7 on the road after this win. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in the results. All sources point to the game being played as scheduled with a clear result. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since the Thunder won, the market should resolve to p2. \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All the relevant sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The game wasn't affected by weather or other issues, as there's no indication of postponement or cancellation in the search results related to this specific game. \n\nThus, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 121-105 in their March 16, 2025, NBA game. Multiple sources confirm the Thunder secured a decisive victory, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s 31 points and eight assists, alongside Isaiah Hartenstein\u2019s career-high 24 points and 12 rebounds[9][10][14][16]. The game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with the Thunder maintaining control after a dominant second quarter[10][14].  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- **Final score:** Thunder 121, Bucks 105[9][10][13]  \n- **Game status:** Played to completion on March 16, 2025[10][13]  \n- **Market resolution:** Per the ancillary data, the Thunder\u2019s win triggers a **p2** resolution[9][10].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927381 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:29:41 UTC"
