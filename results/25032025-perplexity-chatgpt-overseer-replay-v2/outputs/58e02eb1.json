        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" based on whether David Sacks was appointed to the Trump administration by January 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the deadline of January 31 has passed. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources mention that Trump appointed Sacks as the \"AI & Crypto Czar\" in December 2024. For example, source [1] states that Sacks was given the role in December 2024, and source [11] from Wikipedia confirms the appointment date. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that the appointment must be made by January 31, 2025. Since December 2024 is before that deadline, the condition is met. Also, the role is part of the administration as a special government employee, which fits the definition provided in the resolution conditions, even if it's a part-time role without Senate confirmation. \n\nThere's no indication that Trump lost the election; in fact, sources refer to him as President-elect and later President. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). The only potential hiccup could be if the appointment wasn't official, but sources like Axios and TIME cite official announcements from Trump via Truth Social, which counts as an official channel. \n\nAdditionally, sources [3] and [10] mention Sacks' ongoing role and ethics waivers in March 2025, confirming his continued position. All criteria are met: Trump won, Sacks was appointed before the deadline, and the role is within the administration.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump won the 2024 presidential election and officially appointed David Sacks as White House AI & Crypto Czar on December 5, 2024[1][2][6][9][11]. This role was created as part of the Trump administration, with Sacks serving as a \"special government employee\" advising on AI, cryptocurrency policy, and leading the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology[2][7][12]. \n\nKey facts confirming the appointment:\n- The announcement was made through Trump's official Truth Social account[2][6][9]\n- Sacks began divesting crypto assets in March 2025 to comply with ethics rules while maintaining his role[3][10]\n- Multiple government memorandums reference his position and responsibilities[8][10]\n- Wikipedia and official White House sources list him as holding this administration role[11][12]\n\nThe appointment occurred well before the January 31, 2025 deadline specified in the market resolution criteria. While Sacks maintains some private sector ties through his venture capital firm, his government role qualifies as an official administration position under the market's definition[2][11].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

It confirms that David Sacks was appointed before the deadline and provides multiple sources to substantiate this claim. The role of \"AI & Crypto Czar\" fits within the administration as defined by the user prompt. The response also correctly notes that Trump won the 2024 election, which is a necessary condition for the market to resolve to \"Yes.\"\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically connects the facts to the conditions outlined in the user prompt. It verifies that the appointment was officially announced and that Sacks began divesting assets to comply with ethics rules, further confirming his active role in the administration. The response also addresses potential concerns about the official nature of the appointment and Sacks' ongoing role, reinforcing the resolution with multiple sources.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event of Sacks' appointment through credible sources, including official announcements and government memorandums. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Yes\" (p2) aligns perfectly with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742922438 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:07:18 UTC",
