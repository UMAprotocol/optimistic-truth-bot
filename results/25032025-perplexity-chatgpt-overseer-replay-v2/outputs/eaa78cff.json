        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Drone\" during her next White House press briefing before December 31, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if she does, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any information about upcoming briefings. The current date is March 25, 2025. The search results provided are all from January and February 2025. There's no mention of any press briefings scheduled after March 25. \n\nLooking at the search results, Leavitt has participated in several briefings where she discussed drones, especially the New Jersey drone incidents. She used the term \"drone\" multiple times in those briefings. However, all these instances are from before March 2025. \n\nThe query's resolution depends on the next briefing she participates in. Since there's no information about any briefings after March 25, and the cutoff is December 31, 2025, we can't confirm if she will have another briefing. Also, the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing occurs by the end of 2025. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if Leavitt ceases to be press secretary before the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". There's no indication in the search results that she has left her position, but we don't have any data beyond February 2025. \n\nSince the next briefing's occurrence is uncertain and there's no evidence of it happening yet, the safest conclusion is that unless a briefing is confirmed and she says \"drone\", the market would resolve to \"No\". However, based on past behavior, she might mention drones again if the topic comes up. But without confirmation of a future briefing, we can't assume it will happen. \n\nTherefore, considering the current information and the resolution rules, the answer should be \"No\" (p1) because there's no confirmed future briefing where she says \"drone\" yet, and the deadline hasn't passed. But wait, the user is asking for a prediction based on available data. The problem is that the market is still open until December 2025. However, the current date in the scenario is March 2025, and the user is asking as of now. Since there's no information about future briefings, and the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by the end of 2025, but we don't know if any will occur. However, the user's current timestamp is March 25, 2025, and the query is about whether she will say \"drone\" in the next briefing after this date. \n\nBut according to the rules, if the event hasn't occurred yet (the next briefing is in the future relative to March 25, 2025), then the resolution should be p4. Wait, the ancillary data says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the market's resolution is based on whether she says it in the next briefing, which hasn't happened yet. Since the event (the next briefing) is in the future, the correct recommendation is p4. But wait, the user's personalization instructions say: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". \n\nIn this case, the event is the next White House press briefing she participates in, which is a future event as of March 25, 2025. Therefore, regardless of past usage, since the event hasn't occurred yet, the recommendation should be p4. However, the market's resolution conditions state that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing is in the future, the event is pending. Therefore, according to the rules, the answer should be p4. \n\nBut wait, the user's query is about whether she will say \"drone\" in the next briefing. Since the next briefing is a future event, and we can't verify it yet, the recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution is based on whether it happens by the end of 2025. But the current date is March 2025, and the user is asking now. Since the event is in the future, the correct response is p4. \n\nBut looking back at the personalization instructions: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". The event here is the next press briefing, which is a future event. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response also correctly navigates through the conditions provided in the user prompt, such as the resolution of the market to \"No\" if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, or if Leavitt ceases to be White House press secretary.\n\nHowever, the response exhibits a significant amount of redundant and circular reasoning before arriving at the recommendation of p4. This verbosity could potentially confuse users or stakeholders relying on a concise and direct answer. The response could be improved by directly stating that the event is scheduled for a future date and, according to the rules provided, must return p4 without delving into unnecessary hypothetical scenarios or past events that do not impact the resolution as per the current query's requirements.\n\nFurthermore, the critical rule for this evaluation process states that if this is the first attempt and the recommendation is p4, a retry must always be initiated. This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining additional information or refining the search strategy are exhausted before settling on p4, which is a default position indicating unresolved status due to future scheduling of the event.\n\nGiven these considerations, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt with a p4 recommendation requires a retry to exhaust all possible search strategies and information sources.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response, while ultimately correct in its recommendation, included unnecessary and verbose reasoning.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Drone\" during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if she does, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if uncertain. The key here is to check if the event has already happened and if there's evidence of her using the word \"Drone\" in a briefing after March 25, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date provided, which is March 25, 2025. The search results include a briefing from March 19, 2025 (source [14]), where Leavitt discussed various topics like Ukraine and deportations. Looking at the transcript, she mentions \"deportation flight\" and other issues but doesn't use the word \"drone\" in the provided excerpts. \n\nNext, the next press briefing after March 19 would be the one in question. Since the current date is March 25, and the latest briefing mentioned is March 19, the next briefing hasn't occurred yet. The user's query is about the \"next\" briefing after March 25. However, all the search results provided are from January 2025, except for source [14] and [16], which are from March 19. There's no information about any briefings between March 25 and the user's current date. \n\nSince the event (the next briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to March 25, 2025, according to the rules, if the event is in the future, the resolution should be p4. Wait, but the ancillary data says if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to \"No\". However, the current timestamp is March 25, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet. Since the user is asking about the next briefing, which is after March 25, and there's no information available yet, the event is in the future. Therefore, per the instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut wait, the user's query is about whether she will say \"Drone\" in the next briefing. Since the next briefing hasn't occurred yet (as of March 25), and there's no data on it, the resolution should be p4. However, the ancillary data mentions that if no briefing happens by the end of 2025, it resolves to \"No\". But the user is asking about the next briefing, not whether any briefing occurs. Since the next briefing is in the future, and we can't verify it yet, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe query concerns whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"Drone\" during the next White House press briefing she participates in, with resolution conditions tied to verifiable occurrences of the term. The current date is **March 25, 2025**, and the most recent press briefing documented in the provided sources occurred on **March 19, 2025** [14]. During that briefing, Leavitt discussed topics such as U.S.-Ukraine relations, deportation policies, and federal funding freezes, but no mention of \"drone\" or related terms appears in the available transcripts or summaries [14].  \n\nThe \"next\" press briefing after March 19 would logically follow after the current timestamp of March 25. However, no search results provide evidence of a press briefing occurring between March 25 and the present query timestamp. Since the event in question (the next briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, and no verifiable information about its occurrence or content exists, the resolution defaults to **p4** under the defined rules.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "attempt": 3,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"Drone\" during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The resolution conditions are specific: p2 is Yes, p1 is No, and p3 is 50-50. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the market resolves to No if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer press secretary by then.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any information about the next scheduled press briefing involving Leavitt. The search results provided include several briefings up to March 17, 2025 (source [2]), and another on March 11, 2025 (source [15]). The most recent mention is a YouTube video from March 24, 2025 (source [13]), discussing a briefing about Ukraine, but there's no specific date for the next briefing after March 25. \n\nThe user's additional guidance emphasizes confirming if the event is scheduled for a future date. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and there's no information about a briefing scheduled after this date, the event in question (the next briefing) is in the future. According to the rules, if the event hasn't occurred yet, the recommendation should be p4. However, the resolution conditions here don't include p4, but the market resolves to No (p1) if the briefing doesn't happen by the end of 2025. \n\nWait, the market's ancillary data states that if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, it resolves to No (p1). But the user's personalization rules say to return p4 if the event is in the future. However, the query's resolution_conditions define p1 as No, p2 as Yes, and p3 as 0.5. The user's instructions mention that if the event is in the future, return p4, but the market's own conditions override that, specifying that unresolved by the end date resolves to No. \n\nBut the current date is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet. Since the market is about whether she will say \"Drone\" in the next briefing, which is a future event as of now, and there's no information that the briefing has occurred, the correct resolution according to the user's rules is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have a p4; they have p1, p2, p3. This is a conflict. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4. The user's instructions might have a mistake here. But according to the problem statement, the ancillary data defines the resolution as p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization rules state that if the event is in the future, return p4, but the market's own rules say it resolves to No if the event doesn't occur by the end of 2025. Since the event hasn't occurred yet, and it's still possible for a briefing to happen before December 31, the market is still open, so the correct resolution would be p3 (unknown/50-50). However, the user's personalization says to default to p4 if the event is in the future, but the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. The user might have intended p3 for unresolved cases, but the market's conditions specify p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50). However, the market's own rules state that if the event doesn't happen by the end date, it resolves to No (p1). Since the event (the next briefing) hasn't occurred yet, and it's possible it might happen in the future, but as of now, there's no information, the correct recommendation would be p4 according to the user's rules, but since the market doesn't have p4, perhaps p3 is appropriate. However, the user's instructions are conflicting here.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user's personalization rules take precedence. The user says to return p4 if the event is in the future, regardless of the market's conditions. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. But the user's personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. So despite the market's conditions, the user wants p4 if the event is future. \n\nGiven that the next briefing is a future event as of March 25, 2025, and there's no information about it happening yet, the recommendation should be p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. But the user's instructions say to follow their personalization rules strictly, so even if the market's conditions don't have p4, the answer should be p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions might have a typo, but the user's personalization says to return p4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that if the event is in the future, the market can't be resolved yet, hence p4, but the market's own rules say it resolves to No if not by end of 2025. But since the event hasn't occurred yet, and the current date is before the deadline, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This is a conflict. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" So regardless of the market's conditions, the user wants p4 if the event is future. Therefore, despite the market's resolution_conditions, the answer should be p4. \n\nBut the market's own rules state that if the event doesn't happen by the end date, it resolves to No (p1). However, since the event hasn't occurred yet, and it's still possible, the correct recommendation according to the user's personalization is p4. Therefore, the answer is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The evaluation of the Perplexity AI response reveals several critical issues that need addressing:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Karoline Leavitt saying \"Drone\" during a White House press briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp. According to the system prompt instructions, if the event is in the future, the response should default to p4. However, the response becomes convoluted with unnecessary reasoning about the market's resolution conditions and the user's personalization rules, leading to confusion about whether to recommend p1, p2, p3, or p4.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response's reasoning is overly verbose and repetitive, discussing the conflict between the market's resolution conditions and the user's personalization rules multiple times without reaching a clear, concise conclusion. This verbosity detracts from the clarity and directness expected in the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly identifies that no information is available about a briefing scheduled after March 25, 2025. However, it fails to straightforwardly apply the rule to return p4 for future events, as stipulated in the system prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not contain factual errors per se but is biased towards over-explaining the conflict between different sets of instructions (market's resolution conditions vs. user's personalization rules) instead of focusing on the clear directive to return p4 for future events.\n\nGiven these observations, the response needs improvement to align with the system prompt's requirements for clarity, conciseness, and adherence to specified rules for future events. The response should directly state that since the event is in the future, the recommendation is p4, without delving into unnecessary details about potential conflicts in resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response is overly verbose and fails to straightforwardly apply the rule to return p4 for future events, as required.
