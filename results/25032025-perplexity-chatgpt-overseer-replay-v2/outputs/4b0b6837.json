The user is asking about resolving a UMA optimistic oracle request for the CBB game between California Baptist and Grand Canyon on March 14, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Grand Canyon wins, it's p1; California Baptist, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so March 14 is in the past. Next, verify the outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, sources [2] and [7] both mention the WAC semifinal game on March 14 where GCU (Grand Canyon) defeated California Baptist 75-66. The box score in [4] from February 8 is a different game (women's basketball), so not relevant here. The highlights in [1] are from February 22, which is a regular-season game, but the March 14 game is the one in question. \n\nThe prediction in [6] had GCU winning 75-70, but the actual result from [2] and [7] is 75-66. Since the game occurred and GCU won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirm the game was played and GCU won, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between California Baptist and Grand Canyon scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET concluded with **Grand Canyon winning 75-66** in the WAC Tournament semifinal[2][7]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by detailed box scores and post-game reports confirming the completion of the event[2][7]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided:\n- **Grand Canyon's victory** directly triggers the **p1** outcome.  \n- No postponement or cancellation occurred, eliminating p3 considerations.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (CBB game between California Baptist and Grand Canyon on March 14, 2025) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It verifies the outcome of the game using reliable sources, which state that Grand Canyon won the game. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Grand Canyon win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and verifies the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly disregards irrelevant games and focuses on the specific event in question. The response also correctly ignores the possibilities of postponement or cancellation since there is no evidence suggesting such occurrences.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses verified sources to confirm the outcome of the game. It aligns the recommendation (p1) with the facts verified from the sources and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user and system prompts, focusing solely on verified facts and the specific event in question.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it accurately resolves the query based on the event's outcome and adheres strictly to the guidelines provided in the system prompt. The recommendation of p1 is justified and supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
