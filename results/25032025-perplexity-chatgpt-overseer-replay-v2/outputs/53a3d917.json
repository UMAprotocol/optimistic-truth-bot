The user wants to know whether the UEFA Nations League quarter-final between Italy and Germany should resolve to p1 (Germany), p2 (Italy), or p3 (50-50) based on the provided ancillary data. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The second leg of the quarter-final was scheduled for March 23, 2025, according to the search results. The first leg was on March 20, 2025, where Germany won 2-1 in Milan. The second leg took place on March 23, 2025, in Dortmund. \n\nLooking at the second leg result from source [6], Germany drew 3-3 with Italy but won 5-4 on aggregate. The article states that Germany advanced to the finals, which means they progressed to the next round. The ancillary data specifies that if Germany advances, the resolution is p1, and if Italy advances, it's p2. Since the aggregate score after both legs was in Germany's favor, they are the ones moving forward. \n\nI also need to confirm that the match wasn't postponed beyond December 31, 2025. The second leg was played on March 23, 2025, well before the deadline, so there's no need for a p3 resolution. All sources, especially [6] and [7], confirm the dates and outcomes. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Germany) as they advanced based on the aggregate score.\n</think>\n\nGermany advanced to the next round of the 2024/25 UEFA Nations League after defeating Italy 5-4 on aggregate in their quarter-final tie. The first leg on March 20, 2025, ended 2-1 to Germany in Milan[11][14], and the second leg on March 23, 2025, finished 3-3 in Dortmund, with Germany progressing via the aggregate score[6]. The match was completed before the December 31, 2025 deadline, and the outcome was confirmed through official UEFA match reports[6][7][12].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the instruction to resolve based on the event's outcome as verified through reliable sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the sequence of events, checking the dates of the matches against the current date to ensure they have occurred. It confirms that Germany won on aggregate, which matches the resolution condition for Germany advancing (p1).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its specific outcomes, aligning the recommendation (p1) with the fact that Germany advanced. The response also correctly disregards the possibility of a p3 resolution since the match was not postponed beyond the specified date.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response uses the specified sources effectively and bases its recommendation on the verified outcomes of the matches.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742905067 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:17:47 UTC"
