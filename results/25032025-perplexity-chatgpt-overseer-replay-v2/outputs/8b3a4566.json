The ancillary data specifies that if the Hornets win, it's p2; Clippers win, p1; postponed remains open; canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game took place on March 16, 2025. Sources [1], [3], [5], and [6] all confirm the Clippers won 123-88. The final scores from the box score in [3] show each quarter's points, and the recap in [1] states the Clippers dominated. \n\nNext, check for any postponement or cancellation. All sources refer to the game happening on the scheduled date. No mentions of delays or cancellations. The ancillary data says if postponed, the market stays open, but since the game was played, that's not an issue. \n\nNow, verify the winner. Multiple sources, including the AP recap in [1] and the LA Times article [5], confirm the Clippers' victory. The score is 123-88, a clear win. \n\nSince the game occurred and the Clippers won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information in the sources. All evidence points to a Clippers win without any disputes. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Charlotte Hornets and Los Angeles Clippers on March 16, 2025, occurred as scheduled at 7:00 PM ET. The Clippers defeated the Hornets **123-88**, with James Harden leading the team with 31 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists[1][3][5]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by detailed quarter-by-quarter scoring[3] and postgame recaps confirming the outcome[1][6]. \n\nPer the resolution conditions, since the Clippers won decisively, the market resolves to **p1**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
