The current date is March 25, 2025, which is two days after the game was played on March 23. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The search results mention the game took place on March 23, 2025. Results like [3], [5], [7], [9], and [11] all confirm that Duke won the game 89-66. For example, result [3] states, \"No. 1-seed Duke ended No. 9-seed Baylor's season with a relatively comfortable 89-66 Round of 32 win.\" Similarly, result [5] from Baylor's official site says, \"No. 9 MBB Falls to No. 1 Duke in the Round of 32\" with the final score 89-66. \n\nNext, I need to ensure the event wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources reference the game happening as scheduled on March 23, so no issues there. The resolution conditions specify that if Duke wins, it's p1. Since multiple credible sources confirm Duke's victory, the correct resolution is p1. There's no mention of the game being canceled or requiring a 50-50 split. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nDuke defeated Baylor 89-66 in their March 23, 2025 NCAA Tournament second-round matchup, as confirmed by multiple sources including official game recaps, box scores, and news reports[3][5][7][9][11]. The game occurred on schedule with no postponement or cancellation. According to the resolution conditions, a Duke win corresponds to **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924010 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:33:30 UTC"
