The ancillary data specifies that if Marquette wins, the market resolves to Marquette (p2), if Xavier wins, it's Xavier (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past relative to the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 13, so it's already happened. That means I need to determine the actual outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] mentions Xavier's loss to Marquette in the BIG EAST Tournament Quarterfinal with a score of 89-87. Source [3] and [5] both state that Marquette rallied past Xavier 89-87. Specifically, [3] says Kam Jones scored 28 points for Marquette, and [5] notes that Marquette took the lead for good with 1:16 left. \n\nAdditionally, source [6] mentions the split in regular-season games but the tournament game result is clearly in favor of Marquette. The key here is verifying the date and the outcome. All relevant sources from March 13 indicate Marquette's victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution should be based on the actual result. \n\nSince Marquette won, the market should resolve to p2. I need to ensure that the event in question is the specific game on March 13, which it is, and that the sources are reliable. All the CBS Sports, Spectrum News, and Xavier's own athletics site confirm the result. No conflicting information is present. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Marquette vs. Xavier men's basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 2:30 PM ET concluded with **Marquette defeating Xavier 89-87** in the Big East Tournament quarterfinals[1][3][5]. Key details:  \n\n- Marquette overcame a 14-point second-half deficit, taking the lead for good at 81-80 with 1:16 remaining on Kam Jones' layup[3][5].  \n- Xavier's Ryan Conwell scored a career-high 38 points, including a buzzer-beating three-pointer, but the Musketeers fell short despite leading for nearly 31 minutes of gameplay[1][5].  \n- The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required[1][3][5].  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **Marquette** (p2).  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
