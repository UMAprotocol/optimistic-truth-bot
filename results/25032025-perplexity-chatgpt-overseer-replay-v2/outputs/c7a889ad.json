The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1; Hurricanes, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 22, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles ([1], [2], [3], [4], [7]) report that the Kings won 7-2. For example, source [1] states the Kings delivered a 7-2 victory, and source [7] confirms the score with details about the game. The other sources also consistently mention the Kings' win, ending the Hurricanes' eight-game streak. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources agree the game happened as scheduled. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 (Kings). The prediction in source [5] had the Hurricanes favored, but the actual result was a Kings victory. So the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 7-2 in their NHL game on March 22, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][3][7]. The Kings secured a decisive victory, ending the Hurricanes' eight-game winning streak. All reports indicate the game occurred as scheduled without postponement or cancellation. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided:\n- **p1 (Kings)** is the correct outcome since Los Angeles won decisively.  \n- No evidence suggests the game was postponed or canceled, ruling out **p3**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies that there is no evidence of the game being postponed or canceled, which supports the resolution to p1.\n\nThe recommendation of p1 is based on verified facts from reliable sources, and there is no indication of any missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, ensuring that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742932751 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:59:11 UTC",
