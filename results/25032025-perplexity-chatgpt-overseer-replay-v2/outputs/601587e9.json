        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether any Democratic senators voted for the passage of H.R. 1968 by March 14, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if at least one Democratic senator votes for the bill's passage in the initial roll call vote. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14, so the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the sources, several mention the Senate vote on H.R. 1968. Source [2] from ABC News states that the Senate passed the bill with a 54-46 vote, noting that Sen. Angus King (Independent) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (Democrat) voted in favor. All other Democrats voted against except these two. Source [4] from Axios confirms that ten Senate Democrats joined Republicans in the procedural vote, but in the final passage, only Shaheen and King (who caucuses with Democrats) voted yes. Source [6] is Senator Fetterman's statement, where he voted for cloture but against the final bill. Source [7] from Politico also mentions Shaheen and King voting yes, with Rand Paul as the only Republican against.\n\nThe key point is the final passage vote. The resolution conditions specify the initial roll call vote for passage. The final vote was 54-46. According to the sources, Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Angus King (I-ME, caucusing with Democrats) voted yes. Since King is considered a Democrat for this resolution, his vote counts. Therefore, at least one Democratic senator (Shaheen) and an independent caucusing with Democrats (King) voted yes. \n\nThus, the answer should be \"Yes\" (p2) because the condition of having 1 or more Democratic senators voting for passage is met.\n</think>\n\nThe Senate passed H.R. 1968, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, on March 14, 2025, with a final roll call vote of 54-46[2][7]. The resolution conditions specify that **Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH)** and **Sen. Angus King (I-ME)**, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, both voted \"yes\" on final passage[2][4][7]. Since Sen. King is considered part of the Democratic caucus per the resolution rules, this satisfies the requirement of at least one Democratic senator supporting the bill.  \n\nWhile 10 Democrats initially supported the procedural cloture vote[4][6], only Shaheen and King voted for final passage. The resolution explicitly depends on the **initial roll call vote for passage**, not procedural votes[ancillary_data].  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929206 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:00:06 UTC",
