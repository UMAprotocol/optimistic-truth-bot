The resolution conditions specify that the answer is \"Yes\" if the order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or the press pool by 12 PM ET the next day. Otherwise, it's \"No\". \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any executive orders signed on March 24. Let me go through each source. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of the executive orders mentioned are from January 20, February, and March 20. For example, source [5] and [14] mention an executive order signed on March 20 to dismantle the Education Department. Source [6] from March 24 talks about the Trump administration asking the Supreme Court to halt a judge's order, but that's not an executive order. Source [7] is about an executive order on March 20 regarding federal workforce suitability. Source [9] has entries up to March 19, and source [13] lists orders up to March 20. \n\nThere's no mention of an executive order on March 24 in any of the provided sources. The latest orders are from March 20. The user's current date is March 25, 2025, so the deadline for publication would have been March 25 at 12 PM ET. Since none of the sources indicate an executive order on March 24, the answer should be \"No\". \n\nI also need to ensure that the federal register and White House pages are checked, but the provided sources don't show any such publication for March 24. Therefore, the resolution is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results, there is no evidence that Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 24, 2025. The most recent executive orders mentioned in the sources were signed on **March 20, 2025**, including:\n\n- An order directing the closure of the Department of Education[5][14][16][17].\n- An order on federal workforce suitability[7].\n- Tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China[1].\n\nThe March 24, 2025, search results focus on litigation related to layoffs[6], regulatory actions[19], and other administrative updates, but no new executive orders. The White House presidential actions page and Federal Register would need to list an order published by March 25, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET for resolution as \"Yes,\" but no such publication is indicated in the provided sources.\n\n**recommendation: p1**",

It adheres to the user prompt's instructions by focusing on the specific date mentioned and checking the relevant sources for any executive orders.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the absence of any executive order on the specified date and correctly concludes that the market should resolve as \"No\" (p1). The reasoning is based on the absence of evidence in the specified sources up to the deadline provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that no executive order was published by the deadline of March 25, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions. The recommendation of p1 is consistent with the findings and the ancillary data provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The response does not mention any irrelevant information and stays focused on the event in question. It also correctly uses the sources specified in the user prompt for verification.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934018 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:20:18 UTC",
