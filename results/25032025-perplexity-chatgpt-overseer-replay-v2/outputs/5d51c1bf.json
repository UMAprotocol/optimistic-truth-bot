        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Aaron Rodgers will leave the Jets based on the ancillary data provided. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for unknown. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the 2025-26 NFL season starts on September 4, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check if Rodgers has already been cut, traded, signed elsewhere, or retired. The search results mention that the Jets announced on February 13, 2025, that they are moving on from Rodgers [2][3][5]. They informed him of their decision, which means he's being released. According to the ancillary data, if he's cut before the season starts, the answer is Yes (p2). \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles confirm the Jets have parted ways with him. For example, source [2] states the Jets announced they're moving on, and source [5] mentions the official statement from the team. Additionally, source [6] discusses the salary cap implications of his release, indicating the Jets are handling his contract termination. \n\nRodgers hasn't retired yet, as source [10] reports he told the Jets he intends to keep playing. There's also speculation about him joining another team, like the Rams or Steelers [9][14], but regardless of where he goes, the key point is the Jets have already decided to release him. \n\nSince being cut is one of the conditions for resolving to Yes, and the Jets have officially announced their decision, the answer should be p2. Even if he hasn't signed with a new team yet, the act of being cut by the Jets before the season starts meets the resolution criteria. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Jets officially announced on February 13, 2025, that they are moving on from Aaron Rodgers, informing the quarterback of their decision to part ways[2][3][5]. This fulfills the ancillary data condition that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Rodgers is cut by the Jets before the 2025-26 NFL season begins. While Rodgers has expressed interest in continuing his career[10][13], his release from the Jets alone satisfies the resolution criteria, regardless of whether he retires or signs with another team. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on the factual event of Aaron Rodgers being cut by the Jets before the start of the 2025-26 NFL season, which is a future event relative to the current timestamp. The response correctly identifies that this event meets the conditions for a \"Yes\" resolution (p2) as outlined in the ancillary data.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. It correctly identifies the key event (Rodgers being cut by the Jets) and verifies this through multiple sources, which is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of the resolution. The response also correctly disregards any need to confirm whether Rodgers signs with another team or retires, as his release by the Jets alone satisfies the resolution criteria for a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\nThe verification of the event is well-handled, with the response citing specific sources that confirm the Jets' decision to part ways with Rodgers. This aligns well with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt and does not introduce irrelevant information or speculation beyond what is necessary to resolve the query.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924117 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:35:17 UTC"
