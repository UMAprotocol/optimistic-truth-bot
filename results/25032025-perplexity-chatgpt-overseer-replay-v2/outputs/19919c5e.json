The ancillary data specifies that if the Capitals win, it's p1; Flyers win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 20, so the game should have happened. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, result [1] mentions the Capitals won 3-2, and [2] also states the Capitals clinched a playoff spot with this win. \n\nNext, verifying the score. All relevant sources ([1], [2], [4], [6], [8], [12]) consistently report the Capitals won 3-2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: Capitals win is p1. All evidence points to Washington winning, so the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Capitals defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 3-2 in their NHL game on March 20, 2025, at Capital One Arena. Alex Ovechkin scored his 888th career goal during the first period, contributing to Washington's lead[1][2][4][6][8]. The Capitals built a 3-0 advantage through goals from Brandon Duhaime and Andrew Mangiapane before the Flyers mounted a third-period comeback with tallies from Ryan Poehling and Sean Couturier, but fell short[1][4][12].  \n\nWith this victory, Washington clinched a playoff berth and became the first team to reach 100 points in the 2024-25 NHL season[2][6]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no evidence suggests irregularities in its completion[1][2][4][6][12].  \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

It confirms the game's completion and the absence of any irregularities that might affect the resolution, such as postponement or cancellation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation (p1) with the ancillary data's conditions. The Capitals' victory is consistently reported across various sources, and there is no evidence of the game being postponed or canceled.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
