The ancillary data specifies that if the Knicks win, it's p1; Wizards win, p2; postponed or canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game recap from ESPN [1] and other sources [6][9][10][13][14][15][16], all dated March 22, 2025. The detailed recap in [1] clearly states the Knicks won 122-103. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nNext, I should verify the final score. Multiple sources, including the ESPN recap [1][16], highlight the Knicks' victory with Karl-Anthony Towns scoring 31 points. The box score in [16] confirms the final score as Knicks 122, Wizards 103. \n\nSince the game was played on the scheduled date and the Knicks won, the resolution should be p1. No sources indicate any issues with the game being postponed or canceled. All evidence points to a completed game with a clear outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Washington Wizards and New York Knicks on March 22, 2025, was played as scheduled, with the **New York Knicks defeating the Washington Wizards 122-103**[1][6][16]. Karl-Anthony Towns led the Knicks with 31 points and 11 rebounds, while Mikal Bridges added 27 points[1][16]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required.  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- The Knicks built an 82-51 third-quarter lead before surviving a late Wizards rally[1][6].  \n- Washington\u2019s Jordan Poole scored 25 points but couldn\u2019t overcome New York\u2019s balanced offense[1][16].  \n- The game concluded without disruptions, and all available evidence confirms the final score[1][6][9][10][13][14][15][16].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, which is that the Knicks won the game. The response does not predict or assume but relies on factual recaps from reliable sources like ESPN.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by first verifying the occurrence of the game, then confirming the outcome, and finally aligning the resolution with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. It thoroughly checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and finds none, which supports the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event using multiple sources and confirms that the Knicks won with a specific score. It aligns the recommendation (p1) with the ancillary data where p1 corresponds to a Knicks win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is based on verified sources and strictly adheres to the facts without adding unnecessary details or assumptions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
