The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Michigan vs. Maryland college basketball game that was scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET.

The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game's outcome. \n\nSearch result [8] from mgoblue.com details that Michigan won 81-80 with a last-second layup by Tre Donaldson. Similarly, [10] and [13] confirm this result, mentioning the same score and the game-winning play. The University of Maryland's own site [11] also reports the loss, with a final score of 81-80 in favor of Michigan. \n\nAll these sources are reliable\u2014official team websites and reputable sports news outlets. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The detailed accounts of the game's ending, including specific player stats and the sequence of events, leave no doubt that the game was played as scheduled and concluded with Michigan's victory. \n\nSince the game happened and Michigan won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. There's no conflicting information in the search results; all point to Michigan's win. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Michigan vs. Maryland college basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET concluded with a **Michigan victory** (81-80) after a last-second layup by Tre Donaldson[8][10][13]. Multiple sources, including official team reports and sports news outlets, confirm the outcome[8][10][11][13]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game was required. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided (p2 for a Michigan win), the market should resolve to **p2**.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the Michigan vs. Maryland college basketball game appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game in question occurred on March 15, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The AI then verifies the outcome of the game using multiple reliable sources, including official team websites and sports news outlets, which all confirm Michigan's victory. This adherence to verifying past events through reliable sources aligns with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first establishing the date of the event and its relevance (past event), then confirming the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt (p2 for a Michigan win) and concludes with a recommendation that aligns with these conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI's verification process involves checking multiple sources that confirm the game's outcome, ensuring that the event was neither postponed nor canceled. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 (Michigan win) is directly based on this verified outcome, which is in full alignment with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not exhibit any deviation from the facts or the conditions set in the user prompt. All sources used for verification are relevant and appropriate, and there is no missing information that could affect the resolution's accuracy.\n\nGiven this analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests. It is accurate, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Michigan vs. Maryland game using reliable sources, logically applies the resolution conditions, and aligns perfectly with the user prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured and thorough, effectively using multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and adhering closely to the system prompt requirements.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906094 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:34:54 UTC"
