The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Golden State Warriors vs. Atlanta Hawks game on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Hawks win, it's p1; if the Warriors win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query mentions March 22 at 7:00 PM ET. The current date provided is March 25, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Now, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the sources, result [3] is a YouTube video titled \"WARRIORS at HAWKS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | March 22, 2025\" which states the Hawks defeated the Warriors 124-115. Similarly, result [5] from Sports Illustrated confirms the Hawks' victory with a final score of 124-115. Other sources like [4], [6], [7], and [8] also mention the Hawks winning. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are clear: Hawks win is p1. Since multiple reliable sources confirm the Hawks' victory, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks defeated the Golden State Warriors 124-115 in their March 22, 2025 matchup at State Farm Arena[3][5][7]. Multiple sources confirm the Hawks secured a decisive victory through strong offensive performances from Trae Young (25 points, 10 assists), Onyeka Okongwu (22 points, 12 rebounds), and Georges Niang (23 points off the bench)[3][5][7]. The Warriors, playing without Stephen Curry[5], were led by Jimmy Butler III's 25 points but couldn't overcome Atlanta's 57% field goal shooting and 42% three-point accuracy[5].\n\nThis outcome occurred on the scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any verified reports[3][5][7]. Per the resolution conditions defined in the ancillary data, the market should resolve to **p1** (Hawks win).\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response effectively adheres to the instructions provided in the system prompt and accurately resolves the query based on the event's outcome. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NBA game between the Warriors and Hawks on March 22, 2025) has already occurred by the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is that the Hawks won against the Warriors with a score of 124-115. This is in line with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response thoroughly checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled and confirms that it took place as scheduled. It then aligns the outcome with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Hawks win corresponds to p1. The reasoning is logical, complete, and follows the resolution conditions specified.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, including a YouTube video and articles from Sports Illustrated, which are considered reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Hawks win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the ancillary data's conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has correctly interpreted and applied the user prompt and system instructions without deviating from the specified conditions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation is based on concrete evidence and established facts, and it correctly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the verified outcome of the event, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and aligns perfectly with the ancillary data conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the event's outcome and makes a well-supported recommendation.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
