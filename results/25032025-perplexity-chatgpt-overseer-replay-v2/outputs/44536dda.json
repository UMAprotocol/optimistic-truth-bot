The ancillary data specifies that if the Hurricanes win, it's p1; if the Red Wings win, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on March 14. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] from ESPN on March 14, 2025, clearly states the Hurricanes won 4-2. Another source [5] from NHL.com confirms the same score, mentioning it's their sixth straight win. There's also a YouTube video [7] with highlights titled \"Canes' 4-2 win over Detroit Red Wings on March 14, 2025.\" \n\nOther results like [3] and [8] reference the same game date and outcome. The box scores and recaps all align, showing Carolina's victory. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. \n\nSince the game occurred, and all credible sources confirm the Hurricanes won, the resolution should be p1. The ancillary data maps p1 to Hurricanes, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Red Wings faced the Carolina Hurricanes on March 14, 2025, at Lenovo Center. According to multiple verified sources, the **Carolina Hurricanes won the game 4-2**[1][5][7]. Key details from the matchup include:\n\n- **Carolina\u2019s scoring**: Goals from Jack Roslovic, Taylor Hall, Jalen Chatfield, and Eric Robinson, with Frederik Andersen making 24 saves[1][5].\n- **Detroit\u2019s performance**: Alex DeBrincat and Michael Rasmussen scored, but the Red Wings lost their seventh game in eight outings[1][5].\n\nThe game proceeded as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Since the Hurricanes secured a decisive victory, the market resolves to **p1 (Hurricanes)**. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between Detroit Red Wings and Carolina Hurricanes on March 14, 2025) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It uses multiple reliable sources (ESPN, NHL.com, YouTube) to verify the outcome of the game, which is that the Carolina Hurricanes won 4-2. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Hurricanes win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and finds none, thus confirming the game was played as scheduled. The response then correctly maps the verified outcome to the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, leading to a recommendation of p1.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation of p1 for a Hurricanes win is directly aligned with the ancillary data's specifications.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the facts and the user prompt's instructions without adding unnecessary details or assumptions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the provided instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923851 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:30:51 UTC"
