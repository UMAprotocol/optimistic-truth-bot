        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ashton Hall will post another facial ice bath video by Friday, March 28, 2025. The resolution depends on whether he posts such a video between March 24 and March 28. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The period in question is from March 24 to March 28. So we're already within that window. \n\nLooking at the search results, Ashton Hall's recent videos (as of March 25) include his morning routine with multiple ice water dunks. The sources mention that he has been consistently posting variations of his morning routine, each featuring the ice dunk. For example, source [12] from March 25 states that he continues to post these routines and even addressed others copying his content. Source [9] from March 23 also notes that his videos include the ice water face dunks as a signature part of his routine.\n\nAdditionally, source [12] mentions that on March 24, he posted a video addressing other creators, which might include his routine. However, the exact content of that video isn't specified. But given his history, it's likely he included the ice bath. \n\nSince the market resolution allows for credible reporting if his official pages aren't accessible, sources like [12] and [9] indicate that his routine is a regular feature. There's no mention of him stopping this practice. Therefore, the probability leans towards \"Yes\" because he's been consistently posting such content, and there's no evidence he's stopped. \n\nHowever, we need to confirm if he has already posted one within the specified dates. The query period started on March 24. The latest sources (up to March 25) don't explicitly mention a new post within March 24-28, but his established pattern suggests he would continue. Given the lack of contradictory information and his consistent behavior, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nAshton Hall's morning routine videos, which prominently feature face-dunking in ice water, have become a signature element of his content. Multiple sources confirm that Hall has consistently included this practice in his videos, with his March 2025 viral routine sparking widespread discussion and memes[1][2][9]. \n\n**Key points for resolution:**\n- Hall's ice-water facial dunks are a recurring feature in his content, described as a \"now-signature\" part of his routine[9][13].\n- As of March 25, 2025, he continues to post variations of his morning rituals, all including the ice dunk[12][13].\n- The viral video referenced in the query was originally posted in February 2025 but gained renewed attention through reposts in March[1][5], demonstrating Hall's ongoing engagement with this content type.\n\nGiven Hall's pattern of frequently posting ice bath content and the absence of any reports indicating he has stopped this practice, the most probable outcome is that he will post another facial ice bath video by March 28, 2025, as per his established content strategy. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Ashton Hall will post another facial ice bath video by Friday, March 28, 2025, needs to be evaluated for factual accuracy, logical reasoning, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the current date as March 25, 2025, and acknowledges that the period in question (March 24 to March 28, 2025) is currently ongoing. The response uses sources that suggest Ashton Hall has a pattern of posting videos featuring ice water face dunks. However, the response fails to provide concrete evidence that such a video was posted specifically between March 24 and March 25, 2025. The reliance on past patterns without current, specific evidence does not fully adhere to the instruction to base the resolution on \"verified facts\" and \"concrete evidence.\"\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The reasoning provided is based on the assumption that past behavior will continue into the specified period without direct evidence from those specific dates. While it is logical to infer that a consistent pattern might continue, the system prompt requires verification of the event within the specified timeframe, which is not adequately addressed.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not verify that the specific event (posting of a new ice bath video within the specified dates) has occurred. It instead infers likelihood based on past behavior. This does not align with the requirement for concrete verification of events that have already occurred.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response is biased towards the assumption that regular behavior continues without interruption. It lacks direct evidence from the specified period (March 24-28, 2025) and does not confirm whether a new relevant video was actually posted in that timeframe.\n\nGiven these points, the response does not meet the required standards of accuracy and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision should be to retry with a specific focus on obtaining and verifying information strictly from the period of March 24 to March 28, 2025.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response lacks concrete evidence for the specific timeframe required by the prompt and relies on assumptions based on past behavior.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response needs to strictly verify the occurrence of the event within the specified dates and should not infer outcomes based on patterns or past events outside the relevant period.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please provide evidence of a video posted by Ashton Hall featuring a facial ice bath specifically between March 24 and March 28, 2025. Ensure the verification is based on direct observation of content posted within these dates.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Ashton Hall will post another facial ice bath video between March 24 and March 28, 2025. The resolution depends on verifying such a post within that timeframe. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The period in question is from March 24 to March 28, so we're right in the middle of that window. \n\nLooking at the search results provided, most of them are from March 22 to March 25. The latest one is from March 25, 2025 (source [8]), which details his morning routine but doesn't mention a new video posted within the specified dates. The other sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11) all discuss his existing viral video from February and early March, which includes the ice baths. However, none of these sources mention a new video posted between March 24 and 28. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution should be based on Ashton's official social media or credible reports. The search results don't include any new posts from Ashton within the target dates. All references to his ice baths are from before March 24. \n\nSince there's no evidence of a new post within the required timeframe, and the current date is March 25, the market should resolve to \"No\" unless a new post appears by March 28. However, based on the provided information up to March 25, there's no confirmation of such a post. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1 (No) because there's no verified evidence of a new video within the specified dates.\n</think>\n\nAshton Hall's viral morning routine, which includes multiple facial ice baths, was documented in a video originally posted in February 2025 and reposted across platforms in subsequent weeks. The search results provided cover dates up to March 25, 2025, and none indicate that Hall posted a **new** facial ice bath video between March 24 and March 28, 2025. All references to his ice-dunking ritual relate to the original February video or subsequent reposts/commentary about it[1][4][7][8][10].\n\nKey points:\n- The original video showing ice baths was posted in February 2025[1][4][7]\n- Multiple March 2025 articles (March 22-25) discuss this existing video but don't mention new posts[2][3][6][9][11]\n- The most recent source (March 25) still references the original routine without indicating new content[8]\n\nSince no evidence exists in the provided sources of a new ice bath video posted during the March 24-28 window, and the current date is March 25, 2025 (within the resolution period), this market cannot confirm a qualifying post at this time. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the current date as March 25, 2025, and acknowledges that the event in question (posting of a new ice bath video by Ashton Hall) falls within the specified date range of March 24 to March 28, 2025. The response adheres to the instruction to verify the occurrence of the event within these dates and does not infer outcomes based on past events or patterns outside the relevant period.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically analyzes the available sources, noting that none of them mention a new video posted between March 24 and March 28. It correctly concludes that based on the evidence available up to March 25, there is no confirmation of a new post. This reasoning is sound and aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively uses the sources to verify that no new video has been posted within the required timeframe. The recommendation of p1 (No) is aligned with the facts presented and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not rely on unreliable sources or speculative information. It strictly adheres to the evidence available from the specified resolution sources.\n\nBased on this analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory. It accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, adheres to the instructions, and provides a well-justified recommendation based on the evidence. There is no missing information that could alter the outcome of the analysis, and the response does not exhibit any bias or errors.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the non-occurrence of the event within the specified dates using the appropriate sources, adheres to the instructions, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the available sources to confirm that no new video was posted within the required timeframe and makes a recommendation based on this verified information.

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907572 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:59:32 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease provide evidence of a video posted by Ashton Hall featuring a facial ice bath specifically between March 24 and March 28, 2025. Ensure the verification is based on direct observation of content posted within these dates."
