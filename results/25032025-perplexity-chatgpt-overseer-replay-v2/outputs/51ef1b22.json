The ancillary data specifies that if the Blues win, it's p1; if the Canadiens win, p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 26, 2025, which is after the game's scheduled date. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [8], [9]) report that the St. Louis Blues defeated the Montreal Canadiens 6-1 on March 25. For example, source [1] states, \"the St. Louis Blues beat the Montreal Canadiens 6-1 on Tuesday night to extend their active NHL-best winning streak to seven games.\" Similarly, source [9] from ESPN confirms the same score and outcome. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports indicate the game took place as scheduled with a clear result. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since the Blues won, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI should also check if there are any conflicting reports, but all sources align on the Blues' victory. No sources suggest a different outcome or any issues with the game's completion. Thus, the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe St. Louis Blues defeated the Montreal Canadiens 6-1 in their NHL game on March 25, 2025, extending their winning streak to seven games[1][2][8][9]. Key contributors included Philip Broberg and Robert Thomas, who each recorded four points (1 goal, 3 assists)[1][9], while Jordan Binnington made 24 saves[9]. The Blues dominated the game, scoring three goals in the final two minutes of the first period and maintaining control throughout[8][9].  \n\nThis outcome occurred on the scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any verified reports[1][2][8][9].  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015510 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 18:58:30 UTC"
