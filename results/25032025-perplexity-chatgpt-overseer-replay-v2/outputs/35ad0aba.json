The ancillary data specifies that if the Rangers win, it's p2 (\"Rangers\"), and if the Wild win, it's p1 (\"Wild\"). The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the game's outcome. Looking at the sources provided, multiple articles (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8) report that Braden Schneider scored in overtime, giving the Rangers a 3-2 victory over the Wild. The game took place on March 13, as scheduled, and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nSince the Rangers won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. All sources agree on the result, so there's no ambiguity. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so the 50-50 resolution doesn't apply. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the New York Rangers and Minnesota Wild on March 13, 2025, concluded with the Rangers winning 3-2 in overtime. Braden Schneider scored the decisive goal at 1:51 of the extra period, ending the Rangers' four-game losing streak[1][2][3][5][6][8]. The game was played as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, and the outcome is verified across multiple sources. \n\n**Resolution:** The market resolves to \"Rangers\" (p2) based on their victory. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the NHL game between the New York Rangers and Minnesota Wild took place on March 13, 2025, and that the Rangers won the game. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts. The game's date and outcome are correctly matched with the user prompt's conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified event outcome. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (p2 for a Rangers win) and concludes with the appropriate recommendation (p2). The reasoning is clear, and the response is complete as it covers all potential outcomes (win, loss, postponement, cancellation) and confirms the actual outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The alignment between the verified facts and the recommendation (p2) is precise and adheres to the ancillary data definitions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly focuses on the event specified in the user prompt without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
