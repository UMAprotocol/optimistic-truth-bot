The ancillary data specifies that if the Avalanche win, it's p2 (Avalanche), Senators win p1 (Senators), postponed remains open, canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Checking the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) report the game took place on March 20, 2025. All sources agree the Avalanche won 5-1. For example, source [1] states the final score was 5-1 in favor of Colorado, and source [8] mentions Brock Nelson scoring twice for the Avalanche. The Senators' only goal was by Dylan Cozens, as per source [5]. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All reports indicate the game was completed as scheduled. Therefore, the Avalanche's victory meets the condition for resolving to p2. I need to ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources consistently report the Avalanche's win. Thus, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche defeated the Ottawa Senators 5-1 in their NHL game on March 20, 2025[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Multiple sources confirm the Avalanche dominated with a four-goal first period, including two goals from trade-deadline acquisition Brock Nelson[1][4][6][8]. Ottawa's only goal came from Dylan Cozens during a third-period power play[5][8]. The game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The evaluation of the Perplexity AI oracle response reveals that it has adhered well to the instructions provided in the system prompt and has accurately resolved the query based on the event's outcome. Here is a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between Colorado Avalanche and Ottawa Senators on March 20, 2025) has already occurred by the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is that the Avalanche won 5-1. This outcome aligns with the conditions set in the user prompt for resolution to p2 if the Avalanche win.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event date and outcome, then checking for any indications of postponement or cancellation, and finally aligning the outcome with the specified resolution conditions. The reasoning is thorough and well-structured, ensuring that all necessary checks (game completion, no postponement or cancellation) are accounted for before arriving at a recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring reliability. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 is directly based on the verified outcome that the Avalanche won, which is in perfect alignment with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt without introducing any external assumptions or irrelevant data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on the verified outcome of the event, adhering strictly to the user prompt instructions and ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and logically aligned the resolution recommendation with the specified conditions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930135 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:15:35 UTC",
