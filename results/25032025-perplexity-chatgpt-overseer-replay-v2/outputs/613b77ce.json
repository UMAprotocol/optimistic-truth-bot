        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"God\" two or more times during his press conference with Ireland's Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 if it's uncertain. The event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to see if there's any mention of Trump using the word \"God\" during that specific event. Let's go through the sources one by one.\n\nLooking at source [1], it's a YouTube video of the event. The transcript snippet mentions Trump talking about Irish friends and St. Patrick's Day but doesn't include the word \"God\". \n\nSource [3] describes the event, mentioning Trump's comments on US-Ireland ties and the Riverdance performance. Again, no mention of \"God\" here.\n\nSource [5] discusses Trump stumbling over his script, referring to Saint Patrick as a \"patriot saint\" instead of \"patron saint\". The article quotes his speech but doesn't include \"God\".\n\nSource [6] is another video of the event. The transcript provided in the search results includes Trump welcoming the Irish PM and talking about St. Patrick's Cathedral as a monument to God. Wait, here's a mention: \"a monument not only to God but also to the patron Saint of Ireland\". That's one instance.\n\nSource [16] and [17] provide more detailed transcripts. In [17], Trump's speech includes: \"a monument not only to God but also to the patron Saint of Ireland\". That's the same instance as in [6]. \n\nLooking further into [17], Trump also says, \"the Bible says that blessed is the nation whose God is the lord\". That's a second mention of \"God\". \n\nSo, in the transcript from the St. Patrick's Day Reception, Trump refers to God twice. Once when talking about the cathedral and another when quoting the Bible. Both instances are during the event specified in the updates. \n\nTherefore, the answer should resolve to Yes (p2) because there are two clear mentions of \"God\" in the relevant event.\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump said the word \"God\" at least twice during the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Reception with Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach on March 12, 2025. In his remarks, he described St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral as \"a monument not only to **God**\" and later quoted the Bible: \"blessed is the nation whose **God** is the Lord\" [6][17]. Both instances occurred during the event specified in the resolution conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment with the facts of the event. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception with the Taoiseach of Ireland, scheduled for March 12, 2025. The AI checks multiple sources, including videos and transcripts, to verify whether Donald Trump mentioned the word \"God\" two or more times. The response adheres to the user prompt's requirement to count any usage of the term \"God,\" including in compound forms or pluralization/possessive cases.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is thorough, checking multiple sources and confirming the instances where the word \"God\" was mentioned. It identifies two specific instances from the transcripts where Trump used the word \"God,\" which aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI correctly verifies that the event took place as scheduled and that the term \"God\" was mentioned at least twice during the event. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Yes\" (p2) is based on concrete evidence from the event's transcripts and is aligned with the resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI effectively uses the provided sources to make an informed resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions. The logical reasoning is sound, and the recommendation aligns perfectly with the facts verified from the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the occurrence of the event and correctly identifies the instances of the term 'God' being used, aligning with the resolution conditions. The recommendation is based on concrete evidence and established facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and adheres closely to the instructions, with a clear and logical reasoning process. All sources are appropriately checked, and the resolution recommendation is well-supported by the facts.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934386 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:26:26 UTC",
