        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. First, I need to determine the current date and time, which is March 25, 2025, 12:40 PM UTC. The game in question was scheduled for March 24 at 7:00 PM ET. Since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, the game would have started at 23:00 UTC on March 24. The current time is about 13 hours and 40 minutes after the scheduled start, so the game should have already taken place.\n\nNext, I check the ancillary data and resolution conditions. The user provided that p1 is Wizards, p2 is Raptors, and p3 is 50-50 if canceled. The market resolves based on the game's outcome. The key here is to verify the result of the game that happened on March 24.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are two sources. The first mentions the Raptors winning 103-100 against the Wizards on March 24. The second source also confirms the Raptors' victory with the same score. Both sources are from reputable sports sites (Sportskeeda and Sportsnaut), which adds credibility.\n\nSince both sources agree on the outcome, and the game date is in the past, there's no indication of postponement or cancellation. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Raptors). No conflicting information is present, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Toronto Raptors and Washington Wizards scheduled for March 24, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET concluded with the **Raptors defeating the Wizards 103-100**[1][2]. Both Sportskeeda and Sportsnaut reported identical final scores confirming Toronto's victory. \n\nAccording to the resolution conditions, this outcome triggers **p2 resolution** (\"Raptors\") as defined in the ancillary data. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the available information.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

It then verifies the outcome of the NBA game between the Raptors and Wizards using reputable sources, which is in line with the instructions to use verified facts. The response adheres to the system prompt by not predicting future outcomes and focusing solely on the event that has already occurred.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the time of the event, checks for the outcome, and uses multiple sources to confirm the result of the game. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt (p1 for Wizards, p2 for Raptors, p3 for 50-50 if canceled) and concludes with a recommendation based on the verified outcome of the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through two independent sources, both confirming the Raptors' victory. This verification aligns with the ancillary data provided, leading to a recommendation of p2 (Raptors), which matches the outcome.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is based on concrete evidence and established facts, and it does not show any deviation from the provided instructions or ancillary data.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906421 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:40:21 UTC",
