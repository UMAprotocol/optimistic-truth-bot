The ancillary data specifies that if Auburn wins, it resolves to p1 (Auburn), if Ole Miss wins, p2 (Ole Miss), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already taken place. Checking the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [5], [8], [10], [13], [14], [15]) report that Auburn defeated Ole Miss 62-57 in the SEC Tournament quarterfinals on March 14. For example, source [1] states the final score as Auburn 62, Ole Miss 57. Source [5] mentions Johni Broome's key performance leading Auburn to victory. \n\nI also need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game occurring as scheduled, with detailed recaps and stats. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nSince the game was played and Auburn won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information exists in the search results. All sources consistently report Auburn's win, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nAuburn defeated Ole Miss 62-57 in the SEC Men's Basketball Tournament quarterfinals on March 14, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources detailing the game's outcome[1][2][4][5][8][10][13][15]. The game was played as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with Auburn maintaining a lead throughout the second half and securing the win through key plays by Johni Broome[5][8].

Confirming the game was not postponed or canceled, which aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\n2. Accurately applying the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where Auburn's win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks for the game's occurrence, outcome, and any potential issues like postponements or cancellations. The response then aligns the verified outcome with the specified resolution conditions (p1 for an Auburn win).\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are both thorough and accurate. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring reliability and reducing the risk of bias or error.\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response is complete, adheres strictly to the user prompt's requirements, and provides a clear and justified recommendation based on the verified facts.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event using multiple sources, aligns with the resolution conditions provided, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome and applies the ancillary data correctly for resolution.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929739 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:08:59 UTC"
