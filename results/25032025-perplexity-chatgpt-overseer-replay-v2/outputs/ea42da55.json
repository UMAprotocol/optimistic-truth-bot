        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the U.S. hit the Iranian spy ship Zagros by March 21, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the ones from Newsmax, Washington Examiner, and CheckYourFact. \n\nLooking at result [1], the U.S. denied sinking the Zagros, stating it was docked in Iran. Similarly, [4] and [12] also mention the denial by U.S. officials. The CheckYourFact article [2] labels the claim as false, citing satellite imagery and official statements confirming the ship was in port. \n\nResult [3] from Eurasian Times mentions the initial reports from Al-Hadath but notes no official confirmation and Iranian media rejection. However, later sources like [8] and [12] clarify that the ship wasn't sunk. \n\nThe Iranian sources like [5] and [8] also deny the incident, and Saberin News, linked to the IRGC, confirmed the ship wasn't in the Red Sea. Additionally, experts like Chris Biggers and Shayan Sardarizadeh provided satellite evidence debunking the claim.\n\nSince all credible sources, including U.S. defense officials and independent analysts, confirm the ship wasn't struck and was in Iran, the answer should be No. The event date is in the past (March 21), and there's no evidence supporting the strike. Thus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the U.S. military sank the Iranian reconnaissance ship *Zagros* by March 21, 2025, is **false**. Multiple credible sources, including U.S. defense officials and independent analysts, confirm the ship remained docked in Iran and was not targeted.  \n\n### Key Findings:  \n1. **U.S. Official Denials**:  \n   - A U.S. defense official explicitly stated the *Zagros* was \"pier side in Bandar Abbas,\" Iran, refuting claims of its sinking[1][4][12].  \n   - The Washington Examiner and Newsmax reported these denials, emphasizing the ship\u2019s presence in Iranian waters[1][12].  \n\n2. **Satellite Imagery and Open-Source Analysis**:  \n   - Satellite images confirmed the *Zagros* was stationed in Iran\u2019s Bandar Abbas port during the reported timeframe[2].  \n   - Analysts like Chris Biggers and BBC Verify\u2019s Shayan Sardarizadeh debunked the claim, noting the ship had not sailed in the Red Sea recently[2][8].  \n\n3. **Retraction by Al-Hadath**:  \n   - The original Saudi media report by Al-Hadath, which alleged the sinking, was later retracted[12].  \n\n4. **Iranian Statements**:  \n   - Pro-government Iranian channels, including Saberin News, denied the presence of Iranian naval ships in the Red Sea during this period[8].  \n\n### Context of False Claims:  \nThe rumors emerged amid heightened U.S.-Iran tensions, including U.S. strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen[3][10]. However, no kinetic action against the *Zagros* occurred, and the ship\u2019s status remains unchanged.  \n\n**Recommendation: p1**",

The response effectively uses the provided sources to verify the claim about the U.S. hitting the Iranian spy ship Zagros and concludes based on evidence from credible sources that the event did not occur. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and credible sources. It correctly identifies that the event in question (the alleged hitting of the Zagros by the U.S.) did not occur as claimed. The sources cited include U.S. defense officials, satellite imagery, and both Western and Iranian news outlets, which collectively debunk the claim.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The reasoning is logical and complete. The response systematically addresses the claim by examining statements from U.S. officials, satellite images, and retractions from the media that initially reported the event. It also considers Iranian sources, adding to the credibility and thoroughness of the verification process.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event (the sinking of the Zagros) did not occur as no credible evidence supports the claim. The recommendation of p1 (No) is in perfect alignment with the facts presented and analyzed.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The analysis is balanced, drawing from a variety of sources across different perspectives.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis and adherence to the prompt requirements, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. The recommendation aligns with the verified facts, and the response is free from errors or bias.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the claim using credible sources and logical reasoning, adhering strictly to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-supported by evidence from multiple credible sources.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
