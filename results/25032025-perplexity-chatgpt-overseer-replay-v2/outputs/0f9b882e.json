The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Fresno State vs. Nevada basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 4:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Nevada wins, it's p1; Fresno State, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game should have already happened. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the game on March 12. For example, result [1] from nevadawolfpack.com states Nevada defeated Fresno State 86-71 in the Mountain West Tournament opener. Similarly, result [6] from gobulldogs.com confirms Fresno State's season ended with a 86-71 loss to Nevada on March 12. Other sources like [11], [13], [15], and [16] all corroborate Nevada's victory. \n\nI need to check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game taking place as scheduled, with detailed stats and reports, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. The final score from multiple sources is consistent: Nevada won 86-71. \n\nSince the game occurred and Nevada won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information about the outcome, and all sources agree on Nevada's victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Fresno State vs. Nevada men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 4:30 PM ET concluded with a **86-71 victory for Nevada** in the Mountain West Tournament opener[1][6][11][13][15][16]. The game was played as scheduled at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, with no postponement or cancellation reported[1][6][15]. Nevada dominated early, building a 28-7 lead in the first half and maintaining control throughout[11][15]. Key contributors included Kobe Sanders (17 points, 10 assists) and Nick Davidson (11 points, 11 rebounds)[1][13][16]. Fresno State's season ended with a 6-26 record[15].\n\n**Resolution conditions met**:  \n- **Nevada won** (p1 resolution) as defined by ancillary data  \n- No postponement or cancellation occurred  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"p1\" if Nevada wins. The response correctly ignores potential outcomes that did not occur, such as postponement or cancellation, as there is no evidence suggesting these events happened.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and outcome of the game, then verifying that no postponement or cancellation occurred. It uses multiple sources to corroborate the outcome, which strengthens the reliability of the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event through multiple credible sources and aligns the recommendation (p1) directly with the verified outcome of the event. This is in strict adherence to the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information and focuses solely on the event in question as per the user prompt's instructions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria effectively.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933549 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:12:29 UTC"
