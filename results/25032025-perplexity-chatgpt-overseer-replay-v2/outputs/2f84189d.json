The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Creighton vs. Louisville basketball game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Creighton wins, the market resolves to \"Creighton\" (p2), if Louisville wins, it's \"Louisville\" (p1), and if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). If the game is postponed, the market stays open until completion. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 20. So the game should have taken place. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [6] from ESPN clearly states that Creighton defeated Louisville 89-75 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on March 20. This is a direct confirmation of the game's result. Additionally, source [12] from Creighton's official site mentions their victory and advancement to the next round. Other sources like [2] and [11] also discuss the game's details, further corroborating the outcome. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All references to the game indicate it was played as scheduled. Since the game was completed and Creighton won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Creighton). \n\nI also need to ensure that there's no conflicting information. Some sources like [9] and [11] had predictions favoring Louisville, but the actual result from [6] overrules any predictions. The final score and outcome are clear. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nCreighton defeated Louisville 89-75 in their March Madness first-round game on March 20, 2025, as verified by multiple sources[6][12]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation[6][12]. \n\nKey details:\n- Final score: **Creighton 89**, Louisville 75[6]\n- Creighton's Jamiya Neal had a career-high 29 points and 12 rebounds[6]\n- The Bluejays led by 20 points in the first half and maintained control throughout[2][6]\n- Louisville coach Pat Kelsey received a technical foul during the game[10]\n\nThe outcome meets the resolution condition for p2 (\"Creighton\") as defined in the ancillary data. There's no evidence supporting cancellation (p3) or Louisville victory (p1). \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
