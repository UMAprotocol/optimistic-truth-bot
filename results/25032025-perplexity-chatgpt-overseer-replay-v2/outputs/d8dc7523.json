The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for a Knicks vs. Spurs game that was scheduled for March 19, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Knicks win, it's p2; if the Spurs win, p1; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 19 is in the past. Next, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8]) report that the Spurs defeated the Knicks 120-105 on March 19. For example, source [1] mentions the Spurs' victory with Mamukelashvili's career-high 34 points. Source [3] from ESPN confirms the final score and outcome. \n\nSince the event occurred and the Spurs won, according to the resolution conditions, p1 corresponds to a Spurs win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game being completed as scheduled with a Spurs victory. Therefore, the correct resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs scheduled for March 19, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET concluded with the **San Antonio Spurs defeating the New York Knicks 120-105**[1][2][3][4][5]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Spurs' standout performance**: Sandro Mamukelashvili scored a career-high 34 points (13/14 FG, 7/7 3PT) in just 19 minutes, setting an NBA record for most points scored in under 20 minutes[1][3][6].  \n- **Supporting contributions**: Stephon Castle added 22 points for the Spurs, while Chris Paul had 12 points and 9 assists[3][4].  \n- **Knicks' effort**: Karl-Anthony Towns led New York with 32 points and 9 rebounds[2][5].  \n\nThe game was played as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1-8]. Since the Spurs won decisively, the resolution aligns with **p1** per the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the game took place in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which consistently report a Spurs win with a score of 120-105. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Spurs win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and gathers evidence from reliable sources to determine the outcome. It correctly ignores any possibilities of postponement or cancellation as there are no indications of such events from the sources cited.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The alignment with the ancillary data is precise, recommending p1 for a Spurs win, which is consistent with the verified outcome.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions set out in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926613 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:16:53 UTC"
