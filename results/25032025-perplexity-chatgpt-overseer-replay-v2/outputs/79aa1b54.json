        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Pacers vs. Bucks game scheduled for March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Bucks win, it's p1; Pacers win, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually happened on that date. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the game took place. For example, result [9] is a YouTube video titled \"PACERS at BUCKS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | March 15, 2025\" which clearly indicates the game was played. Result [10] from CBS Sports provides a detailed box score and recap, confirming the Bucks won 126-119. Similarly, result [11] from Sportskeeda also reports the Bucks' victory with a final score of 126-119. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The search results include articles about other postponed games, like the Hawks vs. Rockets (result [2]) and Lakers vs. Spurs (result [7]), but none about the Pacers-Bucks game being postponed. All relevant sources here discuss the game as having occurred.\n\nAdditionally, result [8] from SI.com states that the Bucks secured a win over the Pacers on March 16, which might be a typo since other sources list March 15. However, the key point is that the game was played and the Bucks won. The box scores and recaps from multiple sources (results [9], [10], [11], [12]) all confirm the Bucks' victory. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and the Bucks won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable here. All evidence points to the game occurring with a clear outcome in favor of the Milwaukee Bucks.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and Milwaukee Bucks scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET was played as planned. The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Indiana Pacers with a final score of **126-119**[9][10][11]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Giannis Antetokounmpo** led the Bucks with 34 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists[9][10].\n- **Damian Lillard** added 25 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists[9][10].\n- The Pacers\u2019 **Aaron Nesmith** scored a career-high 30 points, but the team\u2019s late comeback fell short[11][15].\n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by multiple verified reports, including box scores, highlights, and recaps[9][10][11][12]. Since the Bucks won, the market resolves to **p1** per the ancillary data.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926912 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:21:52 UTC"
