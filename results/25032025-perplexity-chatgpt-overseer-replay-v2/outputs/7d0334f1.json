The ancillary data specifies that if the Clippers win, it's p1; Grizzlies win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game happened four days ago. Checking the search results, multiple sources (1, 3, 5, 6) report the Clippers won 128-108. For example, ESPN's recap [1] states the Clippers' victory with Harden and Leonard leading. Sportskeeda [3] also mentions the Clippers dominated the second half. The LA Times article [6] confirms the 128-108 score and a fifth straight win for the Clippers. \n\nNext, ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources reference the March 21 date, and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. The box scores and recaps are detailed, indicating the game was completed. \n\nSince the Clippers won definitively, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information in the sources; all align on the Clippers' victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Clippers on March 21, 2025, resulted in a **Clippers victory** with a final score of **128-108**[1][3][6]. James Harden led the Clippers with 30 points and 9 assists, while Kawhi Leonard added 23 points and 10 rebounds[1][5]. The Clippers overcame a six-point halftime deficit with a dominant second-half performance, outscoring the Grizzlies 68-42 after halftime[3][6]. \n\nKey factors in the outcome included:\n- The Clippers' defensive adjustments, holding Memphis to 16 points in the third quarter[3]\n- Memphis' continued struggles without injured star Ja Morant, who missed his fourth consecutive game[1]\n- Los Angeles' 3-0 season sweep of Memphis, extending their winning streak against the Grizzlies to six games[2][6]\n\nThe game was played as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][3][4][6]. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **\"Clippers\"** (p1) as the decisive outcome occurred per the terms.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response uses multiple sources to verify the outcome, ensuring that the game was not postponed or canceled, and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks for the game's completion, its outcome, and any potential deviations such as postponement or cancellation. The response then correctly aligns the outcome with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, recommending a resolution to \"Clippers\" (p1) based on the Clippers' victory.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response cross-references multiple reliable sources to confirm the game's outcome and that it occurred as scheduled. There is no missing information, bias, or errors detected in the response.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event, aligns with the resolution conditions, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and checks for any deviations such as postponement or cancellation.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.
