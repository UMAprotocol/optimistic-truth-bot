        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the UCLA vs. Tennessee basketball game that was scheduled for March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Tennessee wins, it's p1; if UCLA wins, p2; if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date provided is March 25, 2025, which is after March 22. So the game should have taken place. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) report that Tennessee defeated UCLA 67-58 on March 22. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game was played and concluded. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All the search results from CBS Sports, the official Tennessee and UCLA athletics websites, and other news outlets confirm Tennessee's victory. There's no mention of the game being rescheduled or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Tennessee won, the market should resolve to p1.\n\nI also need to check if any sources suggest a different outcome, but all point to Tennessee's win. The user's ancillary data aligns with this result. No need to consider p3 because the game was completed. So the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nTennessee defeated UCLA 67-58 in their NCAA Tournament second-round game on March 22, 2025, advancing to the Sweet 16[1][2][3][5][6][7]. The Volunteers secured the victory with strong defensive play and key performances from Chaz Lanier (20 points, 4/5 three-pointers) and Zakai Zeigler (15 points)[1][2][5]. The game concluded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, meeting all specified resolution conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The AI checked multiple sources to confirm that Tennessee won the game, which aligns with the user's resolution conditions. The response adheres to the instruction to verify the event's occurrence and outcome through reliable sources and to ensure the event has already occurred before making a resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It confirms the game was not postponed or canceled and that Tennessee won, leading to the resolution of p1. The response includes details from the game, such as the score and key performances, which supports the resolution decision and provides completeness.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verified the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple sources, which is a strong point in its favor. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Tennessee win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The AI did not rely on assumptions or predictions and strictly adhered to verified facts.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935787 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:49:47 UTC"
