The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chicago Blackhawks vs. Vancouver Canucks game scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Canucks win, it's p1; if the Blackhawks win, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event should have already happened. Now, looking at the search results, several sources ([3], [4], [8]) report the game took place on March 15, 2025. Specifically, source [3] from NHL.com and [4] from CBS Sports both confirm the Canucks won 6-2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nNext, verifying the outcome: multiple sources detail the Canucks' victory. For example, source [3] states, \"Elias Pettersson, Conor Garland and Pius Suter each had a goal and assist for the Vancouver Canucks in a 6-2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks.\" Similarly, source [4] mentions the final score and key players contributing to the Canucks' win. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that a Canucks win resolves to p1. Since the game was played and Vancouver won, the correct resolution is p1. There's no indication of cancellation or postponement, so p3 isn't applicable here. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Chicago Blackhawks and Vancouver Canucks scheduled for March 15, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET was played as planned. According to multiple verified sources, the Vancouver Canucks defeated the Chicago Blackhawks with a final score of **6-2**[3][4][8]. Key contributions came from Elias Pettersson, Conor Garland, and Pius Suter, who each recorded a goal and an assist[3][4]. The Canucks secured their second consecutive win, while the Blackhawks extended their losing streak to four games[3][8].  \n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no evidence suggests irregularities affecting the outcome. Per the resolution conditions, since the Vancouver Canucks won, the market resolves to **p1**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and outcome based on reliable sources, aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided, and adheres to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between the Blackhawks and Canucks) occurred on the scheduled date of March 15, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. The outcome of the game is verified with multiple sources, confirming the Canucks' victory, which aligns with the resolution condition p1 for a Canucks win.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the sequence of verification: checking the event date against the current date, confirming the event occurred as scheduled, and verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It comprehensively covers all scenarios outlined in the user prompt (win, postponement, cancellation) and confirms the applicable scenario.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome and correctly aligns this with the ancillary data's resolution condition (p1 for a Canucks win). The sources are cited, adding to the credibility and traceability of the information.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and conditions provided without assuming or predicting outcomes.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its strict adherence to the guidelines provided in the system prompt, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns with the resolution conditions, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event details and outcome, providing a clear and accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
