        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Detroit Red Wings vs. Colorado Avalanche game on March 25, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Avalanche win, it's p1; if the Red Wings win, p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current timestamp is March 26, 2025, so the game date (March 25) is in the past. That means the event has already occurred, so I don't have to worry about it being postponed or in the future. \n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find out who won. The first result [1] is a game recap titled \"Nathan MacKinnon has goal and assist as the Avalanche beat Red Wings 5-2\". That clearly states Colorado won 5-2. The same result mentions the Avalanche's victory and the score. \n\nLooking at [2], the Red Wings' recap also confirms the 5-2 loss to the Avalanche. The article quotes their coach and players discussing the loss. Result [3] is a box score that repeats the same outcome. The video recap in [6] also mentions the Avalanche's home win streak extending with this victory. \n\nThe other sources like [4], [5], [7], and [8] either are previews or predictions before the game or unrelated content. The key here is that multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [6]) confirm the Avalanche won 5-2. \n\nSince the game happened, and all credible sources report Colorado's win, the resolution should be p1 (Avalanche). There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. The final answer is straightforward based on the search results.\n</think>\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche defeated the Detroit Red Wings 5-2 in their NHL game on March 25, 2025. Nathan MacKinnon contributed a goal and an assist, while Devon Toews added a goal and two assists, leading Colorado to their 10th consecutive home victory[1][2][3]. The Avalanche overcame an early 1-0 deficit with two first-period goals and maintained control throughout, extending their dominance over Detroit to 13-0-1 in their last 14 meetings[1][3]. \n\nKey factors in the game included:\n- **Power play efficiency**: Colorado converted 3 of 4 power play opportunities, including goals from Toews and MacKinnon[2]\n- **Goaltending**: Mackenzie Blackwood made 21 saves for Colorado, while Detroit's Alex Lyon stopped 23 shots[1][2]\n- **Home ice advantage**: The Avalanche extended their NHL-best home win streak to 10 games, tying the second-longest in franchise history[1][3]\n\nThe outcome aligns with the resolution conditions specified, as the Avalanche secured a regulation victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015688 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:01:28 UTC"
