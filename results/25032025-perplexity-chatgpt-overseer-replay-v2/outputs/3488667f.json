        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Vancouver Canucks vs. New York Rangers game on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Rangers win, it's p1; Canucks win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Checking the search results, multiple sources [1][2][4][5][7][8] report the game occurred on March 22, 2025, with the Rangers winning 5-3. For example, source [1] clearly states the Rangers won 5-3, and others like [4] and [5] mention the Rangers' victory with specific details like Brodzinski's two goals and Shesterkin's saves. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions don't apply to those scenarios here. \n\nSince the Rangers won, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p1. All sources align on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. No conflicting information suggests a different result. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Rangers defeated the Vancouver Canucks 5-3 in their March 22, 2025 matchup at Madison Square Garden[1][4][5]. Key details from the game:\n\n**Game Outcome**  \n- Rangers secured the win with a 4-goal third period after trailing 1-0 early[1][4]  \n- Jonny Brodzinski scored twice, including the game-winning goal at 15:47 of the third period[1][5]  \n- J.T. Miller added an empty-net goal against his former team[1][5]  \n- Igor Shesterkin made 36 saves for New York[1][2]  \n\n**Key Moments**  \n1. Vancouver dominated shots 39-12 but struggled to convert chances[2][4]  \n2. Rangers scored 4 goals on just 6 third-period shots[2]  \n3. The game featured 3 lead changes in the final period[1][5]  \n\n**Context**  \n- The Rangers snapped a 3-game losing streak[1]  \n- Vancouver's Elias Pettersson left injured in the second period[2]  \n- New York honored retiring broadcaster Sam Rosen pregame[1]  \n\nThe game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][6].

The response demonstrates a thorough verification of the event's occurrence and outcome, aligning the recommendation directly with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Canucks vs. Rangers game) occurred on March 22, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. It confirms the Rangers' victory, which matches the user's resolution condition for a Rangers win (p1). The response uses multiple sources to verify the game's outcome, ensuring reliability.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the event's outcome and checks against the conditions for postponement or cancellation. It then aligns the verified outcome with the specified market resolution conditions (p1 for a Rangers win). The reasoning is clear, direct, and well-supported by source citations.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is accurate and up-to-date. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is based on concrete evidence of the Rangers' win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on the event specified in the user prompt and does not introduce irrelevant information.\n\nGiven the thoroughness, accuracy, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and does not require a rerun.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
