The ancillary data specifies that if the Clippers win, it's p1; Cavaliers win, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so March 18 is definitely in the past. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome of that game. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [12]) confirm that the Clippers won the game 132-119. For example, source [1] states, \"The Clippers defeated the Cavaliers, 132-119 tonight in LA,\" and source [4] from ESPN also reports the same score. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All the game summaries and box scores clearly show the Clippers as the winners. \n\nSince the event occurred on the scheduled date and the Clippers won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information in the sources, and all relevant data points agree on the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Clippers on March 18, 2025, concluded with a **132-119 victory for the Clippers**[1][2][4][6]. Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers with 33 points, while Ivica Zubac added 28 points and 20 rebounds[2][4]. The Cavaliers, despite a strong 45-point first quarter, could not maintain their lead, dropping their second consecutive loss[2][4]. \n\nThe game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any verified sources. All available evidence confirms the Clippers secured a decisive win. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Cavaliers vs. Clippers game on March 18, 2025) is in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It verifies the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which all confirm that the Clippers won the game. This is in line with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation, which are absent, thus confirming the game was played as scheduled. The response then aligns this verified outcome with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which dictates that a Clippers win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome accurately. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the ancillary data conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not exhibit any unnecessary information or deviation from the required facts and conditions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the outcome of the event as per the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
