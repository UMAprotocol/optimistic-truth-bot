The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of a boxing match between Trevvy and Oblivion at Adin Ross' Brand Risk 005 event on March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Oblivion wins, the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2), if Trevvy wins, it's \"No\" (p1), and a draw or unresolved by April 15 leads to a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the fight happened 10 days ago. That means the event has already occurred, so I don't need to consider future dates. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the provided sources. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the fight. The YouTube videos [2], [4], [8], [9], and [10] are all from March 15 or later and discuss the event. \n\nIn source [2], the transcript mentions Oblivion winning with a TKO in the first round. The user Adin Ross and others comment on Oblivion's victory, and there's a mention of live odds where Oblivion was the underdog but won. Source [4] also describes the fight, with the narrator reacting to Oblivion's win. Source [9] includes a reaction to the fight, confirming Oblivion's victory by TKO. Source [10] is a post-fight stream by Oblivion himself, where he celebrates the win and discusses future fights, which clearly indicates he won.\n\nAdditionally, the sportskeeda article [6] lists the fight card, confirming that Oblivion vs. Trevvy was part of the event. The resolution conditions state that video evidence or credible reporting should be used. The multiple YouTube sources and the post-fight stream from Oblivion provide credible evidence of the outcome.\n\nThere's no mention of the fight being a draw or postponed. All sources point to Oblivion winning by TKO. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) as per the ancillary data.\n</think>\n\nThe boxing match between Trevvy and Oblivion at Adin Ross' **Brand Risk 005** event on March 15, 2025, concluded with **Oblivion** winning via technical knockout (TKO) in the first round. Multiple sources, including post-fight streams and event reactions, confirm that Oblivion secured the victory after Trevvy failed to recover from a knockdown, leading to an early stoppage by the referee[2][4][9][10].  \n\nKey details:  \n- **Fight outcome**: Oblivion won decisively, with video evidence showing Trevvy unable to continue after being stunned[10].  \n- **Odds**: Oblivion entered as the underdog (2.3x) but outperformed expectations[2][9].  \n- **Post-fight confirmation**: Oblivion discussed the win in a post-event livestream, celebrating his victory and future plans[10].  \n\nNo evidence suggests the match was postponed, canceled, or ruled a draw.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres to the instructions by confirming that the event has already occurred (March 15, 2025, with the current date being March 25, 2025). It uses multiple sources to verify the outcome of the event, which is in line with the requirement to use video evidence or credible reporting. The response identifies that Oblivion won the match by TKO, which matches the resolution condition for a \"Yes\" (p2) outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the steps required to resolve the query. It checks the date to confirm the event is not in the future, identifies the correct event, and uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome. The reasoning is thorough, with checks for any possible conditions like a draw or postponement, which were not met.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through credible sources, including YouTube videos and a sportskeeda article. The recommendation to resolve the market as \"Yes\" (p2) aligns perfectly with the facts presented and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the provided instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742908056 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:07:36 UTC",
