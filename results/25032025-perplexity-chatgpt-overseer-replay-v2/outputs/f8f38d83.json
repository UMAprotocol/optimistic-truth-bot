        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Epstein\" during the Kennedy Center event on March 17, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the ones related to Trump's activities on that date. Looking at the search results, there are several entries about Trump's involvement with the Kennedy Center around March 17, 2025. \n\nSearch result [3] is a YouTube video transcript from March 22, 2025, where Trump is at the Kennedy Center. In the transcript, he mentions Epstein in the context of releasing files. He says, \"you see anything but we've given it we're doing it with Dr martin Luther King too they're preparing all of that they're going to release everything and uh whoever else we they want i mean you know we have nothing we really have nothing to hide we shouldn...\" and later, \"Biden allowed that to happen to our country and his people that really ran the country and the person that operated the autopan i think we ought to find out who that was because I guess that was the real president...\" Wait, does he say \"Epstein\" here? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the transcript in [3], there's a part where Trump is talking about releasing documents. He mentions Epstein indirectly when discussing the release of files related to Epstein and others. However, the exact mention of \"Epstein\" isn't clear here. Let me check other sources.\n\nSearch result [5] is another YouTube video from March 17, 2025, where Trump talks about the Kennedy Center being in disrepair. The transcript here doesn't mention Epstein. Similarly, search result [10] is another video from the same day, but the transcript focuses on the Kennedy Center's condition and management issues, not mentioning Epstein.\n\nSearch result [16] from March 17, 2025, mentions Trump providing an update on Epstein files, but this is from an interview with Sharyl Attkisson, not the Kennedy Center event. The event in question is specifically the board meeting at the Kennedy Center on March 17.\n\nWait, search result [18] is a YouTube video titled \"President Trump announces release date of unredacted JFK files\" from March 17, 2025. The transcript includes Trump saying, \"we are tomorrow announcing and giving uh all of the Kennedy files...\" but he doesn't mention Epstein here either.\n\nLooking back at the ancillary data, the user specifies that the event is the Kennedy Center board meeting on March 17, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET. The resolution depends on whether Trump said \"Epstein\" during that specific appearance. The search results include transcripts from that day's event, but none of them show Trump uttering the word \"Epstein.\" He talks about releasing files related to Epstein in other contexts (like interviews), but not during the Kennedy Center event itself.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, there's no evidence that Trump said \"Epstein\" during the Kennedy Center event on March 17. The market should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nBased on the available evidence, Donald Trump did not mention \"Epstein\" during his March 17, 2025, Kennedy Center board meeting and tour. While Trump discussed releasing classified documents related to Jeffrey Epstein in other contexts around the same time period[1][2][4][16], no transcripts or reports from the specific Kennedy Center event include him using the term \"Epstein\"[3][5][8][10][18]. The closest related remarks at the Kennedy Center focused on:\n\n- Criticizing the venue's management and $250M in questionable renovations[3][5][10]\n- Announcing plans to release unredacted JFK assassination records[18]\n- General commentary about border policies and cultural issues[3][10]\n\nThe resolution conditions specify that only statements made **during the Kennedy Center appearance** qualify. Since none of the verified transcripts or contemporaneous reports from that event show Trump using the word \"Epstein,\" the market resolves to \"No.\"\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately adheres to the user prompt's instructions by focusing on whether Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Epstein\" during the Kennedy Center event on March 17, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the resolution of the market depends solely on Trump's statements during this specific event and disregards any mentions of \"Epstein\" in other contexts or events around the same time.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by methodically checking multiple sources (YouTube video transcripts and interviews) from the specified date to confirm whether Trump mentioned \"Epstein.\" It correctly concludes that Trump did not mention \"Epstein\" during the Kennedy Center event based on the absence of this term in the transcripts from the event itself.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event by referencing specific search results and transcripts from the Kennedy Center event on the specified date. It aligns the recommendation (p1) with the facts gathered from these sources, adhering to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI has focused on the correct event and used appropriate sources to verify the occurrence and content of Trump's statements during the event.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the user prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"No\" (p1) is well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the user prompt, uses logical reasoning, and is supported by verified facts. The recommendation aligns with the resolution conditions specified.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the specified sources to verify the event and Trump's statements during the event, ensuring accuracy in the resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933892 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:18:12 UTC",
