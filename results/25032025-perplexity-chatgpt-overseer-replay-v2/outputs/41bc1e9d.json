The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Golden State Warriors vs. Miami Heat game on March 25, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Warriors win, it's p2 (Warriors), if the Heat win, p1 (Heat), and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 26, 2025, so the game has already happened. Looking at the search results, several sources confirm the game's outcome. The CBS Sports recap [2] states the Heat won 112-86. The YouTube video descriptions [3][4] and the NBC Sports article [5] also mention the Heat's victory. The Fox Sports box score [6][7] shows the final score as Heat 112, Warriors 86. \n\nI should verify if the game was postponed or canceled, but all sources indicate it took place as scheduled. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. The user's resolution conditions don't mention anything about player injuries or other factors affecting the outcome, just the final result. Since the Heat won decisively, the correct resolution should be p1. All sources are consistent, so there's no ambiguity here. The answer is straightforward based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe Miami Heat defeated the Golden State Warriors 112-86 in their March 25, 2025 matchup at Kaseya Center[2][5][6]. Multiple verified sources confirm the Heat led wire-to-wire, with Bam Adebayo scoring 27 points and Miami shooting 68% from three-point range[2][4][5]. The Warriors played without Stephen Curry and saw poor performances from starters, with Jimmy Butler scoring only 11 points in his Miami return[5][8].\n\nKey details:\n- **Final score**: Heat 112, Warriors 86[2][6][7]\n- **Game status**: Completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation mentioned in any sources\n- **Decisive factors**: Miami's 17/25 three-point shooting (68%)[2] and Golden State's 23.7% three-point accuracy[7]\n\nSince the Heat won decisively and the game concluded without cancellation or postponement, the market resolves according to the ancillary data's primary outcome condition. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event has occurred and by checking multiple sources to verify the outcome, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date and then verifying the outcome of the event. It checks for any possible cancellations or postponements, which is crucial for accurate resolution. The response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the market based on the user's conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and that the Miami Heat won the game. The recommendation of p1 (Heat win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome and the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring reliability and reducing the risk of bias.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015907 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:05:07 UTC"
