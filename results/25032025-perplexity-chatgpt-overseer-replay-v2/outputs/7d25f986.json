The ancillary data specifies that if Alabama wins, it's p1; St. Mary's, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Checking the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 14) report that Alabama won 80-66. For example, source [1] is the official University of Alabama Athletics page stating their victory. Sources [2] and [3] from St. Mary's confirm their loss. The score is consistent across these reports. \n\nNext, ensure there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. All sources discuss the game as having taken place, with detailed stats and post-game comments. No indications of the game being incomplete or rescheduled. \n\nSince the game was played as scheduled and Alabama won, the resolution should be p1. All conditions are met: the event occurred, Alabama was the victor, and no cancellations or postponements are noted. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament second-round game between the No. 2 seed Alabama Crimson Tide and No. 7 seed Saint Mary's Gaels occurred as scheduled on March 23, 2025, at 6:10 PM ET. Alabama defeated Saint Mary's 80-66, advancing to their third consecutive Sweet 16[1][2][4][10]. \n\n**Key details confirming the outcome:**\n- Alabama's balanced offense featured six players scoring double figures, led by Chris Youngblood's 13 points[1][4]\n- The Crimson Tide controlled the game throughout, leading for all but 30 seconds and maintaining a double-digit advantage for most of the second half[1][4]\n- Saint Mary's struggled offensively, shooting 25% in the first half and failing to close the gap below seven points in the final 20 minutes[1][2][4]\n- Official box scores show a final score of 80-66 with Alabama listed as the winner[6][10][14]\n\nThe game was completed without postponement or cancellation, with both teams playing their full rosters as evidenced by detailed player statistics and post-game coach interviews[1][2][4]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response adheres to the instructions by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple reliable sources, including the official University of Alabama Athletics page and sources from St. Mary's. The response correctly aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to an Alabama win.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the game's date and outcome, checking for any postponements or cancellations, and then concluding based on the evidence from reliable sources. The reasoning is thorough and complete, covering all necessary aspects to ensure the event is resolved accurately.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event by cross-referencing multiple sources and ensures that the details match the user prompt's specifications. The recommendation of p1 is correctly aligned with the verified outcome of the game.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response is well-rounded and factually supported by evidence from the specified event.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928861 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:54:21 UTC"
