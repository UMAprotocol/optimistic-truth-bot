The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Delhi Capitals vs Lucknow Super Giants IPL match scheduled for March 24, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Delhi wins, it's p2 (Delhi), Lucknow wins p1 (Lucknow), and if the game isn't completed by March 31, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date provided is March 25, 2025, which is after March 24, so the event should have taken place. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the match happened. For example, source [1] mentions Delhi Capitals won by one wicket on March 24. Similarly, [3] and [4] detail Ashutosh Sharma's performance leading Delhi to victory. \n\nNext, verifying the result. All sources agree that Delhi Capitals chased down 210 runs, with Ashutosh Sharma being the key player. The exact score is DC 211/9 in 19.3 overs against LSG's 209/8. The match was completed on the same day, so the March 31 condition isn't triggered. \n\nSince the market resolution depends on the actual outcome and the game was completed with a Delhi win, the correct resolution is p2 (Delhi). No conflicting information in the sources; all point to Delhi's victory. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nDelhi Capitals defeated Lucknow Super Giants by one wicket in their IPL 2025 opener on March 24, 2025, at Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam. Chasing a target of 210, Delhi reached 211/9 in 19.3 overs, with Ashutosh Sharma scoring an unbeaten 66 off 31 balls to seal the victory with a six in the final over[1][3][4]. The match concluded on its scheduled date, and no postponement or cancellation was reported[6][8].\n\n**Key Details:**\n- **Result:** Delhi Capitals won by 1 wicket[1][3][7].\n- **Match Completion:** The game concluded on March 24, 2025, well before the March 31 deadline[1][8].\n- **Resolution Criteria Met:** Since Delhi Capitals won, the market resolves to \"Delhi\" (p2)[1][3][4].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Delhi Capitals vs Lucknow Super Giants IPL match) and the date it occurred (March 24, 2025). The response also accurately reports the outcome of the match, with Delhi Capitals winning, and aligns this outcome with the resolution criteria provided in the user prompt (p2 for a Delhi win).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks whether the event has occurred (it has, on the scheduled date) and verifies the outcome through multiple sources. It confirms that the match was completed on the same day, thus not triggering the March 31 condition for a 50-50 resolution. The reasoning is clear, follows a logical sequence, and covers all necessary aspects to reach a conclusion.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using multiple sources, which is a strong point in ensuring the accuracy of the information. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 (Delhi) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses solely on verified facts and adheres strictly to the conditions set out in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
