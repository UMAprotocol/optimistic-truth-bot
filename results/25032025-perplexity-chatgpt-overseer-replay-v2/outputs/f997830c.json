        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say \"trans\" by March 28, 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he mentions the term between March 21, 6:10 PM ET and March 28, 11:59 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of Trump using the word \"trans\" or its variations within the specified timeframe. The current date is March 26, 2025, so the period in question is from March 21 to March 28. \n\nLooking through the sources, let's note the dates. Source [10] is from March 13, 2025, where Trump said, \"Everybody is transgender.\" That's before the start date of March 21, so it doesn't count. \n\nSource [2] is from March 4, 2025, where he mentioned \"transgender\" multiple times in a speech. Again, before the window. \n\nSource [11] is from February 22, 2025, where he used the term \"transgender insanity.\" Still outside the timeframe. \n\nSource [10] also includes a video from March 12, 2025, but that's still before March 21. \n\nOther sources like [1], [3], [4], [6], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] are all from January, February, or early March 2025, none within the required window. \n\nThe latest source is [9], a YouTube video of Trump addressing Congress on March 4, 2025. The description mentions he talked about anti-trans policies, but the exact term \"trans\" isn't confirmed here. \n\nNo search results fall within March 21 to March 28. The user's current date is March 26, so there's still a couple of days left until March 28. However, based on the provided data, there's no evidence yet of Trump using \"trans\" in the specified period. \n\nSince the event hasn't occurred yet (as of March 26), but the end date is March 28, which is in the future relative to the current timestamp, the resolution should be p4. Wait, but the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. Wait, the user's ancillary data says resolution_conditions: p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. But the instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake. But according to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. But the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. Wait, the query's ancillary data defines the resolution conditions as p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. But the current date is March 26, and the end date is March 28. Since the event is still ongoing (until March 28), but the current time is March 26, the event hasn't concluded. However, the user is asking for a resolution now. But according to the rules, if the event is in the future, we should return p4. But the market's resolution doesn't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, the personalization instructions state: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" Even if the event is ongoing but hasn't concluded, if the current date is before the end date, it's still considered future. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This might be an error in the setup, but according to the rules, we must follow the personalization instructions. Therefore, despite the market's resolution options, the answer should be p4. But the user's ancillary data might have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended p3 for unresolved cases. But the instructions are clear: if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is a conflict. \n\nBut given the strict instructions, the assistant must follow the personalization rules. Since the event end date is March 28, which is after the current date of March 26, the event is still ongoing/future. Therefore, the recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This might be an inconsistency, but according to the rules, the answer must be p4. \n\nAlternatively, if the market's resolution conditions don't have p4, but the event is ongoing, perhaps the assistant should default to p3 (unknown/50-50). But the personalization instructions say to return p4 regardless. \n\nThis is a bit confusing, but based on the strict rules, the correct answer is p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't have p4. This might be an error in the setup, but the assistant must follow the instructions. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The response correctly identifies the timeframe for the event (March 21 to March 28, 2025) and the current date (March 26, 2025).\n2. It accurately reviews and dismisses sources that mention the term \"trans\" outside the specified timeframe.\n3. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on verifiable instances of the term \"trans\" being used by Donald Trump within the defined period.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The response exhibits confusion regarding the resolution conditions and the appropriate recommendation to make based on the event's ongoing status relative to the current date.\n2. There is an overemphasis on the internal conflict about whether to use p4 or another resolution condition, which detracts from the clarity and decisiveness of the response.\n3. The response could improve by more succinctly stating that since the event date is still in the future relative to the current timestamp, the correct recommendation should be p4, as per the system prompt instructions.\n\nThe response is logically sound in its analysis of the sources and the determination that no evidence currently exists of Trump using the term \"trans\" within the specified timeframe. However, it struggles with the procedural aspect of selecting the correct resolution recommendation based on the event's ongoing status.\n\nGiven the critical rule that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always result in a retry, and considering the response's confusion about the resolution condition, a retry is necessary to ensure clarity and adherence to procedural instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response shows confusion about the resolution condition and overemphasizes internal conflict, which could be clarified in another attempt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response needs to streamline its analysis and focus more on the procedural aspects of making a recommendation based on the event's ongoing status.

        "attempt": 2,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say \"trans\" by March 28, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he mentions the term between March 21, 6:10 PM ET and March 28, 11:59 PM ET. The current date is March 26, 2025, so we're in the middle of that window. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump using the word \"trans\" during the specified period. Let's go through each source. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of them discuss Trump's executive orders and policies targeting transgender people. For example, sources [1], [5], [6], [10], [12], and [15] all talk about his actions against transgender rights. However, these sources are from January to March 2025, but the key is whether he actually used the word \"trans\" in the specified time frame.\n\nSource [12] mentions a speech Trump gave on March 4, 2025, where he called for banning sex changes on children. The article quotes him saying, \"This is a big lie... you are perfect, exactly the way God made you.\" But the word \"trans\" isn't mentioned here. \n\nSource [17] is about his March 4 speech to Congress. The Wikipedia entry details the event but doesn't mention him using the word \"trans.\" The speech focused on various policies, including anti-trans measures, but the exact terminology isn't specified in the provided excerpt.\n\nOther sources, like [2], [3], and [7], reference Trump's past statements against transgender issues, using terms like \"transgender lunacy\" or \"transgender insanity,\" but these are from December 2024 and August 2024, outside the current window.\n\nThe latest source is [11], dated March 10, 2025, which discusses a protest against Trump's policies. It mentions his executive orders but doesn't indicate he used the word \"trans\" in any public statement during the relevant period.\n\nSince the current date is March 26, and the window ends on March 28, there's still a couple of days left. However, based on the provided sources up to March 10, there's no evidence that Trump has used the exact term \"trans\" in the specified timeframe. His speeches and executive orders refer to \"transgender\" but not the abbreviated form \"trans.\" The resolution conditions state that the exact word or minor misspellings count, but \"transgender\" is a different term. Therefore, unless there's a mention of \"trans\" specifically in the remaining days, the answer would be \"No.\" \n\nBut wait, the user's ancillary data says that pluralization or possessive forms count. So if he said \"trans\" in any form, like \"trans\" or \"trans's,\" that would qualify. However, the search results don't show any instance of him using the abbreviated form during the period. All mentions are of \"transgender.\" Since \"trans\" is a common abbreviation, maybe he used it in a tweet or a speech not covered in the provided sources. But according to the given data, there's no evidence. \n\nAlso, the sources provided don't include any social media posts from Trump during March 21-28. Without access to his recent tweets or statements beyond March 10, we can't confirm. However, based on the available information, it's likely he hasn't used \"trans\" in the specified window. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1 (No). But since the event is still ongoing (until March 28), and the current date is March 26, there's a possibility he might mention it in the remaining two days. However, the instructions say if the event date is in the future relative to the current timestamp, default to p4. Wait, the event end date is March 28, which is two days after March 26. So the event is still ongoing. According to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But the event's end is March 28, which is in the future from March 26. Therefore, even though part of the window has passed, since the end date hasn't occurred yet, we should recommend p4. \n\nBut the user's query is whether he will say it by March 28. The current date is March 26, so the event is ongoing. The instructions say if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. However, the event is currently ongoing (started March 21, ends March 28). The personalization update says to default to p4 if the event is ongoing and the end date is in the future. Therefore, even if there's no evidence yet, because the event hasn't concluded, the recommendation is p4. \n\nWait, but the user's ancillary data says resolution is based on whether he mentioned it during the window, which is part in the past and part in the future. Since the current date is March 26, the period from March 21 to March 26 is in the past, and March 27-28 is future. If there's no mention in the past period, but the future period is still pending, the recommendation should be p4 because the event hasn't concluded. However, the instructions also say that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But here, part of the event is in the past (March 21-26) and part in the future (27-28). Since the end date is March 28, which is in the future, the entire event isn't concluded. Therefore, per the rules, we must return p4. \n\nBut the user's personalization update says to try to find info leading to p1/p2/p3 before defaulting to p4. So check if in the past period (March 21-26), there's any mention. The latest source is March 10, which is before the window. The other sources don't cover March 21-26. Since the provided search results don't include any data from March 21-26, we can't confirm if he said \"trans\" during that time. Therefore, without information, we can't assume he did. But since the event is ongoing, we can't definitively say \"No\" yet. Hence, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results provided, there is no evidence that Donald Trump has used the term \"trans\" (as specified in the resolution conditions) between March 21, 2025 (6:10 PM ET) and the current timestamp of March 26, 2025 (7:41:22 PM UTC). The available sources detail Trump's anti-transgender executive orders and policy statements from January to early March 2025, but none include direct mentions of the abbreviated term \"trans\" during the specified window.\n\nKey considerations:\n- The resolution window remains open until March 28, 2025 (11:59 PM ET), leaving 2 days remaining\n- All documented uses of related terms like \"transgender\" in the provided materials fall outside the resolution window or use the full term rather than the abbreviated \"trans\"\n- No social media posts or official communications from Trump containing the term \"trans\" are cited in the search results for the relevant period\n\nGiven that the event's end date (March 28) remains in the future relative to the current timestamp, and absent conclusive evidence of the term's use within the active resolution window, this remains an unresolved ongoing event.\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event in question (whether Trump will say \"trans\" by March 28, 2025) is still ongoing, with the current date being March 26, 2025. The response correctly notes that no evidence has been found of Trump using the term \"trans\" within the specified timeframe up to the current date. This aligns well with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a thorough search through the available sources and correctly concludes that there is no evidence of the term \"trans\" being used by Trump in the specified window up to the current date. It also correctly identifies that the term \"transgender\" does not meet the resolution conditions as it is not a minor misspelling or alternative spelling of \"trans.\"\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event is still ongoing and correctly applies the rule that if the event's end date is in the future relative to the current timestamp, the recommendation should be p4. This is in line with the instructions provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
