The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Pistons vs. Pelicans game scheduled for March 17, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Pistons win, it's p2; if the Pelicans win, p1; if postponed, it stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place on that date. Looking at the search results, there's a recap from ESPN (source [1]) dated March 17, 2025, detailing the Pistons' 127-81 victory over the Pelicans. Another source [4] from CBS Sports confirms the same score and date, mentioning Cade Cunningham's performance. Source [5] also discusses the Pelicans' historic loss to the Pistons on that date. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no postponement or cancellation. Source [3] talks about a postponed game between the Pelicans and Bucks in January 2025 due to a snowstorm, but that's a different date and opponent. The game in question on March 17 isn't mentioned as postponed or canceled in any of the provided sources. All relevant sources indicate the game was played as scheduled.\n\nSince the game occurred, and the Pistons won decisively, the resolution should be p2 according to the ancillary data. There's no mention of the game being canceled or requiring a 50-50 split. All evidence points to a completed game with a clear outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe Detroit Pistons defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 127-81 on March 17, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources detailing the game's outcome[1][4][5]. The Pistons dominated with Cade Cunningham scoring 24 points and Simone Fontecchio adding 23 off the bench, while the Pelicans suffered their seventh loss in eight games[1][4]. The game was not postponed or canceled, as evidenced by the absence of any weather-related disruptions or announcements in the search results for that specific date[3][7]. Since the Pistons won decisively, the market resolves to **p2** per the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response also correctly ignores irrelevant information about other games and focuses solely on the event in question.\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The AI uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome and checks that there were no disruptions on the specified date, which supports the resolution recommendation of \"p2.\"\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
