The ancillary data specifies that if the Wizards win, it's p2 (Wizards), Nuggets win is p1 (Nuggets), postponed stays open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 26, 2025, so the game on March 15 is definitely in the past. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome of the game. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. Source [1] and [2] both state that the Wizards won 126-123 with Jordan Poole hitting the game-winning 3-pointer. The box score in [7] and the recap in [11] also back this up. Even though the Nuggets were heavily favored, as seen in the predictions from [9] and [14], the Wizards pulled off an upset. \n\nThere's a mention in [3] about an officiating mistake in the last two minutes, but the article clarifies that it didn't affect the final outcome. The NBA's report admitted a defensive three-second violation wasn't called, but the Wizards still deserved the win. \n\nAll sources agree on the final score and the Wizards' victory. No indications of postponement or cancellation. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2, which corresponds to the Wizards winning.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Wizards defeated the Denver Nuggets 126-123 in their March 15, 2025 NBA game at Ball Arena. Jordan Poole's 35-foot 3-pointer with 2.1 seconds remaining sealed the victory for Washington, marking their second win over Denver in the 2024-25 season[1][2][3]. \n\nKey details:\n- **Alex Sarr** led the Wizards with a career-high 34 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists\n- **Nikola Jokic** recorded 40 points, 13 rebounds, and 9 assists for Denver\n- The game featured 11 lead changes and 6 ties in the final 5 minutes[8]\n- Russell Westbrook surpassed 26,000 career points during the contest[1]\n\nWhile the NBA's Last Two Minute Report identified a missed defensive three-second violation on Washington's Kyshawn George with 1:01 remaining, officials determined this didn't materially affect the outcome[3]. The Wizards improved to 15-51 with the win, while the Nuggets fell to 45-28[11].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

This level of detail supports the accuracy of the event's verification. The response also correctly aligns the resolution recommendation (p2) with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p2 corresponds to a Wizards win.\n\nThere are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The AI does not speculate or infer outcomes but relies on concrete evidence from reliable sources to determine the result of the game. The response also correctly ignores any potential implications of the officiating mistake mentioned, as it did not affect the final outcome, adhering strictly to the facts.\n\nThe response is logically sound, complete, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided. It verifies the event's occurrence and context as specified in the user prompt and ensures that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
