The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Davidson vs. Saint Louis basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 2:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if St. Louis wins, it's p1; Davidson, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on that date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the event should have occurred. Let me look through the search results to confirm the outcome.\n\nSearch result [2] from slubillikens.com states that Saint Louis (No. 5 seed) defeated Davidson (No. 12 seed) 83-75 on March 13 in the A-10 Championship. That's a clear win for St. Louis. Another source [6] from davidsonwildcats.com also mentions the loss to Saint Louis, and [8] from slubillikens.com again confirms the victory. \n\nAll the sources point to Saint Louis winning the game on the scheduled date. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (St. Louis). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other sources like [1], [4], [5], and [7] discuss the game's odds and stats but don't contradict the outcome. The final scores from the official team websites are reliable. No sources indicate the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nThus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Davidson vs. Saint Louis men's basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 2:00 PM ET occurred as planned. **Saint Louis defeated Davidson 83-75** in a second-round matchup of the Atlantic 10 Conference Men's Basketball Championship at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C.[2]. Key details:\n\n- **Saint Louis** (No. 5 seed, 19-13 record) advanced to the quarterfinals, while **Davidson** (No. 12 seed, 17-16) concluded its season[2].\n- The Billikens\u2019 victory was fueled by strong performances from Isaiah Swope (26 points) and Gibson Jimerson (25 points, six 3-pointers), with Robbie Avila adding a double-double (13 points, 11 rebounds)[2].\n- The game was competitive, with Davidson briefly leading 51-47 in the second half before Saint Louis rallied with an 11-0 run and held the lead thereafter[2].\n\nNo evidence suggests the game was postponed or canceled.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Davidson vs. Saint Louis basketball game occurred on March 13, 2025, and that Saint Louis won the game. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring that the information is reliable and verifiable. This aligns with the system's requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event has occurred. It then verifies the outcome through multiple sources, ensuring there is no conflicting information about the game being postponed or canceled. This thorough verification process supports the decision to resolve the market to p1 (Saint Louis win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through credible sources, aligning the recommendation with the facts. The sources cited are specific and relevant, providing a clear and direct confirmation of the game's result.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt and system instructions, focusing solely on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923410 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:23:30 UTC"
