The ancillary data specifies that if the Jazz win, it's p1; if the Wizards win, p2; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date of March 19. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the result of that game using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] from CBS Sports states the Jazz won 128-112. Source [2] from ESPN also reports the same score and outcome. Source [3] from Deseret News mentions the Jazz ended a 10-game losing streak with this win. Source [6] from Fox Sports lists the final score as 128-112 in favor of the Jazz. Additionally, the YouTube highlights in sources [4] and [8] reference the Jazz's victory. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game having taken place as scheduled with the Utah Jazz winning. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Jazz). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Some sources like [9] discuss the Wizards' need to lose for draft positioning, which aligns with the Jazz's victory. No sources indicate a different outcome. All confirm the Jazz won, so the resolution is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Washington Wizards and Utah Jazz on March 19, 2025, concluded with a **128-112 victory for the Utah Jazz**[1][2][6]. This ended the Jazz\u2019s 10-game losing streak, with standout performances from Kyle Filipowski (21 points) and Keyonte George (20 points)[1][3]. The Wizards\u2019 Colby Jones scored a career-high 24 points, but Jordan Poole struggled, finishing with just 2 points[1][2].  \n\nThe game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, and the Jazz secured a decisive win. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p1** (Jazz).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of event, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the NBA game between the Washington Wizards and the Utah Jazz took place on March 19, 2025, and that the Utah Jazz won with a score of 128-112. This information aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market. The response correctly uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the outcome of the game, ensuring that the information is not based on a single source and thus reducing the risk of inaccuracies.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources. It checks the current date against the game date to confirm that the event has occurred. It then verifies the outcome of the game through multiple sources and confirms that there was no postponement or cancellation. This thorough verification process supports the logical flow from the event occurrence to the resolution recommendation.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the game was neither postponed nor canceled. The alignment of the recommendation with the facts is precise, as the verified outcome (Jazz win) directly leads to the resolution of p1, as specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not exhibit any preference or assumption beyond what is presented in the sources. All necessary information to resolve the query is included, and there is no missing information that could affect the resolution's accuracy.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It adheres strictly to the user prompt instructions, uses verified facts to resolve the query, and provides a clear and accurate recommendation based on the event's outcome. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources, adheres to the user prompt instructions, and logically concludes with a correct resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome and aligns the resolution recommendation precisely with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923725 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:28:45 UTC"
