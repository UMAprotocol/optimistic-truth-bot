        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if GELO's song \"Can You Please\" featuring GloRilla is on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of March 29, 2025. The resolution depends on the data from Billboard, and the market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if it's on the chart, otherwise \"No\" (p1). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. Let's go through each source to find relevant information about the song's chart performance. \n\nLooking at source [5], it mentions that \"Can You Please\" debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100. The Bubbling Under chart is different from the main Hot 100, so that's a key point. The article is from March 18, 2025, which is before the target week of March 29. So this indicates that as of March 18, the song was on the Bubbling Under chart, not the main Hot 100.\n\nSource [6] (Wikipedia) states the song was released on March 7, 2025, and provides background but no direct info on the Hot 100 for the week in question. \n\nSource [9] is a YouTube video listing the Billboard Hot 100 and Bubbling Under for March 29, 2025. In the Bubbling Under section, \"Can You Please\" isn't listed, but the main Hot 100 drop-outs include \"Tweaker\" at position 29. However, the user is asking about \"Can You Please,\" not \"Tweaker.\" The Bubbling Under chart in source [9] shows that \"Can You Please\" isn't in the main Hot 100 for that week. \n\nSource [10] mentions that \"Tweaker\" reached No. 1 on Rhythmic Airplay but also notes that \"Can You Please\" is gaining traction and aims to enter the charts. However, this is from March 24, which is still before the target week. The article says it's \"expected\" but doesn't confirm placement. \n\nSource [11] from March 19 states that \"Can You Please\" debuted at No. 12 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100, which again is a different chart. \n\nThe key point here is the distinction between the Bubbling Under Hot 100 and the main Hot 100. The Bubbling Under chart lists songs that are below the top 100 but have potential to enter. The user's query specifically asks about the main Hot 100. \n\nLooking at the most recent data in source [9], which is a video dated March 25, 2025, listing the Hot 100 for March 29, \"Can You Please\" isn't present in the main chart. The Bubbling Under chart in the same source also doesn't list it, but that might be because it's already moved or dropped out. However, the main Hot 100 for that week (as per the drop-outs listed) doesn't include \"Can You Please.\" \n\nTherefore, based on the available data from the search results, particularly source [9], \"Can You Please\" by GELO featuring GloRilla did not make the Billboard Hot 100 for the week of March 29, 2025. It was on the Bubbling Under chart earlier but didn't break into the main Hot 100 by the target week. \n\nThus, the market should resolve to \"No,\" which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nGELO's \"Can You Please\" (feat. GloRilla) did **not** appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of March 29, 2025. While the track debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart on March 18[5][6][11], it failed to enter the main Hot 100 during the tracking period ending March 20. The March 29 Hot 100 chart[9] shows no listing for the song, while GELO's previous hit \"Tweaker\" dropped out of the chart entirely after peaking at No. 29 earlier in 2025[7][9].\n\nThe song's performance metrics included:\n- 4.2 million Spotify streams in its first week[4]\n- Strong radio momentum with a 112% play increase[10]\n- No. 1 \"Most Added\" status at Overall Radio[3][10]\n\nHowever, these efforts weren't sufficient to break into the Hot 100's top 100 positions during the specified week. The resolution source (Billboard's March 29 chart[9]) confirms the absence of \"Can You Please\" from the main chart.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743017635 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:33:55 UTC",
