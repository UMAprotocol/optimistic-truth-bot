        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Wyoming vs. San Jos\u00e9 State basketball game that was scheduled for March 12, 2025. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already occurred. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. Looking at the search results, multiple sources like [2], [3], [5], [6], [8], [15], and [20] confirm that the game took place on March 12, 2025. The final score is consistently reported as San Jos\u00e9 State 66-61 Wyoming. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome. All these sources mention San Jos\u00e9 State's victory. For example, source [2] states, \"Wyoming\u2019s season came to an end in the first round of the Mountain West Tournament on Wednesday as the Cowboys struggled from beyond the arc in a 66-61 loss to No. 8 seed San Jose State.\" Similarly, source [3] from ESPN and [20] from CBS Sports both report the same score and outcome. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if San Jos\u00e9 State wins, the market resolves to p1. Since the game was not postponed or canceled, and San Jos\u00e9 State won, the correct resolution is p1. There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed in any of the sources, so the 50-50 resolution (p3) doesn't apply here. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all sources align on the result. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe March 12, 2025 Mountain West Tournament game between Wyoming and San Jos\u00e9 State concluded with San Jos\u00e9 State winning 66-61[2][3][5][6][8][15][20]. The Spartans led wire-to-wire despite a late Wyoming comeback attempt that narrowed the deficit to three points with 21.9 seconds remaining[2][15]. Key factors included San Jos\u00e9 State's 8 three-pointers compared to Wyoming's 2-of-19 shooting from beyond the arc[2][15], and 15 points scored off Wyoming's 14 turnovers[15].\n\nThe game was played as scheduled at Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[1][2][3][4][5][6][8][15][20]. As the event occurred on its original date and San Jos\u00e9 State secured the victory, the resolution aligns with the ancillary data's defined outcome for a Spartans win.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
