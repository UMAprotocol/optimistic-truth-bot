The ancillary data specifies that if the Pistons win, it's p2; Mavericks win, p1; postponed remains open; canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 21, so the game should have happened. Let me look through the search results to confirm the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]) report that the Dallas Mavericks defeated the Detroit Pistons 123-117 on March 21. For example, source [1] states the Mavericks won 123-117, and source [5] from ESPN also confirms the same score. \n\nSome sources like [8] and [10] had predictions favoring the Pistons, but the actual result was a Mavericks victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the results. All reports indicate the game took place as scheduled with a clear outcome. \n\nSince the Mavericks won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. The ancillary data doesn't mention any other conditions affecting the resolution, and all sources confirm the game was completed without issues. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks defeated the Detroit Pistons 123-117 in their NBA game played on March 21, 2025, as scheduled. Multiple verified sources confirm this outcome, with Spencer Dinwiddie (31 points) and P.J. Washington (27 points) leading Dallas to victory[1][3][5]. The game was completed without postponement or cancellation, and no subsequent rescheduling occurred[4][5]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided:\n- **p1** (Mavericks win) applies since Dallas secured victory\n- No evidence exists for postponement or cancellation requiring p3 resolution\n- All game reports confirm completion under normal circumstances\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The AI checked multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is a Mavericks win. This is in line with the requirement to use verified facts and concrete evidence.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event date and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (p1 for Mavericks win) based on the verified outcome of the game.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the game was not postponed or canceled and that it concluded with a Mavericks victory. This aligns perfectly with the resolution condition p1 as specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI did not rely on predictions or speculative sources but rather on confirmed reports of the game's outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931691 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:41:31 UTC"
