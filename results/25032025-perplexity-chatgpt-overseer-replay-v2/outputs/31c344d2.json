The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of that specific event. The search results include several sources related to Trump's crypto policies and events. Let's look through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [10] is a transcript from March 24, 2025, titled \"President Trump and the Governor of Louisiana Deliver Remarks.\" However, the content provided doesn't include the actual transcript, just a notice about the event. Source [13] is a YouTube video titled \"LIVE: Pres. Trump, Louisiana Gov. Landry deliver remarks\" from March 24, 2025. The transcript excerpt provided doesn't mention \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin.\" The discussion revolves around investments in Louisiana and job creation, not cryptocurrency.\n\nOther sources, like [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [11], [12], [14], [15], [16], [17], and [18], discuss Trump's crypto policies, executive orders, and other events, but none of them reference the March 24 event with the Louisiana Governor containing the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin.\" \n\nSince the event in question is specifically the March 24 remarks, and the available transcripts and summaries from that event don't include the keywords, the answer should resolve to \"No.\" There's no evidence in the provided sources that Trump used those terms during that particular event.\n</think>\n\nBased on the available search results, there is no evidence that Donald Trump used the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during his March 24, 2025 remarks with the Governor of Louisiana. The event focused on economic investments and job creation in Louisiana, with discussions about Hyundai\u2019s $130 million investment in the state[13][14]. While Trump has been actively promoting cryptocurrency policies in other contexts[1][3][6][11], the specific March 24 event did not include mentions of these terms according to the transcripts and summaries provided.\n\n**Key details:**\n- The March 24 event centered on Louisiana\u2019s economic development, with no references to cryptocurrency or Bitcoin in the available transcripts[13][14].\n- Other events, such as the March 7 White House Crypto Summit, explicitly addressed crypto/Bitcoin policies[5][6][8][12], but these were separate from the Louisiana-focused remarks.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have adhered well to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response is tasked with determining whether Donald Trump mentioned \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during a specific event on March 24, 2025, with the Governor of Louisiana. The AI's analysis is based on the search results and available transcripts from the event, which is the correct approach as per the system prompt requirements.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event in question is the one held on March 24, 2025, and it uses the appropriate sources (transcripts and video) to verify whether the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" were mentioned. The AI does not find any evidence of these terms being used during the event, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It examines the specific event's transcripts and other related sources to ensure that the terms in question were not mentioned. The response also correctly ignores other unrelated mentions of Trump's policies on cryptocurrency that do not pertain to the specific event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verifies the occurrence of the event through the provided URLs and checks the content of the event against the user's query. The recommendation of p1 (No) is based on the absence of the terms \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" in the event's transcripts and video, which is a direct and factual conclusion based on the evidence provided.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors or biases in the response. The AI strictly adheres to the event specified in the user prompt and does not extrapolate or infer from unrelated data. All sources mentioned are checked for relevance to the specific query.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided. It correctly identifies that Donald Trump did not mention \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during the specified event, and thus, the market should resolve to \"No\" as per the conditions outlined.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the system prompt instructions, uses the correct sources, and logically concludes based on the evidence provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-aligned with the requirements of the user prompt and system instructions. It correctly identifies and uses the appropriate sources to verify the event details and terms in question.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933599 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:13:19 UTC",
