The ancillary data specifies that if the Flyers win, it's p2 (Flyers), if the Stars win, p1 (Stars), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 22 is in the past. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome of the game using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [2][3][4][5][6][7] report that the Dallas Stars won the game 3-2 in overtime. For example, source [3] states, \"Thomas Harley's 2nd goal seconds into OT gives Stars a 3-2 win over the Flyers.\" Similarly, source [4] confirms the same result. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention it took place on the scheduled date. \n\nSince the Stars won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Dallas Stars occurred on March 22, 2025, as scheduled. The Dallas Stars won the game 3-2 in overtime, with defenseman Thomas Harley scoring the decisive goal nine seconds into the extra period[2][3][4][5][6][7]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was definitively determined through verified game reports and highlights. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, where a Stars victory corresponds to **p1**, the market should resolve to **p1**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"p1\" if the Stars win. The response correctly adheres to the system prompt instructions by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the game was neither postponed nor canceled.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It comprehensively addresses all possible outcomes (win by either team or cancellation) and confirms the actual outcome aligns with the conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome using multiple sources, which is a strong point in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the resolution. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"p1\" is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the Stars winning the game.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response effectively uses the information available and adheres strictly to the user prompt and system prompt instructions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets all the required criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the provided instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933615 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:13:35 UTC",
