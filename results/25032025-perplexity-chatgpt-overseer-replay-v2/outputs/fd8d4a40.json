        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Israel retaliated against the Houthis by initiating a military action between March 17 and March 21, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that \"Yes\" (p2) is the resolution if Israel took such action within that timeframe, as defined by military actions on Yemeni soil, airspace, or maritime territory, acknowledged officially or by credible reports.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any Israeli military actions against Yemen during the specified dates. Let's look through the sources provided.\n\nLooking at source [2], from December 2024, it mentions Israeli airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, this is outside the March 2025 window, so it doesn't count here.\n\nSource [5] from March 23, 2025, discusses a Houthi missile attack and mentions that the US asked Israel not to respond. It also notes previous IDF strikes on the Houthis, but the dates aren't clear. The article mentions that the IDF resumed fighting in Gaza earlier in the week (around March 23), but the specific Israeli actions in Yemen aren't within the March 17-21 window.\n\nSource [15] from March 20, 2025, reports that the Houthis fired a ballistic missile at Israel, which was intercepted. The IDF responded by intercepting the missile, but there's no mention of Israel initiating a military action on Yemeni soil during March 17-21. The article does mention that the US conducted strikes, but not Israel.\n\nSource [17] from March 19, 2025, states that the IDF prepared for potential retaliation and intercepted a missile on March 19. However, it also mentions that the IDF has a list of Houthi targets in Yemen for potential strikes, but there's no explicit confirmation of an actual strike within the specified dates.\n\nSource [18] from March 18, 2025, reports that the Houthis launched a missile at Israel, which was intercepted. The article mentions that the Houthis vowed escalation but doesn't indicate any Israeli military action in Yemen during the given timeframe.\n\nOther sources, like [1], [3], [4], [6]-[16], either discuss US actions, future threats, or events outside the March 17-21 window. For example, source [12] mentions US and UK airstrikes in March 2025 but doesn't specify Israeli involvement in those dates.\n\nCrucially, the ancillary data requires the action to be between March 17 and March 21, 2025. None of the search results explicitly state that Israel conducted a military strike on Yemeni territory within that exact timeframe. While there are mentions of Israeli interceptions of missiles and preparations, the actual retaliatory strikes by Israel on Yemeni soil, airspace, or maritime territory during those dates aren't confirmed in the provided sources. The US conducted strikes, but the query specifically asks about Israel's actions.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, there's no credible reporting confirming that Israel initiated military action against Yemen within the specified dates. The answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether Israel initiated military action against Yemen's Houthis between March 17 and March 21, 2025, per the ancillary data's resolution criteria. Analysis of the search results shows no confirmed Israeli military strikes on Yemeni soil, airspace, or maritime territory during this specific timeframe. While Israel intercepted Houthi missiles and prepared for potential retaliation, the only documented strikes in Yemen during this period were conducted by the U.S., not Israel[1][3][12]. The IDF's actions during this window focused on defensive interceptions and readiness, not offensive operations in Yemen[5][14][17].  \n\n**Key points**:  \n- **March 15\u201321 U.S. strikes**: The U.S. launched large-scale attacks on Houthi targets starting March 15[1][12], but these were American operations, not Israeli.  \n- **March 20 Houthi missile interception**: Israel intercepted a Houthi ballistic missile on March 20[15][18], but this was a defensive measure, not an offensive strike on Yemen.  \n- **No IDF strikes in Yemen during the window**: Credible reports explicitly attribute all offensive actions in Yemen during March 17\u201321 to the U.S., with no mention of Israeli military operations in Yemen[3][12][16].  \n\nSince the resolution criteria require Israeli-initiated military action within the specified dates, and no such actions are verified, the market resolves to **No**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, logical reasoning, completeness, verification of the event, and alignment of the recommendation with the facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the user prompt's requirement to verify whether Israel initiated military action against the Houthis in Yemen between March 17 and March 21, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the actions taken by Israel during this period were defensive (intercepting missiles) and not offensive actions on Yemeni soil, airspace, or maritime territory. The response does not predict or assume but relies on the evidence provided by the sources cited.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from various sources, dismissing events outside the specified timeframe and focusing on the exact requirement of the user prompt. It methodically checks each source for evidence of Israeli military action in Yemen during the specified dates and finds none. The reasoning is clear, and the response is complete as it addresses all parts of the user prompt regarding what constitutes a military action and the timeframe involved.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that no event matching the user prompt's criteria (Israeli military action in Yemen from March 17-21, 2025) occurred. It aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided, recommending a resolution of \"No\" (p1) based on the absence of verified Israeli military action in Yemen during the specified timeframe.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response uses the sources effectively and remains neutral, focusing solely on the facts required to resolve the query.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. It correctly concludes that the market should resolve to \"No\" based on the lack of evidence for Israeli military action in Yemen during the specified dates.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, adheres to the instructions, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the sources to verify the absence of the specified event and logically concludes based on the evidence provided. There is no missing information or bias, and the response is free from errors.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927078 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:24:38 UTC",
