        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the UC Santa Barbara vs. UC San Diego basketball game that was scheduled for March 14, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if UC San Diego wins, the market resolves to p1, and if UC Santa Barbara wins, it's p2. If the game is canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually took place. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 14, so the event date has passed. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game was played. For example, source [1] from UC San Diego's website mentions their 69-51 victory over UCSB on March 14. Similarly, source [9] from CBS Sports and [16] from ABC News both report the same score, with UC San Diego winning. \n\nI should verify the details to ensure there's no confusion with other games. The box score in source [6] shows UC San Diego won 69-51, and source [14] from UCSB's own site acknowledges their loss in the semifinals. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game being completed as scheduled with a clear outcome.\n\nSince UC San Diego won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no indication of any issues that would lead to a p3 resolution. All sources align, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe UC San Diego Tritons defeated the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos 69-51 in their Big West Conference Tournament semifinal game on March 14, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][6][9][14][16]. Key details from the matchup include:\n\n- **Second-half dominance**: UC San Diego erased a 27-26 halftime deficit with a decisive 18-2 run early in the second half, ultimately outscoring UCSB 43-24 after intermission[1][2][12].\n- **Statistical highlights**:  \n  - Aniwaniwa Tait-Jones led all scorers with 20 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists[9][16]  \n  - UC San Diego shot 11-12 from the free throw line in the second half[1]  \n  - UCSB managed only 6-29 field goal shooting (20.7%) in the second half[14]  \n\nThe outcome aligns with resolution condition **p1** (UC San Diego victory) as defined in the ancillary data. No evidence suggests postponement or cancellation, eliminating **p3** considerations. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924353 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:39:13 UTC"
