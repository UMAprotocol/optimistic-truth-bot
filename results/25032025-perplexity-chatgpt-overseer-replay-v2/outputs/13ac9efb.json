The ancillary data specifies that if Xavier wins, the market resolves to \"Xavier\" (p2), and if Texas wins, it's \"Texas\" (p1). If postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 19, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, several articles ([2], [3], [4], [6]) report that Xavier won the game 86-80. For example, source [2] is the official Texas Longhorns site confirming their loss, and [6] is a CBS Sports recap with the same score. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention it took place on the scheduled date. \n\nSince the event occurred and Xavier was the winner, the market should resolve to p2. There's no mention of any cancellations or postponements, so p3 isn't applicable here. All conditions are met for p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Xavier vs. Texas NCAA Tournament First Four game occurred on March 19, 2025, as scheduled. Xavier defeated Texas with a final score of **86-80**, completing a 13-point comeback[2][4][6]. Key contributions came from Marcus Foster (22 points) and Zach Freemantle (15 points), with Xavier advancing to face Illinois in the Midwest Region[4][6]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is definitively verified through multiple sources, including official team reports and major sports outlets[2][3][4][6].  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **\"Xavier\"** (p2) based on their victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the instructions by confirming the event's occurrence and outcome based on the specified date, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by checking the current date, confirming the event date, and verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It correctly concludes that Xavier won the game, which aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt for resolving the market to \"Xavier\" (p2).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, including the official Texas Longhorns site and CBS Sports. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Xavier\" (p2) is based on verified facts and directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response is focused and strictly adheres to the facts required for resolution.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
