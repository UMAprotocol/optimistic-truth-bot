        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if a market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Trump signed an executive order aiming to eliminate the Department of Education by March 31, 2025. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results. The first result from the National Law Review mentions an executive order signed on March 20, 2025, directing the closure of the Department of Education. That's within the specified timeframe. The White House fact sheet in result [2] also confirms the EO's signing on March 21, which is still within March. \n\nLooking at other sources, like the AALRR article [4] and CBS News [6], they all corroborate the signing on March 20. The Brookings analysis [7] and Chalkbeat [10] also mention the EO signed on March 20. \n\nThe key points are: the EO was signed by Trump in March 2025, and its aim is to dismantle the Department of Education. The resolution conditions state that if such an EO is signed by March 31, it's a \"Yes\". All sources confirm the EO was signed on March 20, well before the deadline. \n\nEven though some sources note that Congress needs to act to fully eliminate the department, the market's condition is about the signing of the EO, not its implementation. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\". \n\nI need to make sure there's no conflicting information. All the search results from credible sources align on the EO being signed in March 2025. No sources suggest the EO was signed outside the timeframe. \n\nSo, the recommendation is p2 (Yes).\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14112 titled \"Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities\" on March 20, 2025, which explicitly directs the Secretary of Education to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education\" and return authority to states[1][2][4][6][10]. The order meets the market's resolution criteria as it:\n\n1. **Was signed by March 31, 2025** - Executed on March 20, 2025[1][4][6][10]  \n2. **Explicitly aims to eliminate/dismantle the department** - Directs closure of the agency and transfer of authority[1][4][7][12]  \n3. **Appears in multiple authoritative sources** - Confirmed by White House documents[2], legal analyses[1][4], and major news outlets[6][10][12]\n\nWhile the order cannot fully abolish the department without congressional action[1][4][6], the market resolution depends solely on the signing of an executive order with this stated aim - which has unequivocally occurred within the specified timeframe.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742928976 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:56:16 UTC"
