        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on Bitcoin's price movement between two specific times on March 15th and 16th, 2025, using Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute close prices at noon ET each day. The resolution depends on whether the close price on the 16th is higher (Up) or lower (Down) than the 15th. If they're equal, it's a 50-50 split.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the event dates and times. The current date given is March 26, 2025, so both dates in question are in the past. That means the event has already occurred, and I need to verify the actual close prices from Binance for those specific times.\n\nThe user provided several search results, including Binance posts and data sources. Let's look through them to find the relevant close prices. \n\nLooking at the search results, result [13] and [15] mention March 16, 2025, analysis. Result [13] from March 15th discusses potential scenarios if BTC breaks through certain levels. However, it doesn't provide the exact close prices at the specified times. \n\nResult [14] from March 16th at 09:37 AM UTC states that BTC dipped below 84,000 USDT, trading at 83,988.796875 USDT. But this is a few hours after the 12:00 ET (which is 16:00 UTC) on the 16th. So this might not be the exact time needed.\n\nResult [16] from March 16th provides a detailed analysis with a current price of $82,998.82, but the time isn't specified, and it's part of a 15-minute interval chart. Not sure if this aligns with the 1-minute candle at noon ET.\n\nResult [18] gives a weekly trend from March 15-21, 2025. It lists prices for each day, but March 16th is noted at $84,231. However, this is a daily close, not the specific 1-minute candle at noon ET.\n\nThe key here is that the resolution source is explicitly the Binance BTCUSDT chart with 1-minute candles selected. The provided search results don't include the exact close prices for the 15th and 16th at 12:00 ET. Without direct access to Binance's historical data via the link, I have to rely on the information given in the search results.\n\nSince the search results don't contain the specific close prices for those exact times, and the current date is past the event, I can't definitively determine the outcome. The ancillary data defines p4 as the default if the event hasn't occurred or data is unavailable. However, since the event dates are in the past, but the necessary data isn't present in the sources, the resolution can't be verified. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4, indicating insufficient data to resolve the market.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding Bitcoin's price movement on Binance for March 15th and 16th, 2025, has been evaluated for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event dates are in the past relative to the current timestamp and acknowledges the need to verify the actual close prices from Binance for the specified times. The response adheres to the instruction to use only the specified URL (Binance) for resolution and attempts to verify the event as specified in the user prompt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the need to find specific 1-minute candle close prices at noon ET on the specified dates. It correctly concludes that without the exact data from Binance, the resolution cannot be definitively determined. The reasoning is sound, given the lack of specific data in the search results provided.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response attempts to verify the event using the information available but correctly identifies that the specific data required (exact close prices at the specified times) is not present in the search results. The recommendation of p4 (indicating insufficient data to resolve the market) aligns with the facts presented and the instructions for handling cases where the event data cannot be verified.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias or errors in processing the information. However, it lacks direct access to Binance's historical data, which is crucial for resolving the query. The response could potentially improve by suggesting a direct check on Binance's website or API if accessible, rather than relying solely on search results.\n\nGiven the critical rule that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always result in a retry, and considering that the response could potentially improve by suggesting or attempting a direct data retrieval from Binance, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"While the response logically concludes a p4 due to lack of specific data, a retry could potentially include a direct check on Binance's historical data or API to resolve the query definitively.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is logically sound and adheres to the instructions but lacks an attempt to directly retrieve the necessary data from Binance, which could potentially resolve the query.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please attempt to directly access Binance's historical data or API for the exact 1-minute candle close prices at noon ET on March 15th and 16th, 2025, to resolve the query definitively.\"\n}\n```\n\nThis decision encourages a more thorough attempt to resolve the query by accessing the most relevant and direct data source specified in the user prompt.",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price closed higher or lower between two specific times on March 15th and 16th, 2025, at noon ET, using Binance's 1-minute candles for BTCUSDT. The resolution depends on comparing those two closing prices. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any data on those specific dates and times. The search results include several Binance market analyses from March 12th, 13th, 18th, and 19th, 2025. However, none of these directly mention the closing prices for March 15th or 16th at noon ET. \n\nLooking at result [1], the analysis from March 13th mentions a current price of $83,539.50 and extreme volatility, but that's a few days before the dates in question. Result [2] and [8] (same content) from March 19th discuss the price at $82,509.61, which is after the target dates. Result [15] from March 17th talks about a price of $88,292, still not relevant to the 15th or 16th. \n\nResult [5] mentions that Binance historical data is available but notes that it's too large to provide directly. Result [10] shows code examples for retrieving historical data using APIs like easy-kline, but there's no actual data from the dates needed. Similarly, result [6] discusses a Python package for fetching Binance data but doesn't include the specific data points. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candles. Since the provided search results don't include the exact closing prices for the specified times, I can't definitively determine whether the price went up or down. The lack of direct data points means there's no verifiable information to confirm the outcome. \n\nAdditionally, the current date in the scenario is March 26, 2025, which is after the event dates. If the event had occurred, there should be historical data available. However, the absence of such data in the provided results suggests that the information isn't accessible here. \n\nTherefore, without the specific closing prices from Binance for those exact times, the recommendation has to default to p4, indicating insufficient information to resolve the query definitively.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market depends on comparing the 1-minute candle close prices for BTCUSDT on Binance at noon ET (12:00 Eastern Time) on March 15 and March 16, 2025. Based on the available data:\n\n1. **Key Timeframe Analysis**  \n   The search results contain detailed market analyses from March 12\u201319, 2025, but none explicitly report the 1-minute candle close prices for March 15\u201316 at noon ET. For example:\n   - March 13 analysis shows BTC at $83,539.50 with extreme volatility[1]  \n   - March 19 data lists BTC at $82,509.61 in a bearish trend[2][8]  \n   - March 17 analysis mentions a price surge to $88,292[15]  \n\n2. **Data Accessibility Challenges**  \n   While Binance historical 1-minute data exists[5], the provided sources don\u2019t include the specific timestamps required. Tools like `binance-historical-data`[6] and `easy-kline`[10] demonstrate methods to retrieve granular data programmatically, but no direct API calls or outputs are shown for these dates.\n\n3. **Market Context**  \n   The period shows:\n   - High volatility (24.01% daily swings)[2]  \n   - Bearish technical signals (RSI <50, declining MAs)[1][2]  \n   - Conflicting short-term bullish divergences[2][8]  \n\n4. **Resolution Constraints**  \n   Without explicit 1-minute close prices from Binance for the specified times, the outcome cannot be definitively determined from the provided sources. The ancillary data requires direct price verification from Binance\u2019s historical records, which are not included in the search results.\n\n**recommendation: p4**",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths, including a clear breakdown of the user prompt and a detailed explanation of why it cannot definitively resolve the query based on the available information. The response adheres to the instructions by focusing on the need for specific data from Binance and acknowledging the absence of this data in the search results. It also correctly identifies that the event has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp, which is crucial for the resolution process.\n\nHowever, there are critical areas where the response could be improved:\n\n1. **Data Retrieval Efforts**: The response mentions the existence of tools and methods to retrieve historical data from Binance but does not demonstrate an attempt to use these tools to obtain the specific data needed. Given the importance of direct data retrieval for resolving the query, the response should include an attempt to access Binance's API or historical data services to find the exact 1-minute candle close prices for the specified dates and times.\n\n2. **Verification and Use of Sources**: While the response correctly identifies that the provided search results do not contain the necessary data, it does not explore alternative reliable sources or methods that could potentially provide this data. The response could benefit from a more proactive approach in seeking out or verifying information through direct data sources like Binance's official trading tools or API.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically explains why it defaults to p4 due to the lack of specific data. However, it could further elaborate on potential next steps or alternative methods to obtain the required information, thus providing a more complete analysis.\n\n4. **Alignment with User Prompt Requirements**: The response aligns well with the user prompt requirements by focusing on the specified resolution conditions and the importance of direct data from Binance. However, it could improve by explicitly stating that all other potential sources or indirect references have been considered and deemed irrelevant, ensuring strict adherence to the user prompt.\n\nGiven that this is the second attempt and the response still defaults to p4 without demonstrating exhaustive efforts to retrieve the necessary data, a retry is warranted. The next attempt should focus on actively using Binance's API or any other direct data retrieval methods to obtain the exact data points required for a definitive resolution.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response needs to demonstrate a more proactive approach in retrieving the necessary data directly from Binance's API or historical data services.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response adequately explains the reasoning for defaulting to p4 but lacks an attempt to directly access the required data from Binance, which is crucial for resolving the query definitively.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please attempt to directly access Binance's API or use any available tools to retrieve the exact 1-minute candle close prices for BTCUSDT at noon ET on March 15 and March 16, 2025.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market prediction about Bitcoin's price movement between March 15 and 16, 2025, specifically looking at the 1-minute closing prices on Binance at noon ET each day. The resolution depends on whether the closing price on March 16 was higher (Up) or lower (Down) than March 15. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 26, 2025, so both March 15 and 16 are in the past. That means the event has already occurred, and I need to verify the actual closing prices from Binance for those specific times.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, there are several mentions of BTCUSDT prices around those dates. For example, result [2] from March 15 mentions a current price of 84,389.75 USDT and resistance near 84,750 USDT. Result [14], also from March 16, shows a similar price around 84,389.75 USDT and discusses support and resistance levels. However, these are general market analyses and don't specify the exact 1-minute candle closes at noon ET.\n\nResult [3] refers to a similar market resolution for March 14 and 15, but the user's query is about March 15 and 16. The ancillary data in the query specifies that the resolution must come directly from Binance's BTCUSDT 1-minute candles. The search results don't include the exact closing prices at the specified times. \n\nSome results, like [6] and [8], mention price ranges around March 15-17, but they don't provide the precise noon ET data points needed. For instance, result [6] talks about SOL prices oscillating between 132-136 on March 15-16, which isn't directly relevant to BTC. \n\nThe user also provided guidance to check Binance's API or historical data directly. However, the search results don't include any direct API responses or historical data snapshots for the exact times in question. The API changelog in result [12] discusses rate limits but doesn't provide price data.\n\nSince none of the provided sources explicitly state the closing prices at noon ET on March 15 and 16, I can't definitively determine whether the price went up or down between those two specific times. The market analyses suggest volatility and potential price movements, but without the exact data points from Binance, I can't make a conclusive resolution. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation should be p4, indicating insufficient verifiable data to resolve the market outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe market resolution depends on comparing the 1-minute candle closing prices for BTCUSDT at noon ET (16:00 UTC) on March 15 and March 16, 2025, using Binance as the resolution source. Analysis of available data shows:\n\n1. **March 15 Context**:  \n   - Price hovered around 84,376-84,750 USDT with triangular consolidation[2][14]  \n   - Resistance at 84,750 USDT identified as critical for upward momentum[2][14]  \n\n2. **March 16 Context**:  \n   - Market showed continued consolidation with price at 84,389.75 USDT[14]  \n   - Analysts projected gradual movement toward 92K-93K later in the week[13][15]  \n\n**Key Limitations**:  \n- No direct timestamped price data for the exact 12:00 ET (16:00 UTC) candles exists in available sources  \n- Search results contain general price ranges rather than 1-minute granularity[2][6][8][14]  \n- Binance API documentation updates mention rate limits but don't provide historical prices[12]  \n\nWithout access to Binance's historical 1-minute candle data through API or verified records, the exact closing prices at the specified times cannot be definitively verified through available sources.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths but also critical areas that need improvement to meet the requirements of the UMA optimistic oracle system.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event dates (March 15 and 16, 2025) are in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 26, 2025). It acknowledges the need to verify the closing prices from Binance for those specific times, which aligns with the user prompt's requirement to use Binance as the resolution source. However, the response fails to provide the exact 1-minute candle close prices at noon ET on the specified dates, which is crucial for resolving the query.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically explains why it cannot definitively resolve the market outcome due to the lack of specific data points from Binance. It mentions general market analyses and price ranges, which, while informative, do not fulfill the requirement for exact 1-minute candle close prices. The reasoning is sound based on the information available but incomplete for a definitive resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not verify the exact closing prices at the specified times, which is a key requirement for resolution. The recommendation of p4 (indicating insufficient verifiable data) is aligned with the facts presented but falls short of the directive to attempt to access Binance's API or historical data directly for a more definitive answer.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The critical missing information is the direct retrieval of the exact 1-minute candle close prices from Binance. There is no apparent bias or errors in the response, but the lack of direct data retrieval is a significant omission.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response still lacks direct data retrieval from Binance, which could potentially resolve the query definitively, a further attempt is warranted. The response needs to focus more aggressively on obtaining the exact data from Binance, either through API access or other direct means.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response fails to directly retrieve the necessary data from Binance, which is essential for resolving the query definitively.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response correctly identifies the need for specific data from Binance but does not fulfill this requirement.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742986188 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 10:49:48 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nPlease attempt to directly access Binance's historical data or API for the exact 1-minute candle close prices at noon ET on March 15th and 16th, 2025, to resolve the query definitively."
