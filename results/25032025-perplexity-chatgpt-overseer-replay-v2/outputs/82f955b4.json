The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1; Bruins win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 23 is two days ago. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [5], [7]) report that the Los Angeles Kings won the game 7-2 against the Boston Bruins. For example, source [1] states, \"Kings beat Bruins 7-2, set franchise record with 14th straight home game without regulation loss.\" Similarly, source [3] confirms the same score and outcome. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so the resolution isn't p3. \n\nAll the sources consistently report the Kings' victory, so the correct resolution should be p1 (Kings win). There's no conflicting information in the search results. The Bruins' loss is also mentioned in sources like [15], which discusses their sixth straight loss. \n\nTherefore, based on the verified outcome from multiple reliable sources, the market should resolve to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Boston Bruins and Los Angeles Kings on March 23, 2025, concluded with a **7-2 victory for the Kings** at Crypto.com Arena[1][2][3][5][7]. Multiple sources confirm the Kings dominated the game, scoring five unanswered goals after an early Bruins lead, and set a franchise record with their 14th consecutive home game without a regulation loss[1][3][7]. Key contributors included Quinton Byfield (extending his home scoring streak to seven games) and Darcy Kuemper (improving to 13-0-1 in recent home starts)[1][3]. The Bruins\u2019 sixth straight loss further diminished their playoff hopes[1][3][15]. \n\nSince the game occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled, the resolution aligns with the Kings\u2019 verified win. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Kings win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event has occurred. It then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple reliable sources, which consistently report a Kings victory. The response also correctly identifies that there was no postponement or cancellation of the game, which would have affected the resolution.\n\nThe recommendation of p1 is based on verified facts from reliable sources, and there is no indication of any missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the event in question and its verifiable outcomes.\n\nGiven the thorough verification and alignment with the user prompt and ancillary data, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple reliable sources and aligns with the ancillary data provided.

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933114 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:05:14 UTC"
