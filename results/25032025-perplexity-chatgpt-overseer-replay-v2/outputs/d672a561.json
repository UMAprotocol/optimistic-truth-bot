The ancillary data specifies that if the Wild win, it's p2; if the Stars win, p1; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, 6:11 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 24, which is the day before, so the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, sources [1], [3], and [8] all report that the Dallas Stars beat the Minnesota Wild 3-0 on March 24. For example, source [1] states, \"Stars beat the Minnesota Wild 3-0 on Monday,\" and source [8] confirms the same score. The box score in [3] also supports this result. \n\nThe user's resolution conditions state that a Stars win corresponds to p1. Since the game happened, wasn't postponed or canceled, and the Stars won, the correct resolution should be p1. There's no conflicting information in the other sources; they mainly discuss team stats, future games, or historical context, which don't affect the outcome of this specific game. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled, but all sources indicate the game took place as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution is clear: Stars won, so p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Minnesota Wild and Dallas Stars occurred on March 24, 2025, as scheduled. The Dallas Stars defeated the Minnesota Wild with a final score of 3-0[1][3][8]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Goaltending**: Stars' Jake Oettinger recorded a 32-save shutout, while Wild's Filip Gustavsson made 26 saves[1][8].\n- **Scoring**: Dallas scored two goals 58 seconds apart in the second period (Wyatt Johnston and Matt Duchene) and added an empty-net goal in the final minute[1][3].\n- **Outcome**: The Stars' victory aligns with the resolution condition specifying a Dallas win corresponds to \"p1\" (Stars)[1][3][8].\n\nNo evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in the verified sources. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (NHL game between Minnesota Wild and Dallas Stars on March 24, 2025) has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). It verifies the outcome of the game using reliable sources, which all confirm that the Dallas Stars won the game 3-0. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Stars win corresponds to \"p1\".\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event has occurred. It then proceeds to verify the outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The response also checks for any indications of the game being postponed or canceled, which there were none, thus confirming the game took place as scheduled.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome accurately. The recommendation of \"p1\" is based on the verified fact that the Dallas Stars won the game, which is in direct alignment with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions set out in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926203 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:10:03 UTC",
