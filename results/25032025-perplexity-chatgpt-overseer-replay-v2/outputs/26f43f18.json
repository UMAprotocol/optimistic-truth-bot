        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Washington Capitals vs. Los Angeles Kings game on March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Kings win, it's p1; if the Capitals win, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources like [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [15], and [16] report the game's outcome. \n\nFrom these sources, the Kings won 3-0. For example, [9] states the final score was Kings 3, Capitals 0. [10] and [11] confirm the same result, mentioning Darcy Kuemper's shutout. The Kings' official site [15] also reports their 3-0 victory. \n\nSince the game wasn't postponed or canceled, and the Kings won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. All the sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The Capitals' five-game winning streak ended here, and the Kings extended theirs to four. Ovechkin didn't score, and the Kings' defense was strong. \n\nNo conflicting information in the search results. All point to a Kings victory. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Washington Capitals and Los Angeles Kings on March 13, 2025, concluded with a **3-0 victory for the Los Angeles Kings** at Crypto.com Arena. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Quinton Byfield** extended his goal streak to five consecutive games, while **Kevin Fiala** contributed a goal and an assist[9][10][11][12][13][15].  \n- Goaltender **Darcy Kuemper** recorded a 21-save shutout, his third of the season[9][12][16].  \n- The Kings\u2019 penalty kill neutralized all five Washington power plays, including a critical 5-on-3 advantage[10][13][16].  \n- Alex Ovechkin was held without a shot on goal for only the second time this season[9][10][16].  \n\nThe Kings\u2019 win snapped the Capitals\u2019 five-game winning streak and improved Los Angeles\u2019 home record to 21-3-4[8][15]. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Kings\" (p1)**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It includes relevant details about the game, such as key players' performances and specific game statistics, which support the final score and outcome.\n\n4. **Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The recommendation of p1 (Kings win) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game. The response correctly applies the resolution conditions to this verified outcome.\n\n5. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response is thorough and uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring reliability.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742919770 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 16:22:50 UTC"
