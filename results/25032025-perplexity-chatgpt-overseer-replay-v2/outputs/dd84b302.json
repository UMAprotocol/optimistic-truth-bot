        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on whether those exact terms were used in his introductory statement or the Q&A. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of AI or Artificial Intelligence by Powell during that specific event. The key sources here are the transcripts from the press conference. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a PDF transcript of the March 19, 2025 press conference (source [4] and [10]). Let me scan through those. Source [4] includes parts of the transcript where Powell discusses economic conditions, balance sheet adjustments, and policy decisions. The excerpts provided don't mention AI or Artificial Intelligence. \n\nSource [10] is another part of the same transcript, focusing on the opening statement. Again, the content here is about economic growth, inflation, and labor market conditions. No mention of AI terms. \n\nOther sources like [8], [9], and [11] discuss Powell's past comments on AI, but those are from earlier dates (2024 and January 2025). The user's query is specifically about the March 19, 2025 event. \n\nSources [6], [12], [13], [14], [15], and [16] discuss the March 2025 meeting but focus on tariffs, inflation, and economic projections. None of these mention Powell using AI-related terms during that press conference. \n\nSince all the relevant transcripts from the March 19 event don't include the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence,\" and there's no evidence in the search results suggesting he did, the answer should resolve to \"No.\" The ancillary data specifies that any usage counts, but without any mentions found, the resolution is p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nThe Federal Reserve's March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference transcripts and related analyses show no evidence of Chair Jerome Powell using the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his introductory statement or Q&A session. The discussion focused on economic projections, inflation risks from tariffs, balance sheet adjustments, and labor market conditions[1][4][10][13][14][15]. While Powell has discussed AI's economic implications in previous years[8][9][11], these references occurred outside the March 2025 event window.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response effectively addresses the user's query regarding whether Jerome Powell mentioned \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during the March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference. The response is structured to first outline the task, then methodically search through relevant sources, and finally conclude based on the evidence found in those sources.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the instructions by focusing solely on the event specified in the user prompt. It correctly identifies that the event has occurred (given the current date is March 25, 2025) and that the resolution should be based on whether the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" were mentioned during the event. The response uses transcripts from the event as primary sources, which is appropriate and ensures accuracy.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It examines multiple sources related to the event, specifically looking for mentions of the terms in question. By confirming the absence of these terms in the transcripts of both the introductory statement and the Q&A session, the AI provides a complete analysis based on the available evidence.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI correctly verifies that the event took place on March 19, 2025, and checks the relevant transcripts for the specific terms. The recommendation aligns with the facts as no evidence was found of the terms being used by Jerome Powell during the specified event.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI focuses exclusively on the specified event and terms, as required by the prompt, and does not infer or assume information beyond the provided evidence.\n\nGiven the thoroughness of the search, the adherence to the prompt instructions, and the logical conclusion based on the evidence, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory. The recommendation of p1 (No) is well-supported by the analysis, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and completely addresses the user prompt based on the evidence from the specified event's transcripts.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933188 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:06:28 UTC",
