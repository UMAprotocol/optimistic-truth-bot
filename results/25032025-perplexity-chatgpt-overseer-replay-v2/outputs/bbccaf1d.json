The ancillary data specifies that if UCLA wins, it's p1; Utah State, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 9:25 PM ET. The current date is March 26, 2025, so the event is in the past. Now, need to verify the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [8], [10], [11]) report that UCLA defeated Utah State 72-47. For example, source [1] is UCLA's official site, which is a reliable primary source. Other sources like AP News and CBS Sports confirm the same score. \n\nUtah State's own website [6] also mentions the loss, which adds credibility. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources discuss the game happening as scheduled. There's no mention of any cancellation or postponement. \n\nSince the event occurred, and UCLA won decisively, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information found. All sources align on the outcome.\n</think>\n\nUCLA defeated Utah State 72-47 in their NCAA Tournament first-round game on March 20, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources including UCLA's official athletics website, Associated Press reports, and Utah State's own game recap[1][2][4][5][6][7][8][10][11]. The Bruins dominated with strong offensive performances from Skyy Clark and Eric Dailey Jr. (14 points each) and suffocating defense that held Utah State to 30% shooting[1][4][5]. The game was completed as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1][6][9].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
