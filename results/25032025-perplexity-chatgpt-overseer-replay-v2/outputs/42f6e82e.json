        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the Netherlands or Spain advanced to the next round of the UEFA Nations League. The ancillary data specifies that p1 is Spain, p2 is Netherlands, and p3 is 50-50 if the match is canceled or postponed beyond December 31, 2025. The resolution source is official UEFA information.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The event in question is the UEFA Nations League quarter-final between the Netherlands and Spain. The user provided several search results, so I'll go through them to find the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, especially [3], [6], [9], [11], [12], [16], and [17], they all mention that Spain defeated the Netherlands in a penalty shootout after the second leg ended 3-3, leading to a 5-5 aggregate. The penalty shootout ended 5-4 in favor of Spain. These sources are from reputable outlets like ESPN, Arab News, and the Royal Spanish Football Federation's official site, which should be considered official information as per the resolution conditions.\n\nThe match wasn't canceled or postponed; it took place on March 23, 2025, as per the dates in the search results. Since Spain advanced, according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p1 (Spain). There's no indication of any postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable here. All sources confirm Spain's victory, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nSpain advanced to the next round of the 2024\u201325 UEFA Nations League after defeating the Netherlands 5-4 in a penalty shootout following a 5-5 aggregate draw across two legs. The second leg on March 23, 2025, ended 3-3 after extra time, with decisive penalties from Pedri and a critical save by goalkeeper Unai Sim\u00f3n securing Spain\u2019s progression[3][6][9][11][12][16][17]. The match was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is confirmed by official UEFA sources and multiple verified reports. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively checks the current date and confirms that the event in question (UEFA Nations League quarter-final between the Netherlands and Spain) has occurred. It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the match using multiple reputable sources, which is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of the event resolution.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it correctly identifies the outcome of the match and aligns this with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The response specifies that Spain won the match and therefore, according to the ancillary data (p1 corresponds to Spain), the market should resolve to p1. The response also correctly notes that there was no postponement or cancellation of the match, which would have triggered a different resolution condition (p3).\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response cites multiple sources confirming Spain's victory, which matches the resolution source requirement to use official UEFA information or equivalent verified reports.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes.\n\nGiven the thoroughness and accuracy of the response, and its adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the UEFA Nations League match between the Netherlands and Spain using multiple reputable sources.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
