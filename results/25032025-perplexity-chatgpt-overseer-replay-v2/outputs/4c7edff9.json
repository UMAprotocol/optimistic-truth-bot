        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Illinois vs. Kentucky basketball game that was scheduled for March 23, 2025, at 5:15 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Kentucky wins, the market resolves to p1, Illinois to p2, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The current date provided is March 25, 2025, which is after the game's scheduled date. So the event has already occurred. Next, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]) report that Kentucky defeated Illinois with a final score of 84-75. For example, source [1] states, \"third-seeded Kentucky beat sixth-seeded Illinois 84-75,\" and source [5] mentions the same score. The game took place on March 23, 2025, as scheduled, so there's no indication of postponement or cancellation. \n\nAll sources confirm Kentucky's victory. There's no conflicting information about the result. The resolution conditions state that a Kentucky win corresponds to p1. Since the game was played and Kentucky won, the market should resolve to p1. No mentions of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nI need to ensure that the event details match exactly. The user's query specifies the correct teams and date, which aligns with the sources. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nKentucky defeated Illinois 84-75 in their NCAA Tournament second-round game on March 23, 2025, as scheduled. The Wildcats leveraged strong defensive pressure (14 forced turnovers resulting in 26 points) and efficient scoring from Koby Brea (23 points) to secure their first Sweet Sixteen appearance since 2019[1][2][5]. Illinois committed 14 turnovers and shot just 28.1% from three-point range, with key players like Will Riley (5 points) and Kasparas Jakucionis (6 turnovers) underperforming compared to their previous game[3][4][6]. Kentucky's decisive 10-0 run to start the second half extended their lead to 47-32, ultimately proving insurmountable for the Illini[4][7].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response uses multiple sources to confirm the result, ensuring that the information is reliable and verified. This aligns with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly matches the outcome with the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (Kentucky win corresponds to p1). The detailed description of the game's key moments and statistics adds to the completeness and depth of the analysis.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and that Kentucky won the game. It aligns the recommendation (p1) with the verified outcome, adhering to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or hypothetical scenarios.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory in terms of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742933678 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:14:38 UTC",
