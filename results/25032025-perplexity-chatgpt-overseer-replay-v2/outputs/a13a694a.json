        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Tennessee vs. Florida SEC Tournament game on March 16, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Florida wins, it's p1; if Tennessee wins, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 16, so the game should have already happened. Looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [7], [8], [12]) confirm that the game took place on March 16, 2025. The result was Florida winning 86-77. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no indication of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources mention the game was played as part of the SEC Tournament final, and there's no mention of any postponement or cancellation. The detailed game summaries from both teams' official sites and sports news outlets like CBS Sports and Fox Sports confirm the game was completed. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that if the game is canceled without a makeup, it resolves to p3. However, since the game was played and completed, that's not applicable here. The result was a clear Florida victory, so according to the ancillary data, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also checked the house rules from Fanatics Sportsbook ([3]) to see if there's any clause that might void the result, but the game wasn't abandoned or forfeited. The sources all confirm the game concluded normally. Therefore, the correct resolution is p1 for Florida.\n</think>\n\nThe SEC Tournament Championship game between Tennessee and Florida was played as scheduled on March 16, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. **Florida defeated Tennessee 86-77**[1][2][4][7][12], with Walter Clayton Jr. leading the Gators with 22 points and earning MVP honors[4][8]. Multiple verified sources confirm the game's completion without postponement or cancellation[1][2][4][7][12], and no evidence suggests the result was later overturned or disputed.\n\n**Key details confirming resolution:**\n- Florida led 39-30 at halftime and maintained control despite Tennessee's second-half rallies[1][4][8]\n- The Gators shot 89.3% from the free-throw line (25/28) and outrebounded Tennessee 39-25[1][8]\n- Official box scores from both universities' athletic departments validate the final score[1][4]\n\nSince the game concluded under standard competition rules with a decisive Florida victory, **the market resolves to Florida** per the ancillary data's p1 designation[1][2][4][7][12].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934991 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:36:31 UTC"
