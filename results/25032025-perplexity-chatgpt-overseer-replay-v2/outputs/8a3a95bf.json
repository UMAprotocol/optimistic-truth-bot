The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) vs. Mumbai Indians (MI) IPL match scheduled for March 23, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Mumbai winning, p2 for Chennai winning, and p3 if the game isn't completed by March 30. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 23, so the event has already occurred. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome of the match using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]) report that CSK defeated MI by 4 wickets. For example, source [1] states, \"Chennai Super Kings beat Mumbai Indians by 4 wickets,\" and source [2] mentions \"Chennai Super Kings delivered a clinical performance to kick-start their Indian Premier League 2025 campaign with a comfortable victory over Mumbai Indians.\" \n\nSince the event occurred and the result is clear, there's no need to consider the March 30 deadline. The ancillary data specifies that p2 corresponds to Chennai winning. All sources confirm CSK's victory, so the resolution should be p2. I must ensure there's no conflicting information, but all sources consistently report CSK's win. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Chennai Super Kings (CSK) defeated the Mumbai Indians (MI) by 4 wickets in their IPL 2025 opener on March 23, 2025, at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. CSK chased down MI\u2019s total of 155/9 with five balls to spare, led by Rachin Ravindra\u2019s unbeaten 65* and Ruturaj Gaikwad\u2019s 53 off 26 balls[1][2][3]. Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad starred with a four-wicket haul (4/18) to restrict MI[5][7][8], while debutant Vignesh Puthur\u2019s 3/32 briefly threatened CSK\u2019s chase[4][7].  \n\n**Key Highlights**  \n- **MI\u2019s Batting Collapse**: MI struggled against CSK\u2019s spin attack, losing wickets at regular intervals. Noor Ahmad dismantled the middle order, taking four wickets in his spell[2][5][8].  \n- **CSK\u2019s Chase**: Despite early setbacks, Gaikwad\u2019s aggressive 53 and Ravindra\u2019s composed 65* ensured victory. Ravindra sealed the win with a six in the final over[1][3][8].  \n- **Historic Streak**: MI extended their 14-season opening-match losing streak, last winning a season opener in 2012[2][6].  \n\nThe match concluded decisively before the March 30 deadline, with no indication of postponement or cancellation. Based on the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **p2** (Chennai).  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924281 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:38:01 UTC"
