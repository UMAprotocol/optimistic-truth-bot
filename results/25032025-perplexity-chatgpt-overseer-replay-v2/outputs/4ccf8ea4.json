The ancillary data specifies that if Texas Tech wins, it's p1; Drake wins, p2; postponed remains open; canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 22, so it's already happened. Now, I need to look through the search results to find out who won. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the outcome. Result [1] is from Drake's official site, stating they lost 77-64 to Texas Tech. Result [3] from Texas Tech's site confirms they won 77-64 and advanced to the Sweet 16. Result [5] from CBS Sports also reports Texas Tech's victory with the same score. Additionally, result [8] and others provide pre-game analysis, but the key info is in the post-game reports.\n\nAll these sources consistently state that Texas Tech won the game. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Texas Tech). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All post-game results align, so the answer is clear. The recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Drake vs. Texas Tech men's basketball game occurred on March 22, 2025, as scheduled. According to verified reports from both teams' official athletic websites and multiple sports media outlets, **No. 3 seed Texas Tech defeated No. 11 seed Drake 77-64** in the NCAA Tournament's second round[1][3][5]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was decisively determined by the final score.  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **p1** (Texas Tech).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909916 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:38:36 UTC"
