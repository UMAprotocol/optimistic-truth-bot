The resolution conditions are straightforward: if Michigan State wins, it's p1; Oregon, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 14) is in the past. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to confirm the result using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources report the outcome. Source [4] is the official Michigan State athletics site, which states they won 74-64. Source [5] from Oregon's site confirms the loss, mentioning the final score. ESPN's recap [8] and CBS Sports [11] also report Michigan State's victory. Additionally, source [7] from Michigan State's Rivals site and [12] from Sports Illustrated both detail the Spartans' win. \n\nAll these sources are reliable and consistent, so there's no ambiguity. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so the resolution should be p1 for Michigan State. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe game between Oregon and Michigan State took place on March 14, 2025, as scheduled. Michigan State defeated Oregon 74-64 in the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals[4][5][8][11]. Multiple sources confirm the Spartans' victory, including official team recaps[4][5], ESPN[8], and CBS Sports[11]. The game was not postponed or canceled, with Michigan State advancing to the semifinals after maintaining control through key second-half runs[7][12].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI oracle response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Oregon vs. Michigan State CBB game) occurred on March 14, 2025, and that the current date is March 25, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The response uses multiple reliable sources to verify the outcome of the game, which is that Michigan State won against Oregon with a score of 74-64. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt where a Michigan State win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm it is a past event. It then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The response also confirms that the game was neither postponed nor canceled, which matches the conditions for resolving the market as p1.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through multiple sources, including official team sites and reputable sports news outlets. The recommendation of p1 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response adequately covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the conditions provided.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified facts and the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the past event using multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses verified sources to confirm the event outcome and provides a clear, accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742918127 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 15:55:27 UTC"
