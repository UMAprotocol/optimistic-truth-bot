        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Epstein\" during his DOJ speech on March 14, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and reports from the speech. Let's look through them.\n\nSearch result [1] is from CBS News and mentions Trump's speech but doesn't reference Epstein. Similarly, [4] is a transcript of the speech from Rev.com. Scanning through the transcript excerpts, Trump talks about various topics like the Justice Department, his appointees, and criticisms of past administrations. He mentions names like Pam Bondi, Jack Smith, and others, but I don't see \"Epstein\" in the provided parts of the transcript.\n\nSearch result [10] is a YouTube video of the full remarks. The transcript excerpt there includes Trump discussing the DOJ, Biden, and other issues, but again, no mention of Epstein. The other search results, like [3], [9], and [18], discuss Trump's comments about releasing Epstein files, but those are from interviews or other events, not the March 14 DOJ speech.\n\nLooking at the resolution conditions, the key is whether \"Epstein\" was uttered during the specific DOJ appearance. The ancillary data specifies that any usage of the term, including pluralization or possessive, counts. However, none of the sources directly quoting the speech mention Trump saying \"Epstein\" during that event. \n\nSome sources, like [17], talk about the DOJ reviewing Epstein files around that time, but that's separate from Trump's speech content. The user provided a transcript of the speech in [4] and [10], and in those, there's no mention of Epstein. Therefore, based on the available evidence, Trump did not say \"Epstein\" during his DOJ appearance on March 14, 2025.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response is tasked with determining whether Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Epstein\" during his DOJ appearance on March 14, 2025. The AI correctly identifies that the event has already occurred and proceeds to analyze the content of Trump's speech using the specified sources, which include transcripts and a video of the speech.\n\nThe AI's analysis is thorough in checking multiple sources for the mention of \"Epstein\" and confirms that the term was not used during the speech. This is in line with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt, which state that the market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Trump says \"Epstein\" and to \"No\" otherwise. Since the AI found no evidence of the term being used, it correctly recommends a resolution of p1 (No).\n\nThe response is logically sound and complete, as it checks the relevant sources and directly addresses the query. The AI does not show any bias or error in its reasoning. It strictly adheres to the event specifics and the terms outlined for resolution.\n\nThere is no missing information in the response, and the AI has correctly aligned its recommendation with the facts verified from the provided sources. The decision to recommend p1 is based on concrete evidence from the speech's transcripts and video, which are reliable and directly relevant to the query.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the prompt instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzed the event using the specified sources, adhered to the resolution conditions, and provided a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively utilized the provided sources to verify the absence of the term 'Epstein' in Trump's speech, aligning perfectly with the user prompt and resolution conditions.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924011 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:33:31 UTC",
