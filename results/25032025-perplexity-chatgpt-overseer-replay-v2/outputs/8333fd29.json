The resolution conditions are p1 for Trail Blazers, p2 for Cavaliers, and p3 if canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 26, 2025, so the game was played on March 25, which is the day before. That means the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome of the game using the provided search results. Let's look through the sources. \n\nSearch result [9] from tribtoday.com states that the Cavaliers won 122-111. Similarly, [10] from spectrumnews1.com confirms the same score and outcome. Both articles mention Darius Garland leading with 27 points and the Cavaliers improving to 58-14. \n\nAdditionally, the YouTube highlights in [7] and [8] describe the Cavaliers' victory, with specific mentions of the final score and key plays. The video titles and descriptions also support that the Cavaliers won. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game having taken place as scheduled with a clear result. \n\nSince the Cavaliers won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. No conflicting information is present, and all sources agree on the outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 122-111 in their March 25, 2025 matchup, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[9][10][7]. With Donovan Mitchell sidelined due to injury, Darius Garland led Cleveland with 27 points and eight assists, supported by Ty Jerome's 25-point bench performance[9][10]. The Cavaliers dominated in paint scoring (64-42) and maintained control throughout the game despite Portland's efforts[9][10].\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled on March 25 at 10:00 PM ET with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[9][10][7][8]. As the Cavaliers won decisively, the market resolves to \"Cavaliers\" per the stated resolution conditions.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Cavaliers vs. Trail Blazers game) occurred on March 25, 2025, and that the current date is March 26, 2025, making the event a past occurrence. The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome of the game using multiple sources, which consistently report that the Cavaliers won the game. This aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with the verification of the event date, followed by a detailed examination of the game's outcome through reliable sources. The AI checks for any indications of postponement or cancellation and finds none, confirming the game took place as scheduled. The decision to resolve the market to \"Cavaliers\" (p2) is based on clear, verified information that the Cavaliers won, which matches the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, including articles and YouTube highlights, ensuring the verification process is robust. The recommendation to resolve the market as p2 is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided, where p2 corresponds to a Cavaliers win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI does not exhibit any unnecessary speculation or deviation from the facts presented in the sources.\n\nGiven the thorough verification process, adherence to the resolution conditions, and accurate reporting based on the event's outcome, the response is satisfactory and reliable for resolving the oracle request.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources, adheres to the resolution conditions, and logically presents the information without errors or bias.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively meets all requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743015753 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:02:33 UTC"
