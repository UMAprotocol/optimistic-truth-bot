The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Raptors vs. Warriors game scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Warriors win, it's p1; Raptors win, p2; postponed stays open; canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention that the original date was March 19 but was postponed to March 20 [2][7]. So the game was moved but still played on March 20. \n\nNext, looking for the game result. Search result [5] is an ESPN recap titled \"Warriors 117-114 Raptors (Mar 20, 2025) Game Recap\" which clearly states the Warriors won 117-114. The article details the game, mentioning Stephen Curry's injury but confirming the Warriors' victory. Other sources like [6] and [8] also reference the game, with [8] giving a prediction that aligns with the Warriors' win probability. \n\nI need to ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. The rescheduling was confirmed in [2] and [7], and the recap in [5] confirms it took place on March 20. No indications of cancellation. \n\nSince the game was played and the Warriors won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All sources corroborate the outcome, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden State Warriors defeated the Toronto Raptors 117-114 in their rescheduled March 20, 2025 matchup at Chase Center, as confirmed by ESPN's official game recap[5]. This outcome triggers resolution condition p1 (\"Warriors\") per the ancillary data. \n\nKey details:\n- **Game status**: Originally scheduled for March 19 but officially moved to March 20[2][7]\n- **Final score**: Warriors 117, Raptors 114[5]\n- **Key players**: Jimmy Butler recorded a triple-double (18/11/12) while Draymond Green added 21 points[5]\n- **Injury context**: Stephen Curry left with a pelvic contusion in the 4th quarter but the Warriors maintained their lead[5]\n\nThe game was completed without cancellation or additional postponement, meeting all requirements for final resolution. No 50-50 split condition applies as the contest reached official completion.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response correctly identifies the event (Raptors vs. Warriors game scheduled for March 20, 2025) and verifies that the game occurred on the rescheduled date without further postponement or cancellation. It also correctly identifies the winner of the game (Golden State Warriors) and aligns this outcome with the resolution condition p1 as specified in the ancillary data.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking the game's occurrence, confirming the rescheduled date, and verifying the final score and winner from reliable sources like ESPN. The response also ensures that the game was not postponed beyond the rescheduled date or canceled, which aligns with the conditions for resolution provided in the user prompt.\n\nThe response adheres to the system prompt instructions by focusing solely on verified facts and established outcomes without predicting or assuming results. It also correctly uses the current date and time to determine that the event has already occurred, thus avoiding an incorrect p4 recommendation.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response uses the correct sources for verification, as indicated by the references to ESPN and other sources confirming the game's outcome. The response also adheres strictly to the conditions outlined in the user prompt regarding how the market should resolve based on different outcomes.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742925290 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:54:50 UTC",
