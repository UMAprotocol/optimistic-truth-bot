The ancillary data specifies that if the Suns win, it's p1; Cavaliers win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 21) is in the past. That means I don't have to worry about it being a future event. Now, I need to verify the actual result of the game.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] mentions the Suns won 123-112, with Durant scoring 42 points. Source [2] from ESPN also states the Suns defeated the Cavaliers 123-112. Other sources like [4], [6], [12], and [14] all corroborate this result. The YouTube highlights in [3], [6], [12], and [14] also back up the Suns' victory. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports discuss the game as having taken place on March 21. The Cavaliers were on a losing streak, and the Suns secured their third straight win. Since the game was played and the Suns won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. No conflicting information found, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Phoenix Suns on March 21, 2025, concluded with the **Phoenix Suns winning 123-112**[1][2][4][6][12][14]. Kevin Durant led the Suns with 42 points, 8 assists, and 6 rebounds, while Devin Booker added 17 points and 10 assists[1][2][13]. The game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any verified sources.  \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **p1** (\"Suns\") based on their confirmed victory.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the NBA game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Phoenix Suns took place on March 21, 2025, and that the Suns won the game. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"p1\" if the Suns win. The response correctly ignores any potential for the game being postponed or canceled, as there were no indications of such events in the sources cited.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It provides a detailed account of the game's score and key performances, which supports the resolution decision. The reasoning is thorough and follows a clear, methodical approach to determine the outcome based on the event's occurrence and results.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using multiple reliable sources. It aligns the recommendation of \"p1\" directly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which stipulates this resolution if the Suns win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not introduce irrelevant information or stray from the user prompt's instructions. All information necessary for resolving the query is included, and the response is free from any factual inaccuracies.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed with the recommendation of \"p1\" is well-supported by verified facts and aligns perfectly with the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns with the ancillary data for resolution, and adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and methodical, effectively using multiple sources to confirm the event outcome and providing a clear, factual basis for the resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
