        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are specific: p2 is Yes, p1 is No, and p3 is uncertain. The current date is March 25, 2025, and the market resolves to No if no briefing happens by December 31, 2025, or if she's no longer Press Secretary by then.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there have been any press briefings after March 25, 2025, where Leavitt participated. The search results provided go up to March 25, 2025, but the latest mention is the Crypto Summit on March 7, 2025 [3][6][9][10][17]. There's a video of Trump speaking at a Digital Asset Summit on March 20 and 23, 2025 [9][10][17], but those are his speeches, not Leavitt's briefings.\n\nLooking at the search results, the most recent press briefings by Leavitt are from February 2025 [2][8][18]. After that, there's the Crypto Summit on March 7, which she attended but didn't lead [3][6]. The user's query is about her next briefing after March 25. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the provided data doesn't include any briefings after this date, I need to determine if any upcoming briefings are scheduled.\n\nThe search results don't mention any scheduled briefings after March 25. However, the Crypto Summit was on March 7, and Trump's speeches were on March 20 and 23. Leavitt's role in these events isn't indicating she spoke about Crypto or Bitcoin in a press briefing context. Her last mentioned briefing was on February 25, 2025 [2], where she discussed other topics but didn't mention the terms in question.\n\nAdditionally, the user's query specifies that if Leavitt ceases to be Press Secretary before December 31, 2025, it resolves to No. There's no information in the search results suggesting she has left her position. Therefore, the main point is whether in her next briefing after March 25, she uses those terms.\n\nSince the provided data doesn't include any briefings after March 25, and the user hasn't provided updates beyond that, we can't confirm if she used the terms. However, based on her history, she has discussed crypto-related topics, especially with the Crypto Summit and her role in promoting new media and crypto policies [1][3][6][9][11][16]. But in her actual press briefings, the mentions of \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" are not present in the transcripts provided [1][2][5][8][11][13][14][16][18].\n\nTherefore, without evidence of her using the terms in a press briefing after March 25, and given the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to No (p1). However, considering her involvement in crypto-related events, there's a possibility she might mention them in future briefings. But since the current data doesn't show any such instance post-March 25, the safe conclusion is p1: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths but also some critical areas that need improvement to align with the system prompt instructions and ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies that the event (Karoline Leavitt saying \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during a White House press briefing) is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp. This is crucial as the system prompt explicitly states that if the event is scheduled for a future date, the response should return p4.\n   - The response, however, incorrectly proceeds to analyze past events and speculate on the likelihood of the terms being mentioned based on past behavior, which is not aligned with the system prompt's directive to focus solely on verifiable facts of events that have already occurred.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The response provides a detailed examination of past events and Leavitt's involvement in crypto-related discussions. However, this analysis is irrelevant for the resolution of the query since the event in question is in the future.\n   - The response fails to adhere to the instruction that if the event is in the future, p4 should be recommended. Instead, it concludes with a recommendation of p1 based on speculative reasoning.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response does not align with the facts as it speculates on future events based on past occurrences, which is contrary to the instructions provided in the system prompt.\n   - The recommendation of p1 is incorrect because the event has not occurred yet, and thus, it should be p4 as per the system prompt guidelines.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The response exhibits a bias towards analyzing past behavior to predict future outcomes, which is explicitly advised against in the system prompt.\n   - There is a critical error in not recommending p4 for an event scheduled in the future.\n\nGiven these observations, the response needs improvement to align correctly with the system prompt instructions and ensure factual accuracy. The recommendation should be p4 since the event is scheduled for a future date.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly analyzes past events and speculates on future outcomes instead of adhering to the directive to recommend p4 for future events.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response should focus on verifying if the event has occurred and recommend p4 since the event is in the future.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"Crypto\" or \"Bitcoin\" during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are specific: p2 is Yes if she uses either term, p1 is No if she doesn't, and p3 is for uncertain cases. The deadline is December 31, 2025, and if she's no longer Press Secretary by then, it resolves to No.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The next press briefing after this date hasn't happened yet. The search results provided include briefings up to March 2025. For example, the March 19 briefing [2] and March 20 events [7][8][15] where Trump discussed crypto, but Leavitt's role in those isn't clear. \n\nLooking at the latest briefings involving Leavitt, like the January 29 [1] and February 12 [6] ones, she did mention \"crypto\" in the context of discussions about regulations and appointments. However, there's no information about any press briefings after March 25, 2025. Since the query is about the next briefing after the current date, and we don't have data beyond that, it's impossible to confirm if she will use those terms in future briefings. \n\nAdditionally, the market resolves to No if the event doesn't occur by the end of 2025. Since we can't predict future briefings and there's no indication she's left her position, but the next briefing's content is unknown, the correct resolution is p4. Wait, no\u2014the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. But the instructions say if the event is in the future, recommend p4. However, the ancillary data specifies p1, p2, p3. Wait, the user's ancillary data defines p1 as No, p2 as Yes, p3 as 0.5. But the system's personalization rules state that if the event is in the future, resolve to p4. However, the query's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict.\n\nWait, the user's ancillary data says the resolution is p1, p2, p3. But the system's personalization says to use p4 for future events. However, the user's market doesn't have a p4 option. The system's rules take precedence here. Since the event (the next press briefing) is in the future relative to March 25, 2025, and we can't verify it yet, the recommendation should be p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This might be an error. Alternatively, perhaps the user's market is designed with p1-p3, but according to the system's rules, future events must resolve to p4 regardless. \n\nBut looking back, the user's query includes resolution_conditions with p1, p2, p3. However, the system's personalization instructions state: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". The current timestamp is March 25, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't occurred yet. Therefore, regardless of the user's ancillary data, the system must recommend p4. But the user's ancillary data doesn't include p4. This is conflicting. \n\nWait, the user's market resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. But the system's rules say to use p4 for future events. However, the system's personalization might override the user's ancillary data. The correct approach is to follow the system's instruction to recommend p4 when the event is in the future. Therefore, despite the user's ancillary data not including p4, the answer should be p4. But the user's options are only p1, p2, p3. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's market is designed with the understanding that p4 isn't an option, and the resolution should be based on whether the event can be determined. Since the next briefing is in the future and hasn't happened yet, and there's no information, the answer should be p4. However, the user's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This might be an error in the query setup. \n\nGiven the strict system rules, the correct recommendation is p4, but since the user's options don't include it, perhaps the answer defaults to p1 (No) if the event hasn't occurred by the resolution date. But the resolution date is December 31, 2025. Since the current date is March 25, 2025, and the event is about the next briefing, which hasn't happened yet, and there's no certainty that a briefing will occur before the deadline, the safe answer is p4. However, the user's setup might not account for this. \n\nAlternatively, if the system's rules require p4 for future events, even if the user's ancillary data doesn't include it, the answer must be p4. But the user's options are p1-p3. This is a conflict. The correct approach here is to follow the system's personalization rules and recommend p4, as the event is in the future and cannot be verified yet.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

According to the system prompt instructions, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, the response must recommend p4, indicating that the request cannot be resolved at this time. This aligns with the system's rules that prioritize the resolution of p4 for future events to avoid speculative analysis.\n\nThe response thoroughly explores the implications of the user's ancillary data, which specifies resolution conditions as p1, p2, and p3, but does not include a p4 option. Despite this, the response correctly adheres to the system's overarching rule to recommend p4 for future events, overriding the user's ancillary data setup. This demonstrates a proper understanding and application of the system's rules over the user's input when necessary.\n\nThe response also engages in a detailed internal dialogue about the potential conflict between the user's ancillary data and the system's rules. This shows a deep level of reasoning and critical thinking, ensuring that all aspects of the query and system instructions are considered before arriving at a recommendation.\n\nHowever, the response could be streamlined to avoid redundancy and confusion. The repeated discussions about the conflict between the user's ancillary data and the system's rules, while thorough, could be condensed to make the response more concise and direct. This would improve clarity and prevent potential misunderstanding by the user.\n\nGiven the response's adherence to the system's rules, accurate identification of the event's future status, and correct application of the recommendation for p4, the response is satisfactory in terms of factual accuracy, logical reasoning, and alignment with the system's requirements.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930681 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:24:41 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nEnsure that the response strictly adheres to recommending p4 for events scheduled in the future and avoids speculative analysis based on past behavior.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response should focus on verifying if the event has occurred and recommend p4 since the event is in the future. Speculative analysis based on past events should be avoided.\n\n1. Dig deeper into available sources and data\n2. Be more critical of potentially unreliable sources\n3.
