The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Jacksonville State vs. Liberty basketball game scheduled for March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Liberty wins, it resolves to p1 (Liberty), if Jacksonville State wins, p2 (Jacksonville State), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred on March 15, 2025. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources mention the game. For example, source [1] shows the final score as Liberty 79, Jacksonville State 67. Source [9] and [11] both confirm that Liberty won 79-67 in the CUSA Championship game on March 15. Additionally, source [12] and [13] from Liberty's official site and a news article also state Liberty's victory. \n\nI need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources refer to the game taking place as scheduled, with detailed stats and player performances. There's no indication of cancellation or postponement. Therefore, the resolution should be based on the actual outcome. Since Liberty won, the market resolves to p1.\n</think>\n\nLiberty defeated Jacksonville State 79-67 in the Conference USA Championship game on March 15, 2025, securing their first CUSA tournament title[1][9][12][13]. The game was played as scheduled without postponement or cancellation, with Liberty leading by as many as 20 points in the second half behind Kaden Metheny's 21 points and Taelon Peter's perfect 7-of-7 shooting performance[9][12]. \n\nGiven the confirmed outcome and no evidence of cancellation, the market resolves to **Liberty**.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742906815 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:46:55 UTC"
