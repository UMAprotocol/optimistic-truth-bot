        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of the Colorado State vs. Memphis NCAA Tournament game that took place on March 21, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Colorado State wins, the market resolves to \"Colorado State\" (p2), and if Memphis wins, it resolves to \"Memphis\" (p1). If the game is postponed or canceled, there are other conditions, but I need to check if the game actually happened as scheduled.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the date and time of the game. The query mentions the game was scheduled for March 21 at 2:00 PM ET. The current date provided is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date, so the event has already occurred. Now, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]) all report that Colorado State defeated Memphis with a score of 78-70. For example, source [1] states that Memphis fell to Colorado State 78-70 in the first round. Source [2] mentions Kyan Evans leading Colorado State to a 78-70 victory. Similarly, sources [3] through [8] all confirm the same result. \n\nAdditionally, there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All reports discuss the game as having taken place on March 21, with detailed recaps and player statistics. The game was played as scheduled, and Colorado State emerged as the winner. \n\nSince the game was completed and Colorado State won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Colorado State). There's no ambiguity here; all sources agree on the outcome, and the game wasn't postponed or canceled. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA Tournament game between Colorado State and Memphis occurred as scheduled on March 21, 2025, at 2:00 PM ET. **Colorado State defeated Memphis 78-70**[1][2][3][4][5][6], advancing to the second round of the tournament. Key factors in the outcome included Kyan Evans\u2019 career-high 23 points (including six three-pointers)[2][4][6] and Memphis\u2019 absence of injured guard Tyrese Hunter[2][3][5]. The Rams\u2019 11-game winning streak and strong second-half performance secured the victory[2][3][6], while Memphis struggled with turnovers and inconsistent shooting[6][8].  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **Colorado State** (p2).  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively verifies the event's occurrence and aligns the recommendation with the facts provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Colorado State vs. Memphis game occurred on March 21, 2025, and that Colorado State won with a score of 78-70. This outcome matches the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"Colorado State\" (p2). The response does not predict or assume but relies on verified facts from multiple sources confirming the game's result.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response methodically checks the date and confirms the game has occurred. It then verifies the outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable and consistent. The response also correctly ignores any conditions about postponement or cancellation, as these did not occur.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event against the scheduled date and confirms the outcome using multiple sources. It aligns the recommendation (p2) directly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies p2 for a Colorado State win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is focused solely on the event in question and uses a sufficient number of sources to confirm the outcome, which aligns with the best practices for factual verification.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 (Colorado State) is based on verified and consistent information, making it reliable for practical use.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions without any factual errors or logical inconsistencies.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event outcome and provides a clear, well-reasoned recommendation based on the user prompt's conditions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742931184 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:33:04 UTC"
