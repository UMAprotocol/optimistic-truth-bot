The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Middle Tennessee vs. Jacksonville State CBB game on March 14, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Jacksonville State wins, it's p1; Middle Tennessee is p2; postponed stays open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 14 is definitely in the past. No need to worry about future dates here.\n\nNext, I need to verify the actual outcome of the game. Let's look through the search results. \n\nLooking at result [6], it's an AP recap titled \"House and Jacksonville State defeat Middle Tennessee 70-68 in Conference USA Tournament semifinals.\" The article clearly states that Jacksonville State won 70-68. That's a direct source confirming the result. \n\nResult [2] from the Middle Tennessee athletics site also mentions they lost 70-68 to Jax State in the CUSA semifinal. Result [5] from Fox Sports lists the box score with Jacksonville State covering the spread, which aligns with their win. Result [9] from Dimers had a prediction that matched the actual score of 70-68 for Jacksonville State. \n\nThere's also result [1] from January 11, 2025, where Middle Tennessee won, but that's a different game. The March 14 game is the one in question here. \n\nAll the relevant sources point to Jacksonville State winning the March 14 game. No sources indicate a postponement or cancellation. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Jacksonville State). \n\nI need to make sure there's no conflicting information. The other results either discuss different games (like the January matchup or football predictions) or are predictions before the game. The actual game results from reputable sources like AP and the team's official site confirm the outcome. \n\nSo, the final answer is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders and Jacksonville State Gamecocks faced off in the Conference USA Tournament semifinals on March 14, 2025. According to verified game recaps and box scores, **Jacksonville State defeated Middle Tennessee 70-68**[6][2]. Freshman Quel'Ron House led the Gamecocks with 20 points, including decisive free throws in the final seconds, securing their advancement to the championship game[6]. This outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided, where a Jacksonville State win corresponds to **p1**.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response demonstrates a thorough verification process by checking multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the Middle Tennessee vs. Jacksonville State CBB game, which took place on March 14, 2025. The AI correctly identifies that the game has already occurred and is not a future event, aligning with the requirement to check the event date relative to the current timestamp.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically verifies the game's outcome through various reputable sources, including AP recaps and the official athletics site of Middle Tennessee. The AI dismisses irrelevant results, such as a different game that occurred on January 11, 2025, ensuring that the resolution is based strictly on the specified event. This demonstrates adherence to the instruction to resolve based on the specific event mentioned in the user prompt and to disregard similar but unrelated events.\n\nThe recommendation of \"p1\" for a Jacksonville State win is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Jacksonville State win. The response is complete, with no missing information, bias, or errors detected. The AI effectively uses the sources to confirm the game's outcome without relying on predictions or unrelated data, which satisfies the requirement for resolution based on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\nOverall, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The decision to proceed with the recommendation of \"p1\" is justified based on the verified outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event using multiple reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
