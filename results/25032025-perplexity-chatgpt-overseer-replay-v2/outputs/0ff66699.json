The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for transcripts or mentions of Powell's opening statement. Looking at the sources, several of them are related to the FOMC meeting. \n\nSearch result [1] includes a transcript snippet where Powell starts with \"Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused...\" This is from March 19, 2025, which matches the event date. \n\nSearch result [2] is a PDF transcript of Powell's opening statement on March 19, 2025. The first line is \"CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused...\" This clearly shows he used the exact phrase.\n\nSearch result [4] and [6] also reference the same event. The PDF in [6] has the opening statement starting with \"CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon.\" which is a direct match. \n\nOther sources like [3], [5], [7], and [8] are unrelated, discussing different people named Powell or other events, so they can be ignored. \n\nThe key here is verifying the exact phrase in the correct event's transcript. Both [1], [2], and [6] confirm that Powell did say \"Good afternoon\" at the beginning of his statement. Since the resolution conditions state that any usage, including possessive or plural forms, counts, and the exact term was used, the answer should be Yes (p2). There's no ambiguity here as multiple sources corroborate the phrase was used.\n</think>\n\nJerome Powell did say \"Good afternoon\" during his March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference. Multiple transcripts of the event show he opened his remarks with the phrase \"Good afternoon\" in both his prepared statement[1][2][6] and subsequent Q&A session[2]. This meets the resolution criteria requiring verbatim usage of the term regardless of context.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's official transcript[6] and third-party media reports[1][4] all confirm the exact phrase was used at 2:00 PM ET on March 19, 2025, within the specified event timeframe. No alternative forms or compound words were involved - only the direct match specified in the resolution conditions.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The AI has confirmed through multiple sources that Powell did indeed say \"Good Afternoon,\" which directly aligns with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks multiple sources to confirm the exact phrase used by Powell, ensuring that the resolution is based on concrete evidence. The response also correctly ignores irrelevant sources, focusing only on those that pertain to the specific event and statement in question.\n\nThe recommendation of p2 (Yes) is well-supported by the evidence provided in the response, which includes direct quotes from the transcripts that match the user's query. The AI has also correctly identified that the event has already occurred and that the information is available, thus not defaulting to p4, which is used when an event cannot be resolved at the time.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has adhered strictly to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, including the specific terms required for resolution and the exact setting of the event.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
