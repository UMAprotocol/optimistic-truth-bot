The ancillary data specifies that if Utah State wins, it's p1; if UNLV wins, p2; if postponed, wait; if canceled, 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 13, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 25, 2025. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([2], [3], [4], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]) report that Utah State defeated UNLV 70-58 in the Mountain West Tournament quarterfinals on March 13. For example, source [8] from CBS Sports states the final score as 70-58 in favor of Utah State. Similarly, source [10] from ESPN confirms the same score and outcome. \n\nAll the recent articles from March 14th and 13th, 2025, consistently report Utah State's victory. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. The earlier result from January 16th (source [1]) where UNLV won is irrelevant here since the query is about the March 13th game. \n\nSince the event occurred, the outcome is clear: Utah State won. Therefore, the market should resolve to p1. No conflicting information or uncertainties are present in the sources. The resolution conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe UNLV vs. Utah State men's basketball game scheduled for **March 13, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET** concluded with **Utah State defeating UNLV 70-58** in the Mountain West Tournament quarterfinals[2][3][8][9][10][11][12]. The Aggies led for 36:57 of game time, holding UNLV to 23.6% shooting from the field[3][10]. Key contributors included Ian Martinez (17 points) and Mason Falslev (15 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists)[8][10], while UNLV\u2019s shorthanded roster saw Jaden Henley score a game-high 19 points[2][4].  \n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and the final result was verified across multiple sources, including ESPN, CBS Sports, and the Associated Press[8][10][11].  \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Verification of Event**: The response accurately reports the outcome of the UNLV vs. Utah State game held on March 13, 2025, stating that Utah State won with a score of 70-58. This outcome is supported by multiple reliable sources such as CBS Sports and ESPN, which are mentioned in the response. The response correctly identifies that the game was not postponed or canceled.\n\n2. **Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres strictly to the system prompt instructions. It correctly identifies that the event has already occurred (past the date of the game relative to the current timestamp) and verifies the outcome based on reliable sources. It does not attempt to predict or assume outcomes without evidence, adhering to the requirement to base the resolution on concrete evidence and established facts.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the verified sources to conclude that Utah State won. It provides a detailed account of the game, including significant performances by players, which supports the final score and outcome. The response is thorough and leaves no relevant details unaddressed.\n\n4. **Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The recommendation of `p1` aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where `p1` corresponds to a Utah State win. The response ensures that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n5. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no missing critical pieces of information, apparent bias, or errors in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question without bringing in irrelevant data or personal assumptions.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the provided instructions. The decision to proceed is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately reports the outcome of the event based on reliable sources, adheres to the instructions, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, factually accurate, and complete.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742923868 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:31:08 UTC"
