        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking. They want to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for a college basketball game between VCU and BYU scheduled for March 20 at 4:05 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies how the market should resolve based on the game's outcome. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the game's scheduled date. \n\nThe key points here are determining whether the game happened as planned, was postponed, or canceled. Since the current date is past March 20, I need to check if the game took place and what the result was. The resolution conditions are p1 for BYU winning, p2 for VCU, and p3 if it's canceled. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mention of BYU defeating VCU 86-60 in the NIT first round. The date of the game matches the one in the query, March 20. The score clearly indicates BYU won. Since the game was played and not postponed or canceled, the market should resolve based on the outcome. According to the ancillary data, a BYU win corresponds to p1. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The source provided is from The Salt Lake Tribune, which seems reliable. No other sources mention a postponement or cancellation, so it's safe to conclude the game occurred as scheduled. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between VCU and BYU scheduled for March 20, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET occurred as planned. According to verified results, **BYU defeated VCU 86-60** in the NIT first-round matchup[1]. Since the game was completed and BYU won, the market resolves to \"BYU\" per the ancillary data terms. There is no indication of postponement or cancellation in the available information.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927221 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:27:01 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.
