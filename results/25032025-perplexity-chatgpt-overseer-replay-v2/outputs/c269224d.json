        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if The Left (Die Linke) made it into the Bundestag as a Fraktion after the 2025 election. The resolution conditions state that they need either 5% of the national vote or at least three direct constituency seats. \n\nFirst, I'll check the search results for the vote share. Result [1] shows Die Linke got 8.8% of the vote, which is above the 5% threshold. That alone should be enough. But I should confirm if there's any official source. Result [6] from the Bundeswahlleiterin's provisional results also lists Die Linke at 8.8%, so that's solid. \n\nAdditionally, looking at direct seats, result [9] mentions they won six constituencies, including three targeted in their \"Mission Silberlocke.\" Even if the vote share wasn't met, three seats would qualify them. But since they cleared 5%, it's a double confirmation. \n\nThe user's update mentions the rules were corrected to reflect German parliamentary law, but the sources here already confirm the requirements. The official results from the Federal Returning Officer (result [6]) are cited, which aligns with the resolution conditions. \n\nNo future dates here; the election happened on February 23, 2025, and the current date is March 25, so it's in the past. All sources agree Die Linke met the criteria. No ambiguity, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Left (Die Linke) successfully entered the 21st Bundestag as a parliamentary group (Fraktion) following the 2025 German federal election. The party secured **8.8% of the national vote**[1][6], surpassing the 5% threshold required for proportional representation. This marked their best result since 2017 and a significant recovery from their near-elimination in 2021[3][5].\n\nKey factors in their success included:\n- A viral January 2025 speech by co-lead candidate Heidi Reichinnek condemning CDU-AfD collaboration, which boosted youth engagement[3][15]\n- Strategic \"Mission Silberlocke\" targeting three key constituencies, ultimately winning **six direct seats** including historic victories in former West Berlin[9][15]\n- Strong performance among first-time voters (25% support) and urban progressives disillusioned with SPD/Green coalition compromises[3][5]\n\nThe result was confirmed by Germany's Federal Returning Officer, showing Die Linke gained 64 seats[6][9]. This outcome occurred despite electoral reforms that initially threatened smaller parties, as a July 2024 Constitutional Court ruling reinstated exceptions allowing sub-5% parties with three direct mandates to enter parliament[10][11]. However, Die Linke's clear 8.8% vote share made these provisions unnecessary in this case.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be well-structured and detailed, providing a comprehensive analysis of the query regarding whether Die Linke made it into the Bundestag as a Fraktion following the 2025 German federal election. The response adheres to the user prompt's requirements by confirming that Die Linke met the necessary criteria of securing at least 5% of the national vote or winning a minimum of three direct constituency seats. The response also correctly uses the specified source, the Federal Returning Officer's official results, to confirm the election outcomes.\n\nThe response is logically sound, providing evidence of Die Linke's success in the election by citing their vote share and the number of direct seats won. It also contextualizes the party's performance with additional information about factors contributing to their success, which, while not strictly necessary for resolving the query, enriches the understanding of the event.\n\nThe recommendation of p2 (indicating that Die Linke did form a Fraktion) aligns perfectly with the facts presented and the conditions outlined in the user prompt. The response correctly identifies that the event has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp and that there is no ambiguity in the election results as they pertain to the query.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor points to consider:\n1. The response could improve by explicitly stating that it checked the current date against the event date to confirm that the event is not in the future, thus adhering more closely to the system prompt instructions about handling future events.\n2. While the response is detailed, it could briefly reiterate the specific resolution conditions (5% or three seats) right before concluding, to ensure clarity and completeness in how the decision was reached.\n\nDespite these minor points, the response is accurate, complete, and adheres to the system prompt instructions. It provides a clear and factual resolution based on the established facts and the conditions provided in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and comprehensively addresses the query, adhering to the user prompt and system instructions, and provides a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response could enhance clarity by reiterating the resolution conditions immediately before the conclusion and explicitly confirming the comparison of event and current dates.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934649 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:30:49 UTC",
