The ancillary data specifies that if the Canadiens win, it's p1; Senators win is p2; postponed or canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game in question (March 18) has already happened. That means I don't have to worry about future events. Now, I need to confirm the result of that game using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, all sources [1][2][4][5][6][7][8] consistently report that the Montreal Canadiens won the game 6-3 against the Ottawa Senators. For example, source [1] states, \"Nick Suzuki\u2019s power-play goal late in the third period lifted the Montreal Canadiens over Ottawa 6-3 on Tuesday night,\" and source [4] mentions, \"Montreal Canadiens ended the Ottawa Senators' six-game winning streak with a 6-3 victory.\" \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources confirm the game took place as scheduled, and the Canadiens were the victors. Since the Canadiens won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI also need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All the search results align on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. The ancillary data's conditions are clear, and the result meets the criteria for p1. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens defeated the Ottawa Senators 6-3 in their NHL game on March 18, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][4][5][6][8]. The Canadiens overcame third-period deficits of 2-1 and 3-2, with Nick Suzuki scoring the decisive power-play goal at 15:23 of the third period[1][4][6]. This outcome ended Ottawa's six-game winning streak and improved Montreal's record in the season series to 3-0 against the Senators[2][6].\n\nGiven the resolution conditions where p1 corresponds to a Canadiens victory, the market should resolve accordingly based on this verified outcome.\n\nrecommendation: p1",

It uses multiple sources to confirm that the Montreal Canadiens won the game, which is consistent with the user prompt's resolution condition for a Canadiens win (p1).\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a detailed account of the game, including the final score and key events such as Nick Suzuki's power-play goal. It confirms that the game was not postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions outlined for resolution. The logical flow from the event's occurrence to the recommendation is clear and well-supported by the cited sources.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks for any discrepancies or conflicting information regarding the outcome. The alignment of the recommendation (p1 for a Canadiens win) with the verified facts is accurate.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, bias, or missing information in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and the conditions set in the user prompt without adding unnecessary details or assumptions.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of the event's outcome and the correct application of the resolution conditions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the NHL game and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742910067 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:41:07 UTC",
