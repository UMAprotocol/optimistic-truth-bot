The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the UT Arlington vs. Grand Canyon CBB game scheduled for March 12 at 11:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Grand Canyon wins, it's p1; if UT Arlington wins, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 12, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [3] from ESPN shows the final score as Grand Canyon 98-75 UT Arlington on March 12, 2025. Another source [4] from the Grand Canyon athletics site confirms the same score, stating GCU won 98-75 in the WAC quarterfinal. Additionally, [6] and [8] also report the 98-75 victory for Grand Canyon. \n\nThe user's resolution conditions state that a Grand Canyon win resolves to p1. All the sources agree that Grand Canyon won decisively. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe CBB game between UT Arlington and Grand Canyon scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 11:30 PM ET concluded with **Grand Canyon defeating UT Arlington 98-75** [3][4][6][8]. The game was part of the WAC Tournament quarterfinals, with Grand Canyon advancing to the semifinals. Key stats include:\n\n- **Grand Canyon's JaKobe Coles** scoring 24 points on 9-15 shooting [6][8].\n- The Lopes shot 54% from the field and recorded 24 assists [4].\n- UT Arlington\u2019s Brandyn Talbot and Raysean Seamster each scored 15 points [6][8].\n\nThe final score confirms **Grand Canyon covered the spread** (winning by 23 points, exceeding the 8.5-point spread) and the total points (173) surpassed the over/under of 148.5 [7][8]. No evidence suggests postponement or cancellation. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response effectively verifies the outcome of the UT Arlington vs. Grand Canyon CBB game, which took place on March 12, 2025, and confirms that Grand Canyon won the game with a score of 98-75. This outcome aligns with the user's ancillary data, where a Grand Canyon win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response is logically sound and thorough in its verification process. It cites multiple sources (ESPN, Grand Canyon athletics site, and others) that confirm the game's outcome, ensuring that the information is reliable and not based on a single source. The response also correctly identifies that there is no evidence of the game being postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions set in the user prompt for resolving the market.\n\nFurthermore, the response adheres strictly to the instructions by focusing solely on verified facts about the event that has already occurred. It does not speculate or predict outcomes but rather reports on the definitive result of the game. The response also aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, ensuring that the resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not stray from the event specified in the user prompt and uses the correct sources for resolution. It also provides additional context about the game, such as key players and statistics, which, while not necessary for the resolution, enrich the response without affecting its accuracy.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
