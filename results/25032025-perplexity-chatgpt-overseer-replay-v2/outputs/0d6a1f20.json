        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request based on the outcome of the Mt. St. Mary's vs. Iona basketball game that was scheduled for March 15, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Mt. St. Mary's wins, the market resolves to p2, and if Iona wins, it's p1. If the game is postponed, the market stays open, and if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after March 15, so the event should have already taken place. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game was played on March 15. For example, source [1] from CBS Sports reports the game result with a final score of 63-49 in favor of Mt. St. Mary's. Similarly, source [2] from the MAAC official site and [3] from TheScore.com also confirm the same outcome. \n\nNext, I need to verify the result. The AP article in source [1] states that Mt. St. Mary's won the MAAC Championship by defeating Iona 63-49. Key players like Dallas Hobbs and Dola Adebayo are mentioned, and the game's progression is detailed, including the halftime score and second-half performance. Other sources like [11] from Fox Sports and [14] from SFGate also report the same score and outcome. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the search results. All sources indicate the game was played as scheduled. Therefore, the resolution conditions are met for a Mt. St. Mary's victory, which corresponds to p2 according to the ancillary data. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all sources consistently report Mt. St. Mary's as the winner. The final step is to ensure that the event in question is the same as the one described. The user's query specifies the March 15 game, which aligns with all the search results provided. \n\nSince the event occurred, the outcome is clear, and there's no ambiguity, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nThe March 15, 2025 MAAC Championship game between Mt. St. Mary's and Iona concluded with **Mt. St. Mary's defeating Iona 63-49** to claim their first conference title[1][2][3][11][14]. Multiple verified sources including CBS Sports, MAAC's official website, and Fox Sports confirm the outcome occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][2][11].\n\nKey details:\n- Final score: **Mt. St. Mary's 63** | **Iona 49**[1][3][11]\n- Mt. St. Mary's secured the lead permanently in the second half with a 20-8 closing run[1][14]\n- Dallas Hobbs led the Mountaineers with 18 points and 7 assists[1][14]\n- The game was played at Jim Whelan Boardwalk Hall as planned[9][13]\n\nSince the event occurred on schedule and Mt. St. Mary's won decisively, the market resolves to **p2** per the ancillary conditions. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
