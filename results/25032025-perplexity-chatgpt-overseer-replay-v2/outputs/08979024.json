The ancillary data specifies that if Memphis wins, it's p1; UAB wins, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game has already happened. Checking the search results, multiple sources like [1], [4], [6], [9], [10], [11], and [13] all report that Memphis won the game 84-72. The game was part of the AAC Championship, and Memphis was the regular-season champion. \n\nI should verify that the game in question is the same as the one in the sources. The date matches (March 16), and the teams are UAB and Memphis. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation; all sources indicate the game was played. Therefore, the result is clear: Memphis won. \n\nSince the resolution conditions state a Memphis win corresponds to p1, the recommendation should be p1. No conflicting information found in the sources, so no need to consider p3 or p2.\n</think>\n\nThe UAB vs. Memphis men's basketball game scheduled for March 16, 2025, at 3:00 PM ET was played as planned, with **No. 16 Memphis defeating UAB 84-72** in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) Championship final[1][4][6][9][10][11][13]. Key details:\n\n- Memphis secured its first AAC regular-season and tournament title double, led by PJ Haggerty (23 points) and Dain Dainja (22 points, 12 rebounds)[4][6][13].\n- UAB\u2019s Yaxel Lendeborg recorded a 19-point, 17-rebound double-double but struggled with fatigue after three consecutive tournament games[1][6][11].\n- The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required[1][4][9][11].\n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **Memphis (p1)** based on their confirmed victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
