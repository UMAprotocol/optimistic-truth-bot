        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the Israel-Hamas ceasefire was canceled before April 2025, specifically by March 31. The resolution depends on official announcements or credible reports confirming the ceasefire's end by that date.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any official statements from Israel or Hamas about canceling the ceasefire. Looking at the sources:\n\n- Source [2] from March 17 mentions that the IDF launched strikes after Hamas refused hostage deals. The PM's office stated they're attacking Hamas targets, indicating a resumption of military action.\n- Source [6] on March 17 says airstrikes ended the fragile ceasefire, with Sky News reporting the IDF's extensive strikes.\n- Source [11] from March 17 explicitly states the ceasefire ended as Israeli bombs struck Gaza, with Israeli leaders announcing the end due to Hamas's refusal of proposals.\n- Source [14] from March 19 notes a new ground operation, with Hamas calling it a violation of the ceasefire agreement.\n- The update provided mentions the IDF's official announcement of extensive strikes on March 17, which the user says qualifies the market to resolve as \"Yes\".\n\nMultiple sources confirm that Israel resumed military operations on March 17, effectively ending the ceasefire. Both IDF announcements and credible news outlets like Sky News and CBS News report this. Hamas also acknowledged the ceasefire's end in their statements. Since the cutoff is March 31, and the events happened in mid-March, the answer is \"Yes\". The resolution conditions point to p2 for Yes, so the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Israel-Hamas ceasefire was officially canceled on March 17, 2025, when Israel resumed military operations in Gaza after Hamas rejected proposals to extend the truce. The IDF launched extensive airstrikes and ground operations, ending the two-month ceasefire that began in January 2025[2][6][11][14]. Key developments:\n\n## Ceasefire Termination Events\n- **March 17 IDF announcement**: Israel initiated \"extensive strikes\" across Gaza, explicitly ending the ceasefire[2][6][11]. The Prime Minister's Office stated this action followed Hamas' refusal to accept U.S.-mediated proposals for hostage releases[2][11].\n- **Ground operations resumed**: On March 19, IDF troops re-entered Gaza to retake strategic positions like the Netzarim Corridor, with Defense Minister Israel Katz warning of intensified operations[14].\n- **Humanitarian impact**: Palestinian health officials reported over 400 killed in initial strikes, with subsequent casualties during ground operations[6][14].\n\n## Context of Breakdown\n- The original January 2025 agreement included three phases, but negotiations stalled over:\n  - Israel's refusal to discuss permanent ceasefire terms during Phase 2[2][3]\n  - Hamas' demand for full Israeli withdrawal before further hostage releases[2][7]\n  - Israel's aid blockade starting March 2 to pressure Hamas[5][7]\n\n## Verification Sources\n- **Primary**: IDF's official strike announcement via social media[Update]\n- **Secondary**: Multiple credible reports from CBS News, Sky News, and Jewish Telegraphic Agency confirming combat resumption[2][6][11][14]\n- **Hamas confirmation**: The group acknowledged Israel's unilateral termination of the agreement[11][14]\n\nThis satisfies the resolution condition requiring either official announcements or credible reporting consensus about the ceasefire's end before March 31, 2025.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930492 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:21:32 UTC",
