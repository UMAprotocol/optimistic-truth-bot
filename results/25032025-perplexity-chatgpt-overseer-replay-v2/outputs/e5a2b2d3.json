The ancillary data specifies that if the Devils win, it's p1; Oilers win, p2; postponed or canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The current date given is March 25, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the actual result using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the outcome. Source [1] mentions the Devils' 3-2 comeback win. Source [2] also states the Devils won 3-2. Source [4] from ESPN and [5] thescore.com both list the final score as Devils 3, Oilers 2. Additionally, source [6] and [8] reiterate the Devils' victory. All these sources are consistent, so there's no ambiguity. \n\nSince the Devils won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources are in agreement, so the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Edmonton Oilers and New Jersey Devils on March 13, 2025, concluded with a **3-2 victory for the New Jersey Devils**[1][2][4][5][6][8]. The Devils overcame a 2-1 deficit in the third period with goals from Jesper Bratt and Simon Nemec, securing their third consecutive win[1][4]. Key details include:\n\n- **Leon Draisaitl** scored his NHL-leading 47th goal for the Oilers, extending his point streak to 16 games[1][4].\n- **Jesper Bratt** led the Devils with 1 goal and 2 assists, his second consecutive three-point performance[1][4].\n- The Oilers lost their second straight game and eighth in 11 contests[1][4].\n\nSince the Devils won the game definitively and no postponement or cancellation occurred, the market resolves to **\"Devils\"** per the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the event (NHL game between the Oilers and Devils on March 13, 2025) has occurred and is not a future event relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). The response correctly states the outcome of the game as a win for the Devils with a score of 3-2, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions for a Devils win to resolve as p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the current date against the event date and proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple reliable sources. It provides a detailed account of the game, including key players and moments, which supports the resolution recommendation. The reasoning is thorough and leads directly to the recommended resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Devils win) is directly aligned with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event specified in the user prompt and uses verified sources to confirm the outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742935107 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:38:27 UTC",
