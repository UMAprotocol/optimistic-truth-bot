The ancillary data specifies that if East Carolina wins, it's p1; UTSA, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 13) is in the past. Now, looking at the search results. \n\nSearch result [1] is from the American Athletic Conference's site, dated March 14, 2025. It states East Carolina defeated UTSA 70-65 in the quarterfinals. That's a direct source. [3], [4], [5], [7], and [10] all confirm the same score and outcome. For example, [10] from ESPN's recap on March 13, 2025, shows the final score as ECU 70-65 UTSA. \n\nAdditionally, [3] mentions the spread was covered by ECU, which aligns with their win. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in any of the sources. All results point to the game being played as scheduled with ECU winning. \n\nSince the event happened, and all sources confirm East Carolina's victory, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information found. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nEast Carolina defeated UTSA 70-65 in their American Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament second-round game played on March 13, 2025, at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas[1][3][4][5][7][10]. The sixth-seeded Pirates (19-13) secured the victory behind Jordan Riley's 22-point, 12-rebound performance, with key contributions from RJ Felton (17 points) and Cam Hayes (16 points)[1][4][7]. The game featured 15 lead changes and 7 ties, with ECU making critical free throws in the final 20 seconds to seal the win[1][4].\n\nThis outcome qualifies for resolution under the defined market conditions as:\n- The game occurred as scheduled on March 13\n- No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in any verified sources\n- East Carolina achieved the decisive victory per multiple official game recaps\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the outcome of the UTSA vs. East Carolina game based on multiple reliable sources, including the American Athletic Conference's site and ESPN. The game's outcome is correctly reported with East Carolina winning against UTSA with a score of 70-65. This outcome is consistent with the user prompt's conditions for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the date of the event against the current date to confirm that the event has occurred in the past. It then proceeds to verify the outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The response also correctly notes that there was no evidence of the game being postponed or canceled.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the scheduled date and confirms the outcome through several sources. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to an East Carolina win.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response is thorough and uses multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome, which aligns with the best practices for verifying factual information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the response from Perplexity AI oracle is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
