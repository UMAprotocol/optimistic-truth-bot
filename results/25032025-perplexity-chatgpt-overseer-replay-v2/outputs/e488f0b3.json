The ancillary data specifies that if the Sharks win, it's p1; if the Blackhawks win, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game in question has already occurred. Checking the search results, multiple sources [1][2][5][7] report that the Sharks won 4-2. The box score from CBS Sports and NHL.com's video breakdown both confirm the Sharks' victory. Additionally, the YouTube highlights mention the Sharks ending a five-game home losing streak with this win. \n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources reference the game taking place as scheduled on March 13, with detailed stats and recaps. No indications of postponement or cancellation. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: Sharks win is p1. Since the game happened and the Sharks won definitively, the correct resolution is p1. No conflicting information in the sources, so no need for further checks.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Chicago Blackhawks and San Jose Sharks on March 13, 2025, concluded with a **4-2 victory for the San Jose Sharks**[1][2][7]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Collin Graf** scored two goals for the Sharks, including a power-play goal and a deflection[1][7].\n- **Will Smith** contributed one goal and an assist, while **Alexandar Georgiev** made 24 saves[1][2].\n- The Blackhawks' goals came from **Frank Nazar** and **Ilya Mikheyev**, but they lost their third consecutive game[1][7].\n\nThe game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in the sources. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Sharks\"** (p1) as the outcome. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It confirms the outcome of the game based on multiple reliable sources, stating that the San Jose Sharks won 4-2. This outcome matches the conditions set in the user prompt where a Sharks win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a thorough analysis by checking multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome and ensuring there were no postponements or cancellations. It includes specific details from the game, such as scores by individual players and overall game performance, which supports the credibility of the sources and the factual accuracy of the event's outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence on the specified date and checks for any deviations such as postponements or cancellations. It aligns the recommendation (p1) directly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where p1 corresponds to a Sharks win.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the user prompt's instructions and uses verified sources to confirm the event's outcome.\n\nGiven the thoroughness, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt instructions, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome based on reliable sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses multiple sources for verification, and provides a clear, factual basis for the resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
