The ancillary data specifies that if Purdue wins, it's p1; if USC wins, p2; postponed stays open; canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the event should have already happened. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [4], [8]) report that Purdue defeated USC 76-71 in the Big Ten Tournament on March 13, 2025. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources mention the game took place with a clear result. \n\nI should verify that the game in question is the same one referenced in the ancillary data. The date and teams match exactly. There's no mention of the game being rescheduled or canceled in any of the sources. In fact, sources [3] discuss a different set of games (women's basketball) being forfeited, which is unrelated. \n\nAll relevant search results confirm Purdue's victory. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Purdue). No conflicting information is present, and the event was completed as scheduled.\n</think>\n\nThe USC vs. Purdue men's basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 9:00 PM ET occurred as planned. Purdue defeated USC 76-71 in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament, as confirmed by multiple sources detailing the game's outcome[1][2][4][8]. The contest was not postponed or canceled, with both teams competing until the final buzzer. Purdue's victory was secured through clutch free throws by Trey Kaufman-Renn (30 points) and Braden Smith in the closing seconds[1][2]. \n\nGiven the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to **Purdue** (p1) as the decisive winner. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the USC vs. Purdue game occurred on March 13, 2025, and that Purdue won the game. The response adheres to the instructions by checking the event's occurrence against the current date and confirming the outcome through multiple sources. The response also correctly applies the resolution conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through reliable sources. It ensures that the game mentioned is the exact event specified in the user prompt and not a different or similar event. The response is complete as it covers all possible outcomes (win, postponed, canceled) and confirms the actual outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is reliable and not based on a single source. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Purdue\" (p1) aligns perfectly with the facts presented and the ancillary data conditions.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response is focused solely on the event in question and does not deviate into unrelated details or assumptions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory. It meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909190 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:26:30 UTC",
