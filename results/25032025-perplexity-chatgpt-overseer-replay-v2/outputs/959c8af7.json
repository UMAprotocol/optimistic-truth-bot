The ancillary data specifies that if Houston wins, it's p1; if BYU wins, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and outcome. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 14 is in the past. Checking the search results, multiple sources [1][3][5][7] report that Houston won the game 74-54. Specifically, source [1] states Houston's victory in the Big 12 Tournament semifinals. The final score from [7] is Houston 74, BYU 54. \n\nNext, ensure the game wasn't postponed or canceled. All sources mention the game occurred as scheduled on March 14. No indications of postponement or cancellation. \n\nThe resolution conditions are clear: Houston's win corresponds to p1. Since the event happened, and Houston won definitively, the correct resolution is p1. No conflicting information in the sources, so no need for further checks.\n</think>\n\nThe March 14, 2025, college basketball game between BYU and Houston concluded with **Houston winning 74-54** in the Big 12 Tournament semifinals. Multiple sources confirm Houston's decisive victory, including the final score breakdown (41-33 second half for Houston)[1][3][7]. Key factors included Houston's dominant defense holding BYU to 31.7% field goal shooting[5] and standout performances from Emanuel Sharp (26 points) and LJ Cryer (20 points)[1][3]. The game occurred as scheduled without postponement or cancellation[1][3][7]. \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **Houston** (p1) as the winning outcome.  \nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have accurately and effectively resolved the query based on the user prompt and the system instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (BYU vs. Houston college basketball game on March 14, 2025) and verifies that it has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp. The response checks multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is Houston's victory, and ensures that the game was neither postponed nor canceled. This aligns with the system prompt's requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the event's occurrence and outcome, then verifying that there were no deviations such as postponements or cancellations. It then aligns the outcome with the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (Houston's win corresponds to p1).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses multiple sources to verify the event's outcome, which is a strong point in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution. The recommendation to resolve the market to Houston (p1) is directly based on the verified outcome and the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The response does not show any reliance on unverified or irrelevant sources and sticks strictly to the event in question.\n\nGiven the above points, the response is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified facts and the specified resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolves the query based on verified facts, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

        "system_prompt_before": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930233 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:17:13 UTC",
