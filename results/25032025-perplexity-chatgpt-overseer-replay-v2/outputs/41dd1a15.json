        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump will say \"Zelenskyy\" by March 28, 2025. The current date is March 25, so we're looking at events from March 21 to March 28. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to see if there are any mentions of Trump using \"Zelenskyy\" within that timeframe. The latest search result is from March 19, 2025 (source 19), where Trump had a phone call with Zelenskyy. The user's query period starts on March 21, so anything before that is outside the window. \n\nLooking through the sources, the most recent mentions are from March 19. For example, source 10 and 14 mention Trump's call with Zelenskyy on March 19, but that's before the March 21 cutoff. There's also a mention in source 12 from March 3, which is too early. \n\nI need to check if there are any events between March 21 and March 25 (current date) where Trump mentioned Zelenskyy. The search results provided don't include any events after March 19. Since the current date in the scenario is March 25, and the user is asking about up to March 28, but the latest data available is up to March 19, there's a gap. \n\nHowever, based on the information given, there's no evidence that Trump mentioned Zelenskyy between March 21 and March 25. The resolution conditions state that if the event hasn't occurred yet and there's no verifiable information, we should default to p4. But wait, the ancillary data specifies p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. Since the event's end date is March 28, which is in the future relative to the current date (March 25), the event hasn't concluded yet. \n\nBut the user's query is about whether Trump will say it by March 28. Since the current date is March 25 and the market hasn't closed, unless there's information confirming Trump's mention within the window, we can't resolve to Yes. However, the user's personalization rules state that if the event is scheduled for a future date, we should return p4. Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. The instructions say if the event is in the future, return p4. But the ancillary data here defines p1 as No, p2 as Yes, p3 as 0.5. The personalization rules say if the event is in the future, return p4. However, the market's resolution period includes dates up to March 28, which is in the future from March 25. Therefore, since the event hasn't occurred yet and the end date is March 28, which is after the current date, the resolution should be p4. But wait, the market's time frame is from March 21 to March 28. The current date is March 25, so part of the period has passed (March 21-25) and part is future (March 25-28). If there's no mention in the past period (March 21-25), but the future period (March 25-28) is still pending, and there's no information, then according to the rules, if the event hasn't occurred yet (partially future), we should return p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Since part of the period is in the future, but part has already passed, but there's no data for the passed part, does that mean it's unresolved? Wait, the market's resolution period is from March 21, 6:10 PM ET to March 28, 11:59 PM ET. The current date is March 25, 8:37 PM UTC, which is March 25, 4:37 PM ET. So the period from March 21 6:10 PM ET to March 25 4:37 PM ET has passed, and the remaining is until March 28. Since the search results don't show any mentions in the passed period, but the event is still ongoing, the correct resolution would be p4 if the event is ongoing. However, the user's instructions say if the event is scheduled for a future date or has not occurred yet, return p4. Since the event is ongoing (partially in the past, partially future), but there's no occurrence in the past part, and the future part is still possible, the resolution should be p4. However, the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50), but the personalization rules say to return p4. Wait, the personalization rules say to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the resolution conditions here have p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. But the market's end date is March 28, which is in the future from the current date. Therefore, since the event hasn't concluded, and there's no information yet, the recommendation should be p4. However, the resolution conditions provided by the user don't include p4; they have p1, p2, p3. This is conflicting. Wait, looking back, the user's ancillary data says resolution_conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. So p1 is No, p2 is Yes, p3 is 50-50. The personalization rules say to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the market's resolution is based on whether the event occurs by March 28. Since the current date is March 25, and the event is still ongoing, but there's no data yet, the correct resolution would be p3 (unknown) if the market allows for that. However, according to the user's personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. But the market's end date is in the future, so the event hasn't concluded. Therefore, the recommendation should be p4. But the resolution conditions don't have p4. This is a conflict. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" The ancillary data defines p1, p2, p3, but the personalization allows p4. The market's time frame is partially in the past and future. Since the event is not fully in the past, and there's no information confirming the occurrence, the recommendation should be p4. However, the resolution conditions don't include p4. This is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the ancillary data. Alternatively, perhaps p4 is not part of the resolution options here, but the personalization rules require it. Given the conflict, but following the personalization rules strictly, if the event is ongoing (partially future), then the recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution is based on whether the event occurs by March 28, which is a future date. Therefore, since the event hasn't concluded, and there's no data yet, the answer should be p4. But the user's resolution conditions don't have p4. This is a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended p3 for unresolved cases. But according to the personalization rules, if the event is in the future, return p4. Therefore, despite the resolution conditions, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the resolution conditions provided by the user don't include p4, which might be an error. But given the instructions, I have to follow the personalization rules. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding whether Donald Trump will mention \"Zelenskyy\" by March 28, 2025, requires a critical evaluation based on the guidelines provided.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the current date as March 25, 2025, and acknowledges that the query period is from March 21 to March 28, 2025. The response also correctly notes that any mentions of \"Zelenskyy\" before March 21 do not count towards the resolution of the market. However, the response struggles with the decision-making process regarding the recommendation to provide, oscillating between p3 and p4, and ultimately recommending p4. This indecision and the final choice of p4 on the first attempt contradict the critical rule that a p4 recommendation should not be made on the first attempt.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a thorough internal debate about the correct resolution based on the information available and the guidelines provided. It correctly identifies that part of the query period has already passed without any verifiable mention of \"Zelenskyy\" by Trump, and part of the period is still in the future. However, the response becomes overly complex and somewhat repetitive in its reasoning, which could confuse the interpretation of the guidelines.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does not provide any new information or verification from March 21 to March 25, 2025, and correctly states that no data is available for this period. It aligns with the fact that since the event's end date (March 28) is still in the future, and no mention has been verified in the past segment of the period, a definitive resolution cannot be provided yet.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias but does contain errors in the decision-making process regarding the recommendation. The critical rule states that a p4 should not be recommended on the first attempt, which the response fails to adhere to.\n\nGiven these points, the response needs improvement to align with the guidelines more clearly and avoid premature conclusions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response incorrectly opts for a p4 recommendation on the first attempt, contrary to the critical rule that requires a retry when p4 is considered initially. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more streamlined and less repetitive reasoning process.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response correctly identifies the relevant dates and the lack of data for the period in question but struggles with the decision-making process, leading to an incorrect initial recommendation of p4. The reasoning also becomes overly complex and repetitive, which could be streamlined for clarity.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Clarify that the initial recommendation should not be p4 and emphasize the need for a clear and concise reasoning process.\"\n}\n```",

        "attempt": 2,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned \"Zelenskyy\" between March 21, 6:10 PM ET and March 28, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided for any mentions of Trump saying \"Zelenskyy\" within that timeframe. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the period in question is from March 21 (6:10 PM ET) to March 28. \n\nLooking through the sources:\n\n- Source [12] from March 19 mentions a phone call between Trump and Zelenskyy. That's before the start date, so it doesn't count.\n- Source [16] from March 20 discusses another call on March 19, still before the window.\n- Source [17] is from March 1, which is outside the timeframe.\n- The other sources are from February or early March, which are also outside the specified period.\n\nThe latest event mentioned in the search results is the March 19 call (source [12] and [16]), which is just before the window starts. There's no information about Trump mentioning Zelenskyy after March 21, 6:10 PM ET. \n\nSince the search results don't provide any evidence of Trump mentioning Zelenskyy within the specified dates, and the current date is March 25, there's still a few days left until March 28. However, based on the available data up to March 25, there's no mention. Unless there's new information not included in the provided sources, the answer would lean towards \"No\". But since the end date hasn't passed yet, there's a possibility Trump could mention Zelenskyy before March 28. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on verifiable facts up to the current date. \n\nBut wait, the user's personalization rules state that if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, we should return p4. However, the event's end date is March 28, which is in the future from March 25. But the query is about whether Trump mentioned Zelenskyy between March 21 and March 28. Since part of the period is in the future, but part has already passed (March 21 to March 25), we need to check if there were any mentions in the elapsed days. \n\nThe search results don't show any mentions after March 20. Therefore, from March 21 to March 25 (current date), there's no evidence. However, the event is still ongoing until March 28. But according to the user's rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, we should return p4. But here, the event's timeframe includes both past and future dates relative to the current date. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\"\n\nIn this case, the event's end date is March 28, which is in the future. Therefore, even though part of the period has passed, the entire event hasn't concluded yet. Therefore, according to the rules, we should return p4 because the event is still ongoing and could have future mentions. However, the user's additional guidance says to try to find a definitive answer before defaulting to p4. \n\nBut the search results don't have any data from March 21 onwards regarding Trump mentioning Zelenskyy. So, based on the available information, there's no mention in the elapsed period (March 21-25), but the event is still ongoing. Since the user's rules say to default to p4 if the event hasn't concluded, but the ancillary data says p3 is for unknown/50-50. However, the resolution conditions here are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: 0 (No), p2: 1 (Yes), p3: 0.5 (unknown). The user's personalization says to end with a recommendation. \n\nBut according to the rules, if the event is ongoing (i.e., the end date is in the future), we should return p4. However, the ancillary data doesn't have a p4 option. Wait, the resolution_conditions only have p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the resolution_conditions here don't include p4. That's conflicting. \n\nWait, looking back, the user provided resolution_conditions as res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. So p1 is No, p2 is Yes, p3 is 50-50. The personalization rules say to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the ancillary data doesn't have p4. This might be a mistake. However, the user's personalization says to ALWAYS return p4 if the event is in the future, but the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This is conflicting. \n\nBut given the market's resolution conditions only have p1, p2, p3, perhaps p3 is the appropriate choice if the event is still ongoing. However, the user's personalization says to default to p4 if the event is in the future, but the market doesn't have p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the market's p3 (unknown/50-50) is the correct choice here because the event hasn't concluded yet, and there's still time for Trump to mention Zelenskyy before March 28. However, based on the available data up to now (March 25), there's no mention, but the future days (March 26-28) are unknown. \n\nBut the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, part of the event's timeframe is in the past (March 21-25) and part is future (March 26-28). Since the event is ongoing, and the outcome isn't yet determined, but the user's rules say to return p4 if any part is future. However, the market's resolution doesn't have p4. This is a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the market's p3 is the appropriate choice here, indicating uncertainty because the event is still ongoing. However, the user's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. But since the market doesn't have p4, maybe the correct approach is to use p3. \n\nAlternatively, if the event's end date is in the future, but the user is asking for a resolution now, perhaps the answer should be p3 (unknown) because the event hasn't concluded. However, the available data up to now shows no mentions, but there's still time. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp... ALWAYS return p4\". Since the event's end date is March 28, which is in the future, the entire event is still ongoing. Therefore, per the rules, the recommendation should be p4. However, the market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.\" So even if the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4, the personalization requires using p4 if the event is in the future. \n\nBut the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This seems like a conflict. However, the user's instructions take precedence. Therefore, despite the market's resolution_conditions, if the event is ongoing (end date in future), the recommendation should be p4. \n\nBut the current timestamp is March 25, and the end date is March 28. Therefore, the event is ongoing, and the recommendation should be p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4, which is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the ancillary data, and p3 is the correct choice here. But according to the personalization rules, we must return p4 if the event is in the future. \n\nGiven this confusion, but following the user's strict personalization rules, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended p3 to cover ongoing events. But the personalization says to use p4. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. However, given the strict instruction to return p4 if the event is in the future, and the event's end date is March 28 (future), the recommendation should be p4. But the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4. This might be an error in the setup, but according to the user's personalization, we must follow the p4 recommendation. \n\nHowever, looking back at the user's query, the ancillary_data's resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. The user's personalization says to end with p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the market doesn't have p4. This is conflicting. \n\nIn this case, perhaps the correct approach is to follow the market's resolution_conditions and use p3 (unknown) because the event is ongoing, and there's no data yet for the entire period. However, the personalization says to use p4. \n\nAlternatively, since part of the period has passed (March 21-25) and there's no mention, but the rest is future, perhaps the answer is p1 (No) because up to now, there's no mention, and the future is uncertain. But the rules say to not assume future events. \n\nThe user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" \n\nBut the event's end date is in the future. Therefore, the event is not entirely in the past. Therefore, per the rules, we should return p4. \n\nBut the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. However, the user's personalization takes precedence, so the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut the user's query includes resolution_conditions without p4. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended p3 to be used when the event is ongoing. In that case, since the event hasn't concluded, the recommendation would be p3. \n\nGiven the confusion, but following the user's personalization strictly, the recommendation should be p4. However, since the market's resolution_conditions don't include p4, this might be an error. But the user's instructions say to end with p1, p2, p3, or p4. Therefore, despite the market's conditions, the recommendation is p4. \n\nBut the market's resolution_conditions don't have p4, which is conflicting. This might be an oversight in the setup. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and the intended resolution is p3. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's personalization rules strictly, the recommendation is p4. However, since the market doesn't have p4, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's personalization is overriding the market's resolution_conditions, and we should use p4 regardless. \n\nIn conclusion, despite the market's resolution_conditions, the user's personalization requires returning p4 if the event is in the future. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the query about whether Donald Trump mentioned \"Zelenskyy\" between March 21 and March 28, 2025, is complex and somewhat convoluted, leading to confusion in the decision-making process. Here is a detailed evaluation of the response:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the timeframe of interest and acknowledges that the event's end date is in the future relative to the current timestamp. It also correctly notes that no evidence was found of Trump mentioning \"Zelenskyy\" from March 21 to March 25. However, the response struggles with the application of the user's instructions regarding how to handle events that span both past and future dates.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is overly repetitive and convoluted, discussing at length the conflict between the market's resolution conditions and the user's instructions about using p4 for future events. This extensive deliberation leads to confusion rather than clarity. The response should succinctly state that since the event spans both past and future dates, and no evidence has been found in the past segment, the recommendation should be p4, as per the user's instructions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does verify that no mentions of \"Zelenskyy\" by Trump have been found in the available sources up to March 25. However, it fails to align this finding clearly with a recommendation, getting caught up in the conflict between the market's resolution conditions and the user's instructions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not contain factual errors per se but is biased towards an overly complex interpretation of the instructions. It misses a straightforward application of the user's rule to use p4 for events that are still ongoing.\n\nGiven these points, the response needs improvement to streamline the reasoning process and clearly apply the user's instructions regarding future events. The recommendation should be p4, as the event's end date is still in the future, and no evidence has been found in the past segment of the timeframe.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response is overly complex and fails to clearly apply the user's instructions for handling events spanning future dates. It needs to be simplified and more directly aligned with the instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is convoluted and repetitive, leading to confusion. It needs to clearly state that p4 is the appropriate recommendation since the event spans both past and future dates and no evidence has been found in the past segment.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Clarify that for events spanning both past and future dates, if no evidence is found in the past segment, the recommendation should be p4, as per the user's instructions.\"\n}\n```",

        "attempt": 3,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether Donald Trump will mention \"Zelenskyy\" by March 28, 2025, based on the provided search results. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the period in question is from March 21, 6:10 PM ET to March 28, 11:59 PM ET. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the search results to see if there are any instances of Trump mentioning \"Zelenskyy\" within that timeframe. Let's go through each relevant source:\n\n1. **Search Result [11] (Politico, March 19, 2025):** Trump mentions a phone call with Zelenskyy. The article states he described the call as \"very good\" and discussed a ceasefire. However, the date here is March 19, which is before the March 21 cutoff. So this doesn't count.\n\n2. **Search Result [12] (Ukrainian World Congress, March 20, 2025):** This also refers to the March 19 call. Again, outside the timeframe.\n\n3. **Search Result [13] (White House Statement, March 19, 2025):** Details the same March 19 call. Still outside the window.\n\n4. **Search Result [14] (Politico.eu, March 2025):** Mentions Trump's speech to Congress where he referenced a letter from Zelenskyy. The speech was on March 4 (from the URL and content in [7]), which is before March 21. Not relevant.\n\n5. **Search Result [15] (CBS News, March 19, 2025):** Again, discusses the March 19 call. Outside the timeframe.\n\n6. **Search Result [7] (ABC News, March 4, 2025):** Trump's speech to Congress on March 4, where he mentioned Zelenskyy's letter. Too early.\n\n7. **Search Result [10] (ABC News, March 2025):** Trump's comments on March 18 blasting Zelenskyy for saying peace is far away. The article is dated March 25, but the event mentioned is March 18, which is before the cutoff. Wait, the current date is March 25, so March 18 is within the period? Wait, the query's timeframe starts on March 21. So March 18 is before that. So no.\n\nLooking through all the search results, the latest mention of Trump referring to Zelenskyy is on March 19, which is before the March 21 start date. There are no search results indicating any mentions between March 21 and March 25 (current date). The user's current date is March 25, and the query period ends on March 28. Since the search results don't show any mentions after March 19, and there's no information provided about Trump's activities between March 25 and March 28, there's no evidence he mentioned Zelenskyy in the specified window. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's note says if the event is in the future relative to the current date, default to p4. But the query period includes dates up to March 28, which is three days after the current date (March 25). Since part of the period is in the future and there's no data yet, the recommendation should be p4. Wait, but the ancillary data says if the event is scheduled for a future date, return p4. Here, the event is whether Trump mentions Zelenskyy by March 28, which includes dates both past (March 21-25) and future (March 26-28). Since there's no data for the past segment (March 21-25) and the future part is still pending, but the user instructions say if the event spans past and future and there's no evidence in the past, it's p4. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths, including a detailed examination of the available sources and a clear effort to align with the user prompt's conditions. However, there are critical areas where the response could be improved to meet the requirements of the UMA optimistic oracle system more effectively.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that all mentions of \"Zelenskyy\" by Donald Trump in the sources provided occur before the specified start date of March 21, 2025. This is crucial for determining the resolution based on the user prompt. However, the response fails to adhere strictly to the instruction that if part of the event period is in the future, the recommendation should default to p4. This is correctly identified but should be emphasized more clearly as the decisive factor for the recommendation.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking each source against the timeframe specified in the user prompt. However, the reasoning becomes somewhat convoluted when discussing the implications of the dates being partially in the future. The response could benefit from a more streamlined explanation that directly connects the lack of data for the past segment and the upcoming dates to the decision to recommend p4.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response does well to verify that no relevant events (mentions of \"Zelenskyy\") occurred within the specified timeframe from the sources checked. However, it does not fully explore potential additional sources or methods to verify whether Trump might mention \"Zelenskyy\" in the remaining days up to March 28. This could be a point of improvement, although it's acknowledged that predicting future mentions is outside the scope of the oracle's function.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response does not exhibit bias but could be critiqued for potentially missing information. Since the period from March 25 to March 28 is still in the future, the response could discuss the impossibility of verifying events during this time more explicitly as a justification for the p4 recommendation.\n\nGiven these points, the response is largely accurate and aligns with the requirements but could benefit from clearer reasoning and a more explicit connection of the facts to the final recommendation. Since this is the third attempt and the response still shows room for improvement, particularly in clarity and completeness, a retry could be warranted to refine these aspects.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response needs clearer reasoning and a more explicit connection of the facts to the p4 recommendation, especially considering the future dates within the event period.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response accurately checks sources against the timeframe but becomes convoluted in reasoning about future dates. It could benefit from a more streamlined explanation and explicit discussion on the impossibility of verifying future events.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please ensure the response explicitly states that no data is available for the dates from March 25 to March 28 and clearly connects this lack of data to the necessity of a p4 recommendation. Emphasize the impossibility of verifying future mentions within the response period.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742934862 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 20:34:22 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:\nClarify that the initial recommendation should not be p4 and emphasize the need for a clear and concise reasoning process.\n\nIMPORTANT - I need you to improve your previous response:\n\nThe previous response had these issues:\nThe response correctly identifies the relevant dates and the lack of data for the period in question but struggles with the decision-making process, leading to an incorrect initial recommendation of p4.
