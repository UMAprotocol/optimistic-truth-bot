The ancillary data specifies that if Wisconsin wins, it's p2; Michigan, p1; postponed stays open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 16, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, [1] from uwbadgers.com states that Wisconsin lost to Michigan 59-53 in the Big Ten Championship. Similarly, [5] from mgoblue.com confirms Michigan's victory with the same score. Both are official team websites, so they're reliable. \n\nOther sources like [2], [4], [6], and [8] discuss predictions and odds before the game, but the key here is the actual result. The ESPN video in [3] is about a previous game in the semifinals, not the final. [7] is historical data about past tournaments, not relevant here. \n\nSince the game occurred on March 16 and Michigan won, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirming the result are from reputable sites, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Wisconsin vs. Michigan men's basketball game scheduled for March 16, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET was played as planned. Michigan defeated Wisconsin 59-53 in the Big Ten Tournament Championship game[1][5]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome was definitively determined with Michigan as the winner. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the Wisconsin vs. Michigan game occurred on March 16, 2025, and that Michigan won the game with a score of 59-53. This outcome is confirmed by reliable sources from the official team websites (uwbadgers.com and mgoblue.com). The response adheres to the instructions by verifying the event's occurrence and outcome through these sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by checking the current date and confirming that the game date is in the past. It then verifies the outcome using reliable sources and correctly aligns this with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The reasoning is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the event's outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the game was not postponed or canceled and that Michigan won. This verification is aligned with the ancillary data where Michigan's win corresponds to a resolution of p1. The recommendation of p1 is therefore correctly aligned with the verified facts and the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not omit any crucial information necessary for resolving the query. It focuses solely on the event in question without deviating to unrelated details.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response by Perplexity AI is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data and the verified outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the Wisconsin vs. Michigan game, aligns with the ancillary data, and adheres to the system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used reliable sources to confirm the event's outcome and provided a clear, accurate resolution recommendation.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
