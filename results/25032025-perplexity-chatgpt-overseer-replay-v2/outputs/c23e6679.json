        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Guram Kutateladze vs. Kaue Fernandes fight at UFC Fight Night on March 22, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Fernandes wins, it's p1; Kutateladze wins, p2; and if there's a draw, postponement, or cancellation, it's p3. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the event has already happened.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to determine the fight's outcome. Looking at the sources:\n\nSearch result [2] from MMA Junkie clearly states that Kaue Fernandes defeated Guram Kutateladze via unanimous decision with all judges scoring it 30-27. The fight took place on March 22, 2025, as part of UFC Fight Night 255. This is a primary source and directly reports the result.\n\nSearch result [4] from ESPN's fight center also confirms Fernandes' victory by unanimous decision, listing the result as a unanimous decision in round 3. The stats there show Fernandes outstruck Kutateladze significantly, supporting the decision.\n\nAdditionally, source [8] is a post-fight interview with Fernandes where he discusses his win, further corroborating the result. \n\nOther sources like [1] and [3] are pre-fight analyses and predictions, which aren't relevant post-event. Sources [5], [6], and [7] discuss other fights on the card but don't contradict the Fernandes victory.\n\nSince the event date is in the past and multiple credible sources (MMA Junkie, ESPN) confirm Fernandes as the winner, the market should resolve to p1. There's no mention of the fight being a draw, postponed, or canceled, so p3 doesn't apply. All conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nKaue Fernandes defeated Guram Kutateladze via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27) at UFC Fight Night 255 on March 22, 2025[2][4]. The bout occurred as scheduled, with Fernandes outstriking Kutateladze 79-36 in significant strikes and controlling the fight across all three rounds[2][4]. Multiple verified sources including ESPN's official fight statistics and MMA Junkie's post-event coverage confirm Fernandes as the winner[2][4][8]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742907523 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 12:58:43 UTC"
