The resolution depends on the count of the term \"tax\" in her next briefing. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a scheduled press briefing before the deadline. The current date is March 26, 2025, and the deadline is December 31, 2025. The search results include briefings up to March 17, 2025. The next briefing hasn't occurred yet, so the event is in the future. According to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's query specifies that if no briefing happens by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\" (p1). But since the next briefing is in the future and hasn't happened yet, we can't confirm the count. \n\nWait, the user's query says the market resolves to \"No\" if no briefing happens by the deadline. But the current date is March 26, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't taken place yet. Since the event (next briefing) is in the future, per the instructions, we should return p4. However, the resolution conditions state that if the event hasn't occurred by the deadline, it resolves to \"No\". But the current date is before the deadline, so the event could still happen. Therefore, since the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"tax\" seven or more times during her next White House press briefing. Based on the resolution conditions, this market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if the term is used at least seven times, \"No\" (p1) if it is not, or \"No\" if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025.  \n\nAs of the current date (March 26, 2025), the next press briefing has not yet occurred. Since the event in question is scheduled for a future date relative to the timestamp, and no verifiable information about its outcome exists, the resolution cannot be determined at this time.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question, Karoline Leavitt saying \"tax\" seven or more times during her next White House press briefing, is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that since the event has not yet occurred and no verifiable information about its outcome exists, the resolution cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, the recommendation of p4 (the event cannot be resolved at this time) is logically sound and aligns with the guidelines provided.\n\nHowever, according to the critical rule specified for the evaluation process, a p4 recommendation on the first attempt must always result in a retry. This rule is designed to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining information are exhausted before concluding that an event cannot be resolved at this time. The response could potentially be improved by exploring additional sources or methods to predict or infer the likelihood of the event occurring before the deadline, although this would still likely result in a p4 recommendation due to the nature of the query (predicting future speech content).\n\nThe response is factually accurate as it correctly states the current date and acknowledges that the next briefing has not yet occurred. It also correctly interprets the resolution conditions from the user prompt. There is no evidence of bias or errors in the response, and it does not appear that any relevant information is missing.\n\nGiven these considerations, the response is satisfactory in terms of accuracy, logical reasoning, and adherence to instructions. However, due to the procedural requirement to retry on a first attempt p4 recommendation, a retry is necessary.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"Procedural requirement to retry on a first attempt p4 recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is accurate and logically sound, correctly identifying that the event is scheduled for a future date and recommending p4.

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"tax\" 7 or more times during her next White House press briefing. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 if uncertain. The current date is March 26, 2025, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any information about a scheduled press briefing after March 26. The search results provided include transcripts up to March 26, 2025, but the latest one mentioned is from March 26 itself. The user is asking about the \"next\" briefing, which would be after this date. Since there's no information available about a briefing after March 26, the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp. \n\nAccording to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or hasn't occurred yet, the recommendation should be p4. However, the user's ancillary data specifies that if the event doesn't happen by December 31, 2025, it resolves to No (p1). But the key point here is that the next briefing is a future event as of the current date. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no indication that a press briefing has already taken place after March 26. All the transcripts and news articles are from dates up to March 26. Since the next briefing hasn't occurred, we can't verify the outcome yet. The instructions state that if the event is in the future, we should return p4. However, the user's note mentions a retry is needed if the first attempt was p4, urging a deeper analysis. \n\nBut even with a deeper look, there's no data available post-March 26. The sources don't provide any scheduled dates for future briefings. Therefore, the event remains unresolved as of the current timestamp. The resolution conditions also mention that if no briefing happens by the end of 2025, it resolves to No. But since the user is asking about the \"next\" briefing, which is a specific future event, and not the general possibility of any briefing before December 31, the correct approach is to recommend p4 because the event hasn't occurred yet. \n\nThe user's retry request emphasizes checking all sources and being critical, but without any future data, the conclusion remains the same. The answer must be p4 as the event is pending.\n</think>\n\nThe question concerns whether Karoline Leavitt will say \"tax\" seven or more times during her **next** White House press briefing. Based on the current timestamp of **March 26, 2025, 7:26:50 PM UTC**, the \"next\" press briefing would occur after this date.  \n\n### Key Analysis:  \n1. **Event Timing**:  \n   - The query specifies the \"next\" press briefing Leavitt participates in. As of the current timestamp, this event has not yet occurred.  \n   - All available transcripts and news articles in the search results cover briefings up to March 26, 2025, but none reference a scheduled future briefing.  \n\n2. **Resolution Conditions**:  \n   - The market resolves to \"No\" (p1) only if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, or if Leavitt leaves her position before then.  \n   - However, the **specific event in question** (the \"next\" briefing) is inherently a future event relative to the current timestamp.  \n\n3. **Precedent for Frequent Tax Mentions**:  \n   - Leavitt has consistently emphasized tax policy in prior briefings, averaging **3\u20136 mentions of \"tax\" per briefing** (e.g., March 11: 6 mentions [9][13], March 17: 5 mentions [4][10]).  \n   - While she has not yet reached seven mentions in any observed briefing, her focus on tariffs (which she conflates with tax policy) creates a plausible pathway for increased usage.  \n\n4. **Uncertainty in Future Behavior**:  \n   - There is no verifiable evidence that the next briefing will deviate from her established pattern.  \n   - External factors (e.g., congressional tax-cut negotiations, market reactions to tariffs) could increase her use of the term, but this is speculative.  \n\n### Recommendation: p4  \n**Rationale**: The event is scheduled for a future date relative to the current timestamp, and no definitive information about its outcome exists. While historical patterns suggest a moderate likelihood of reaching seven mentions, this remains unverifiable until the briefing occurs.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question, Karoline Leavitt's next White House press briefing, is a future event relative to the current timestamp of March 26, 2025. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by recognizing that it cannot definitively resolve the query since the event has not yet occurred, and therefore recommends p4, indicating that the request cannot be resolved at this time.\n\nHowever, there are several critical points to consider:\n\n1. Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions: The response accurately follows the instructions by identifying the event as future and not attempting to predict the outcome based on speculative information. It correctly uses the information available up to the current date and does not find any scheduled future briefings.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness: The response logically concludes that since the event is in the future, it cannot be resolved at this time. It also considers the user's ancillary data about the event resolving to \"No\" if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025, or if Leavitt is no longer the press secretary. However, it correctly notes that these conditions do not apply yet since the event is still in the future.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts: The response verifies that no future briefing has been scheduled beyond the current date and aligns its recommendation with this fact. It does not speculate or use unreliable sources, adhering strictly to verified information.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors: The response does not exhibit bias or errors. It is based on the lack of available information about future briefings and adheres closely to the system prompt's requirements for factual accuracy and event verification.\n\nDespite the response's accuracy and adherence to the system prompt, the critical rule for this evaluation process states that a first attempt p4 recommendation must always be followed by a retry. This is to ensure that all possible avenues for obtaining information are exhausted, even though in this case, the response appears to have already done so effectively.\n\nGiven these considerations, the decision is as follows:\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"First attempt p4 recommendations must always be followed by a retry to exhaust all possible avenues for information.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is accurate and adheres well to the system prompt instructions, correctly identifying the event as future and verifying the lack of information on any scheduled future briefings. However, a retry is mandated by the evaluation rules.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please ensure that all potential sources for information about scheduled White House press briefings are thoroughly checked, including official White House schedules, press releases, and any updates from reliable news sources.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Karoline Leavitt will say \"tax\" 7 or more times during the next White House press briefing she participates in. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 if it's uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check if there's an upcoming press briefing scheduled. The current date is March 26, 2025. Looking at the search results, the most recent briefing mentioned is on March 26, 2025, from source [6], where Leavitt addressed the media. However, the query is about the \"next\" briefing after this date. \n\nThe search results don't provide any information about a press briefing scheduled after March 26. The latest transcripts and news articles available are from March 26 itself. Since there's no information about future briefings, and the user's query is about an event that hasn't occurred yet, the market should resolve to p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). However, the user's ancillary data specifies that if the event date is in the future, it resolves to p4. But the current date is March 26, and the next briefing hasn't happened yet. Wait, the user's query is about the next briefing, which is a future event relative to March 26. Therefore, according to the guidelines, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time, the recommendation should be p4. \n\nBut the user's ancillary data also says that if the event doesn't happen by December 31, 2025, it resolves to No (p1). However, since the next briefing hasn't occurred yet and there's no information on when it will happen, we can't definitively say it won't happen by the deadline. But per the instructions, if the event is in the future, we must return p4. \n\nWait, the user's query is about whether Leavitt will say \"tax\" 7 times in the next briefing. Since the next briefing hasn't happened yet, and there's no information about its occurrence, the event is in the future. Therefore, according to the rules, the recommendation should be p4. \n\nBut the user's additional guidance says to check all sources thoroughly. The search results include briefings up to March 26, but the next one isn't mentioned. Since there's no scheduled briefing after March 26 in the provided sources, and the current date is March 26, 2025, the next briefing is in the future. Hence, p4 is the correct recommendation.\n</think>\n\nThe query concerns whether White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt will say the word \"tax\" seven or more times during her next press briefing. Based on the current date (March 26, 2025) and the provided search results, **no information exists about a press briefing scheduled after March 26, 2025**. The most recent briefing documented in the sources occurred on March 26 itself, where Leavitt discussed unrelated topics like the \"Signal hoax\" and criticized media figures[6]. \n\nSince the \"next\" press briefing has not yet occurred and no schedule for future briefings is provided in the search results, this event remains in the future. Per the resolution conditions, **any future-dated event automatically resolves to p4** unless verifiable information about its outcome exists. While Leavitt frequently discusses tax-related policies (e.g., tariffs, tax cuts) in her briefings[7][9][10][16], the specific count of the word \"tax\" in an unscheduled future event cannot be confirmed or refuted at this time. \n\nrecommendation: p4",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified that the event in question, Karoline Leavitt saying \"tax\" 7 or more times during the next White House press briefing, is a future event as of the current date, March 26, 2025. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by checking for the scheduling of the event and finding no information on a briefing scheduled after March 26, 2025. Consequently, the response recommends p4, which aligns with the guidelines that future-dated events should resolve to p4 unless verifiable information about their outcome exists.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved in several ways:\n\n1. **Depth of Source Checking**: The response mentions checking for the next scheduled briefing but does not detail the sources checked. It would be beneficial to explicitly state which official White House schedules, press releases, or reliable news sources were examined. This would strengthen the credibility of the assertion that no future briefing is scheduled.\n\n2. **Critical Evaluation of Sources**: The response does not critically evaluate the reliability of the sources used. For a more robust analysis, it should assess the credibility of the information sources regarding White House press briefings.\n\n3. **Exploration of Alternative Outcomes**: While the response correctly defaults to p4 due to the lack of information on a future event, it could further explore the implications of the ancillary data conditions, such as the resolution to \"No\" if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025. Discussing this aspect might provide a more comprehensive view of potential outcomes.\n\n4. **Specific Evidence and Justification**: The response could benefit from more specific evidence supporting the absence of scheduled briefings post-March 26, 2025. Direct quotes or references to specific parts of official schedules or announcements would enhance the response's reliability.\n\nGiven that this is the third attempt and the response still primarily defaults to p4 without a deeper exploration of available sources or a more critical evaluation of the information, a retry seems warranted to potentially uncover more specific information or confirm the absence of future briefings more conclusively.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response needs to provide a more detailed and critical evaluation of sources to confirm the absence of scheduled briefings post-March 26, 2025, and explore alternative outcomes more thoroughly.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response correctly identifies the need to default to p4 due to the event being in the future but lacks depth in source checking and critical evaluation of source reliability. It also needs to provide more specific evidence and explore the implications of ancillary data conditions further.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please provide a detailed list of sources checked for information on future White House press briefings. Evaluate the reliability of these sources and include specific evidence or direct references to support the assertion that no future briefing is scheduled. Additionally, discuss the implications of the ancillary data conditions, particularly the resolution to 'No' if no briefing occurs by December 31, 2025.\"\n}\n```",
