The ancillary data specifies that if the Wizards win, it's p2; Pistons win is p1, and if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 13, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current date of March 25, 2025. So no issue there. Now, I need to verify the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the result. The CBS Sports recap [3] states the Wizards won 129-125. ESPN's recap [6] also has the same score, with Alex Sarr making key plays late. The YouTube videos [1][2][4][7] all mention the Wizards defeating the Pistons, with the final score consistent across sources. \n\nThe key points from the sources: Wizards' Alex Sarr scored 19 points, blocked a crucial shot, and the final score was 129-125 in favor of Washington. The Pistons' Cade Cunningham had a high score but the team lost. All evidence points to a Wizards victory. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nSince the event occurred and the Wizards won, the resolution should be p2 as per the ancillary data. No conflicting information found. All sources agree on the outcome.\n</think>\n\nThe Washington Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons 129-125 in their NBA game on March 13, 2025[1][3][6]. Alex Sarr led the Wizards with 19 points, including a crucial go-ahead dunk with 53 seconds remaining followed by a game-changing block on Cade Cunningham's dunk attempt[3][6]. The Wizards closed strong, shooting 61% in the fourth quarter compared to Detroit's 35%[3][6].\n\nKey moments:\n- **Fourth quarter surge**: Washington made 5/10 three-pointers in the final period while Detroit went 0/8 from beyond the arc[3][6]\n- **Clutch defense**: Sarr's block on Cunningham with 38 seconds left preserved Washington's lead[6]\n- **Scoring leaders**: Cade Cunningham had 38 points/10 rebounds for Detroit, while Justin Champagnie added 17 points/9 rebounds for Washington[3][6]\n\nThe outcome was confirmed across multiple verified sources including official NBA coverage[1], CBS Sports[3], and ESPN[6], with consistent reporting of the 129-125 final score. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation in any sources.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
