The ancillary data specifies that if the Maple Leafs win, it's p1; Flyers win, p2; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 26, 2025, the day after the game. So the event has already occurred. Now, I need to find out the result of that game from the provided search results. \n\nLooking through the sources, several articles mention the game's outcome. Search result [8] from The Hockey Writers is titled \"3 Takeaways From the Maple Leafs\u2019 7-2 Win Over the Flyers\" and states that Toronto won 7-2. Similarly, [9] from Northeast Now confirms the same score, with Nylander and Tavares each scoring twice. [11] and [12] also report the Leafs' 7-2 victory. \n\nAll these sources are consistent, indicating a clear win for the Maple Leafs. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the game was played and the Maple Leafs won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data. \n\nI need to ensure that the event in the query matches the sources. The date and teams align, so there's no confusion with another game. The Flyers' losing streak is noted in multiple articles, reinforcing the result. No conflicting information is present, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 7-2 in their NHL game on March 25, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[8][9][11][12]. The Maple Leafs dominated the game with William Nylander and John Tavares each contributing four points, while the Flyers extended their losing streak to six games. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the decisive outcome meets the resolution criteria specified.\n\n**Key details supporting the resolution:**\n- **Final score:** Toronto Maple Leafs 7, Philadelphia Flyers 2[9][11]\n- **Game date:** Played as scheduled on March 25, 2025[8][12]\n- **No postponement/cancellation:** The game concluded normally[12]\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the outcome of the NHL game between the Flyers and the Maple Leafs, which took place on March 25, 2025. The AI used multiple reliable sources to confirm that the Maple Leafs won the game 7-2. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Maple Leafs win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks the current date to confirm that the event has occurred and then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources. The AI ensures that the details of the event (date and teams involved) match the user prompt, confirming the validity of the sources used.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome through consistent information from several articles. It confirms that the game was not postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions for a resolution of p1 as per the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the facts and the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it accurately resolves the query based on the verified outcome of the event, adheres to the instructions, and logically processes the information without any observable errors or biases.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately identifies the outcome of the event, uses multiple reliable sources for verification, and aligns perfectly with the ancillary data and system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, adheres to the factual requirements, and logically concludes based on the evidence provided.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1743017677 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-26 19:34:37 UTC"
