The ancillary data specifies that if the Canadiens win, it's p2; if the Kraken win, p1; postponed keeps it open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 12, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, sources [1], [2], [3], and [6] all report the game between the Canadiens and Kraken on March 12, 2025. The scores from [1] show the Kraken won 5-4 in overtime. The ESPN game summary in [1] clearly states the final score as Kraken 5, Canadiens 4. \n\nFurther details in [2] and [3] mention Brandon Montour scoring the fastest overtime goal in NHL history just 4 seconds into OT, securing the Kraken's victory. The box score in [6] also confirms the Kraken's win. \n\nSince the game occurred on the scheduled date and wasn't postponed or canceled, the resolution depends on the winner. All sources agree the Kraken won, so the market should resolve to p1. There's no conflicting information, so no need to consider other outcomes. The answer is straightforward based on the search results provided.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Montreal Canadiens and Seattle Kraken on March 12, 2025, concluded with the **Seattle Kraken winning 5-4 in overtime**[1][2][3][6]. Brandon Montour scored the fastest overtime goal in NHL history (4 seconds into OT), securing the Kraken\u2019s comeback victory after overcoming a 4-2 deficit in the third period[2][3]. The game was played as scheduled, with no indication of postponement or cancellation in the sources.\n\n**Key details**:  \n- Final score: Kraken 5, Canadiens 4 (OT)  \n- Overtime goal scored 0:04 into the extra period by Brandon Montour[2][6]  \n- The game occurred on its originally scheduled date (March 12, 2025)[1][3]  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **Kraken** (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Canadiens vs. Kraken game on March 12, 2025) and verifies that it has occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). The AI then checks multiple sources to confirm the outcome of the game, which is that the Seattle Kraken won 5-4 in overtime. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Kraken win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and then verifies the outcome using multiple sources. The AI also correctly ignores the possibilities of postponement or cancellation since there is no indication of such events in the sources.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms the event's occurrence on the scheduled date and provides detailed information about the game's outcome, including the final score and the record-setting overtime goal. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Kraken\" (p1) is based on verified facts and is in full alignment with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI uses multiple sources to cross-verify the event's outcome, ensuring a reliable and unbiased resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets all the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation is based on concrete evidence and established facts, and it aligns perfectly with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and uses a logical reasoning process to verify the event's outcome and provide a recommendation based on established facts.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742922214 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:03:34 UTC",
