The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Sacramento Kings game on March 25, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Thunder win, it's p2 (\"Thunder\"), if the Kings win, p1 (\"Kings\"), and other conditions for postponement or cancellation. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm the game's date and time. The query mentions March 25 at 10:00 PM ET. The current date provided is March 26, 2025, so the game has already occurred. Now, I need to check the search results to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n- Result [1] mentions the Kings lost 121-105 to the Thunder on March 25.\n- Result [2] discusses the Thunder seeking their 60th win against the Kings on March 25. It also notes the Thunder's previous dominance over the Kings.\n- Result [3] states the Thunder earned their 60th win on March 25 against the Kings, confirming a victory.\n- Result [4] from ESPN lists the final score as Thunder 121, Kings 105.\n- Result [5] and [6] are video highlights but mention the Thunder's win and the final score.\n- Result [7] also confirms the Thunder's 121-105 victory.\n- Result [8] provides the box score, showing the Thunder won with a score of 121-105.\n\nAll sources consistently report the Thunder won the game. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Since the event date is in the past and multiple reliable sources confirm the Thunder's victory, the resolution should be p2 (\"Thunder\").\n</think>\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Sacramento Kings 121-105 on March 25, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources including ESPN[4], NBC Sports California[1], and Sports Illustrated[3]. The Thunder secured their 60th win of the season, matching their franchise record[3][4], while the Kings fell to 35-33[4]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander** led the Thunder with 32 points[4][7]\n- **Keegan Murray** scored 28 points for the Kings in the loss[1]\n- The Thunder extended their winning streak to seven games[3][7]\n- Oklahoma City dominated the season series 3-0 against Sacramento[2][3]\n\nThe game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1-8]. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **p2 (\"Thunder\")**.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Thunder win corresponds to a resolution of p2.\n\nThe response is logically sound and thorough in its approach. It checks the date and time of the event against the current timestamp to confirm that the game has already occurred. It then proceeds to verify the outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The AI also confirms that there were no indications of the game being postponed or canceled, which matches the conditions specified for resolution.\n\nThe recommendation of p2 (\"Thunder\") is directly aligned with the facts verified and the conditions outlined in the ancillary data. The response does not exhibit any missing information, bias, or errors. It strictly adheres to the instructions to report based on verified facts and to ensure that the resolution recommendation corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
