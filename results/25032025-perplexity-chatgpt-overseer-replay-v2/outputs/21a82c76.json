        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Mavericks vs. Rockets game scheduled for March 14, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Rockets win, it's p1; Mavericks win, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game actually happened on that date. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the game took place. For example, result [1] from ESPN details the Rockets' 133-96 victory over the Mavericks on March 14, 2025. Similarly, result [6] from CBS Sports confirms the same score and outcome. Both are reputable sports sources, so this seems reliable.\n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Result [10] mentions a postponed game from February 2021, which is irrelevant here. The current game in question is March 2025, and there's no indication in the provided search results of any postponement or cancellation for that specific date. All recent sources discuss the game as having occurred with a clear result.\n\nAdditionally, result [9] from a prediction article before the game also aligns with the actual outcome, where the Rockets were expected to win, which they did. The box scores in results [1] and [2] show the Rockets won 133-96, which is a decisive victory. \n\nThere's also a mention in result [4] about a game being postponed in 2021 due to weather, but that's a different year and not relevant to the 2025 game. The current game's date is March 14, 2025, and all sources point to it being played as scheduled. \n\nTherefore, since the game was played and the Rockets won, the resolution should be p1 according to the ancillary data provided. No conflicting information or indications of cancellation or postponement for this specific game exist in the search results.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets scheduled for March 14, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET **was played as planned**, with the Houston Rockets defeating the Dallas Mavericks **133-96**[1][6]. Key details from the game include:\n\n- **Rockets' Dominance**: Houston led by double digits for most of the game, with a 37-point third quarter extending their lead to 96-65[1]. Tari Eason scored a career-high 30 points, while Jalen Green added 23 points and nine rebounds[1][6].\n- **Mavericks' Struggles**: Dallas, missing multiple key players due to injuries, lost for the seventh time in eight games. Dante Exum sustained a season-ending broken left hand during the game[1][6].\n- **Postponement/Cancellation Status**: No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists for this specific March 14, 2025, game. A separate February 2021 game between these teams was postponed due to weather[4][10], but this is unrelated.\n\nSince the game occurred as scheduled and the Houston Rockets won decisively, the market resolves to **\"Rockets\"** per the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742929466 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:04:26 UTC"
