The ancillary data specifies that if the Hornets win, it's p1; Knicks win, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game date (March 20) is in the past. Now, I need to verify the game's outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game happened. Source [1] from ESPN states the Hornets won 115-98. Source [2] is a YouTube recap titled \"Hornets Defeat Road Weary Knicks 115-98,\" which aligns with the score. Source [5] from CBS Sports also mentions the Hornets' victory. Additionally, source [6] is a detailed game recap from a Hornets blog, and source [9] and [13] are video highlights confirming the Hornets' win. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Sources [4] and [8] discuss postponed games, but those are from January 2025, unrelated to the March 20 game. All relevant sources point to the game being played as scheduled with the Hornets winning. \n\nSince the event occurred and the Hornets won, the resolution should be p1. The ancillary data maps p1 to Hornets, so the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe New York Knicks and Charlotte Hornets played their scheduled NBA game on March 20, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The **Charlotte Hornets defeated the New York Knicks 115-98**, as confirmed by multiple sources including ESPN\u2019s game recap[1], MSG Networks\u2019 postgame analysis[2], and CBS Sports\u2019 box score[5]. LaMelo Ball led the Hornets with 25 points and eight assists, while five Charlotte players scored in double figures[1][6]. The Knicks, missing Jalen Brunson due to injury, struggled with fatigue and defensive execution, shooting just 10/39 from three-point range[6][9].  \n\nThe game was not postponed or canceled, and no conditions triggering a 50-50 resolution apply.  \n\n**recommendation: p1**",

It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event using multiple reliable sources, which all confirm that the Charlotte Hornets won the game. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Hornets win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response is logically sound and complete, as it checks for the occurrence of the game, confirms the outcome, and ensures that there were no conditions such as postponement or cancellation that would affect the resolution. The recommendation of p1 is based on verified facts that the Hornets won the game, and there is no indication of bias or error in the analysis.\n\nThe response also adheres strictly to the conditions outlined in the user prompt, focusing solely on the specific event mentioned and using the ancillary data to guide the resolution recommendation. There is no unnecessary information or deviation from the prompt's requirements.\n\nOverall, the response is accurate, complete, and adheres to the instructions provided.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.
