        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the North Carolina Central vs. Delaware State basketball game scheduled for March 13, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if North Carolina Central wins, the market resolves to them (p2), and if Delaware State wins, it resolves to them (p1). If postponed, it stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is March 25, 2025, which is after March 13, so the game should have happened. Looking at the search results, there are multiple sources confirming the game took place. Sources [1], [4], and [5] all report on the MEAC Tournament quarterfinal game on March 13, 2025, between these two teams. \n\nNext, I need to determine the outcome. According to [1], North Carolina Central won 79-77 with a last-second layup by Isaac Parson. Source [4] from ESPN corroborates this score and details, and [5] from Delaware State's own site also confirms the loss with the same score and mentions the buzzer-beater. \n\nThe user's resolution conditions are clear: a win by North Carolina Central means p2. All sources agree that NCCU won, so the market should resolve to p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable here. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. The other search results [2] and [8] discuss a previous game in February where Delaware State won in overtime, but that's a different game. The March 13th game is the one in question here, and all relevant sources confirm NCCU's victory. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p2 (North Carolina Central).\n</think>\n\nThe North Carolina Central Eagles defeated the Delaware State Hornets 79-77 in the MEAC Tournament quarterfinal on March 13, 2025. Isaac Parson scored the game-winning reverse layup with one second remaining after Martaz Robinson's tying three-pointer[1][4][5]. This outcome meets the resolution condition where a North Carolina Central victory triggers p2 (\"North Carolina Central\") resolution. The game was completed as scheduled with no indication of postponement or cancellation.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

It verifies that the event occurred as scheduled by checking multiple sources, which is in line with the requirement to use verified facts. The outcome of the game is reported consistently across multiple sources, confirming North Carolina Central's victory, which aligns with the resolution condition p2.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically proceeds from verifying the occurrence of the event to confirming its outcome. It checks for any possible postponements or cancellations, which is crucial for accurate resolution. The response also wisely checks for conflicting information, ensuring that the resolution is based on the correct event.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses multiple sources to verify the event's occurrence and outcome, which strengthens the reliability of the resolution. The alignment of the recommendation (p2) with the facts (North Carolina Central's win) is direct and correct based on the user prompt's resolution conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not include unnecessary information and focuses solely on the event in question, adhering strictly to the user prompt's instructions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt.

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
