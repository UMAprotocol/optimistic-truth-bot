        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Kings vs. Warriors game on March 13, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Warriors win, it's p1; Kings win, p2; postponed, stays open; canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game was on March 13, 2025. Sources like [15] (ESPN) and [14] (Fox Sports) confirm the game took place with a final score of Warriors 130, Kings 104. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nNext, verifying the result. Multiple sources, including [6], [10], [15], and [18], state the Warriors won. Stephen Curry's 4000th three-pointer is highlighted in [15] and [10], which adds credibility. The box score in [14] and play-by-play in [17] also support the Warriors' victory. \n\nCheck for any conflicting info. Some sources like [11] and [13] might have conflicting highlights, but looking closer, [11] seems to be a simulation, and [13] might be from a different game. The most reliable sources (ESPN, Fox Sports) consistently report the Warriors' win. \n\nSince the game occurred and the Warriors won, the resolution should be p1. No signs of cancellation or postponement, so p3 isn't needed. All conditions point to p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden State Warriors defeated the Sacramento Kings 130-104 on March 13, 2025, in a game that saw Stephen Curry make NBA history by becoming the first player to reach 4,000 career three-pointers[15][10]. The Warriors dominated throughout, shooting 56.4% from three-point range (22/39) and extending their winning streak to six games[15][14]. Key contributions came from Draymond Green (23 points) and Moses Moody (17 points), while the Kings struggled with Domantas Sabonis sidelined by injury[15][16].\n\nThe game proceeded as scheduled without postponement or cancellation[15][16], and all resolution conditions were met through on-court play. Based on the ancillary data parameters and verified outcome:\n\n**recommendation: p1**",

Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742927111 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:25:11 UTC"
