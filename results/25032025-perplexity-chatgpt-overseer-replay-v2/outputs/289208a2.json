        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said \"soft landing\" during his March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on whether he used that exact term, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2) or No (p1), with p3 as a fallback if uncertain.\n\nFirst, I'll check the provided search results. The key sources here are the transcripts from the press conference. Let's look through the search results that include the transcripts. \n\nSearch result [1] is a PDF transcript of the press conference. Skimming through the content, there's a mention of \"soft sentiment data\" but not \"soft landing.\" \n\nSearch result [3] is another transcript. On page 22, Powell says, \"Forecasting right now, it's you know, forecasting is always very, very hard, and in the current situation, I just think it's uncertainty is remarkably high.\" No mention of \"soft landing\" here. \n\nSearch result [13] is a transcript from the press briefing. In the Q&A section, a reporter asks about pivoting to rate cuts in May, and Powell responds about waiting for clarity. Another part of the transcript has Powell discussing uncertainty and policy stance, but again, no \"soft landing.\" \n\nSearch result [16] mentions Powell hinting at a soft landing in a February speech, but that's before March. Similarly, search result [17] from February has Powell dodging a question about a soft landing. \n\nLooking at the March 19 transcripts again, there's a section where Powell is asked about removing a line from the statement. He explains it wasn't a signal, just outdated language. No \"soft landing\" there. Another part of the transcript (search result [13]) has Powell talking about the economy being solid and waiting for clarity, but still no mention of the specific term.\n\nSince none of the March 19, 2025 transcripts or sources show Powell using \"soft landing,\" and the resolution conditions require the exact term, the answer should be No. The ancillary data specifies that any usage counts, but there's no evidence he did. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909182 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:26:22 UTC",
