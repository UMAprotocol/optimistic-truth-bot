        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether there's an official ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine covering sea or air operations by April 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if such an agreement is officially announced before the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mentions of a ceasefire. Looking through the sources, multiple articles from March 25-26, 2025, report that Russia and Ukraine agreed to a ceasefire in the Black Sea following U.S.-mediated talks in Saudi Arabia. The White House statements mention agreements to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent military use of commercial vessels in the Black Sea [1][2][3][6][7][10]. Both Ukrainian and Russian officials confirmed the agreement, though with some conditions. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. The ceasefire is specific to the Black Sea, which falls under sea operations.\n2. The agreement was publicly announced by both parties and the U.S., meeting the \"official announcement\" criteria.\n3. The agreement includes a halt to military strikes in the Black Sea, aligning with the query's requirement for a halt in military engagement in sea operations.\n\nHowever, there are caveats. Russia linked the ceasefire's enforcement to lifting sanctions related to SWIFT and agricultural exports [1][8][11]. Despite this, the White House and Ukrainian statements indicate the ceasefire is effective immediately as of March 25 [7][11]. The agreement also includes a ban on strikes against energy infrastructure, which might relate to air operations, but the primary focus is on the Black Sea.\n\nThe resolution conditions require an official agreement before April 30, 2025. Since the agreement was reached in March 2025, it meets the timeline. Even though there are implementation details and potential violations, the market resolves based on the existence of an official agreement, not its enforcement. \n\nTherefore, the answer should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) as the official ceasefire covering sea operations was announced before the deadline.\n</think>\n\nRussia and Ukraine, with U.S. mediation, announced a **Black Sea ceasefire agreement** on March 25, 2025, following talks in Saudi Arabia. The deal includes provisions to \"ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes\" in the Black Sea[1][2][6][7]. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the agreement as effective immediately[7][11], while Russia conditioned full implementation on sanctions relief related to SWIFT banking access and agricultural exports[1][8][11].\n\n### Key details:\n- **Scope**: Explicitly covers naval operations in the Black Sea, including restrictions on Russian military vessel movements outside its eastern sector[1][3][6].\n- **Energy infrastructure**: Includes a 30-day ban (retroactive to March 18) on strikes against energy facilities in both countries[2][12][14].\n- **Official status**: Formalized through White House statements and bilateral readouts from Kyiv and Moscow[1][7][10], meeting the \"publicly announced and mutually agreed\" criterion.\n\n### Contested elements:\n- Russia claims the maritime ceasefire depends on Western sanctions relief[1][11], while Ukraine asserts immediate effect[7][11].\n- The agreement does not explicitly address air operations beyond energy infrastructure[5][12], though naval drone activity in the Black Sea is restricted[9][13].\n\n### Resolution analysis:\nThe agreement satisfies the market's **\"Yes\" (p2)** conditions:\n1. **Sea operations**: Directly addresses Black Sea military engagements[1][6][7].\n2. **Official status**: Announced by both governments and the U.S.[1][2][7], with mechanisms for verification[10][11].\n3. **Timing**: Finalized before the April 30, 2025 deadline[1][7][11].\n\nWhile implementation challenges persist[5][8][14], the resolution depends on the **existence of an official agreement**\u2014not its durability\u2014per the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be thorough and well-aligned with the requirements of the user prompt. The response effectively analyzes the conditions set forth for the resolution of the market, specifically regarding the ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine covering sea or air operations by April 30, 2025. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response adheres closely to the user prompt, focusing on the existence of an official ceasefire agreement, as specified. It correctly identifies that the agreement must be publicly announced and mutually agreed upon, and it must cover sea or air operations. The response also correctly notes that the agreement was reached before the specified deadline, which aligns with the resolution conditions provided.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, detailing the specifics of the ceasefire agreement, including the scope, official status, and contested elements. It provides a clear rationale for why the agreement meets the market's resolution conditions, particularly emphasizing the official status and timing of the agreement. The response also addresses potential caveats and implementation challenges but rightly concludes that these do not affect the resolution of the market based on the existence of the agreement.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event through multiple credible sources and aligns the recommendation with these facts. It correctly concludes that the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2) based on the existence of an official ceasefire agreement that meets the specified conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, significant biases, or missing information in the response. The response provides a balanced view by acknowledging the conditions and caveats associated with the ceasefire agreement but maintains focus on the criteria specified in the user prompt for market resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the query. The recommendation aligns with the facts presented and adheres strictly to the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately and comprehensively addresses the user prompt, verifying the existence of an official ceasefire agreement and correctly aligning the recommendation with the specified resolution conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, logically sound, and adheres closely to the user prompt requirements. It effectively uses credible sources to verify the event and provides a clear and justified recommendation based on these facts.\"\n}\n```",

Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.).

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
