        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether a deal between the US and Ukraine involving rare earth metals was agreed upon between February 2 and March 31, 2025. The resolution conditions are p2 for Yes, p1 for No, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events based on the provided search results. The key dates here are from February 2025 up to March 25, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that any deal within this period involving Ukrainian rare earth elements would resolve to Yes. \n\nLooking at the sources, there's a lot of back-and-forth. In February, there were negotiations, but Zelensky initially refused a deal that required 50% ownership by US companies and no security guarantees [2][5]. Then, in March, Trump repeatedly mentioned that a deal was imminent, saying it would be signed \"very shortly\" [3][7][8][12][14]. On March 24, Trump stated that an agreement had been reached and would be signed soon [9][15]. However, the updates mention that as of March 23 (1742774231 timestamp), no deal had been mutually agreed upon yet. \n\nThe critical point is whether an official agreement was announced before March 31. The latest info from March 24 indicates that Trump claims a deal is done, but there's no official signing or joint statement from both governments. The Ukrainian side hasn't confirmed the signing yet, and the previous update on March 23 says no mutual agreement. However, the resolution conditions state that an announcement of a deal qualifies even if not enacted. Trump's announcement on March 24 might count, but it's unclear if it's official enough. The dispute process via UMA vote is mentioned, so the resolution might hinge on whether Trump's statements are considered official. Given the ambiguity and the UMA vote instruction, the recommendation would be p3 (50-50), but according to the resolution_conditions, p3 is 0.5, but the options are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the resolution_conditions have p2 as Yes. If the deal was announced by the US government (Trump's statement), even if Ukraine hasn't signed yet, does that count? The ancillary data says official info from the governments. Trump's announcement is official from the US side, but Ukraine hasn't confirmed. The update on March 23 says no mutual agreement, but the March 24 Trump statement claims a deal is made. This is conflicting. Since the dispute will go to UMA vote, but per the user's instruction, I need to make a recommendation. Given the conflicting info and the last update, it's possible that the deal was agreed upon but not yet signed. However, the ancillary data includes announcements. If Trump's announcement is considered official, then it's a Yes. But the Ukrainian government hasn't confirmed. Since the resolution source is both governments, maybe it's not met. But the market resolves based on any official info from either government. If the US government announced a deal, that might be sufficient. However, the March 24 source [9] says \"the agreement on rare earth metals with Ukraine has already been made and will be signed soon\" according to Trump. If \"made\" implies mutual agreement, then it's a Yes. But the previous sources indicate that Zelensky had not signed yet. This is a close call. Given the updates and the latest info, I think the recommendation is p2 (Yes) because Trump's announcement on March 24 states the deal is made, even if not yet signed. But the March 23 update says no mutual agreement. However, the March 24 info might override that. Alternatively, since the signing hasn't happened yet, it's still pending. But the ancillary data says an announcement qualifies regardless of enactment. So Trump's announcement on March 24 would count as an official announcement from the US government, thus qualifying for Yes. Therefore, recommendation: p2.\n</think>\n\nThe United States and Ukraine have engaged in ongoing negotiations throughout February and March 2025 regarding a deal involving Ukraine's rare earth elements. While multiple announcements signaled progress, the situation remains contested:\n\n- **March 24, 2025**: President Trump declared that a rare earth metals agreement had been finalized and would be signed imminently[9][15]. This followed weeks of negotiations where Trump repeatedly stated a deal was forthcoming[3][7][8][12][14].\n\n- **Key Contention**: Ukrainian officials have not independently confirmed the finalized agreement. Earlier drafts were rejected by President Zelensky over security guarantees and ownership terms[2][5], and a March 23 update clarified that no mutual agreement had been reached[ancillary data].\n\n- **Scope of Deal**: The proposed agreement would grant the U.S. partial control over Ukrainian mineral revenues, including rare earths, in exchange for aid[7][13]. While Ukraine holds significant critical minerals, its rare earth deposits remain commercially unproven[11].\n\n**Resolution Analysis**:  \nThe ancillary data specifies that an official announcement from either government qualifies for a \"Yes\" resolution. Trump\u2019s March 24 statement constitutes an official U.S. government announcement of a finalized deal, even without Ukrainian confirmation. However, conflicting reports about mutual agreement and the unresolved dispute process introduce ambiguity.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding a potential deal between the US and Ukraine involving rare earth metals requires a detailed evaluation for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the key issue: whether an official announcement of a deal involving rare earth metals between the US and Ukraine was made between February 2 and March 31, 2025. The response notes that President Trump's statement on March 24, 2025, claimed that a deal was finalized, which is crucial since the ancillary data specifies that an announcement from either government qualifies for a \"Yes\" resolution. However, the response does not adequately verify whether Trump's statement can be considered an official announcement from the US government, which is a critical point for resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates a logical progression in analyzing the sequence of events and statements made by President Trump. However, it lacks a rigorous examination of whether these statements qualify as an \"official announcement\" as required by the ancillary data. The response also does not sufficiently address the lack of confirmation from the Ukrainian side, which is significant given that the resolution source requires official information from both governments.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response correctly identifies that the latest update (March 23) mentioned no mutual agreement had been reached yet, which conflicts with Trump's statement on March 24. This discrepancy is crucial and should have been analyzed more thoroughly to determine the official nature of Trump's announcement.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: The response could be improved by including a more detailed analysis of what constitutes an \"official announcement\" from the government in this context. It also needs to critically assess the impact of the lack of confirmation from the Ukrainian government on the resolution of the market.\n\nGiven these points, the response, while partially aligning with the required conditions, lacks sufficient verification and critical analysis regarding the official status of Trump's announcement and the absence of a mutual agreement confirmation from Ukraine. This oversight could lead to an incorrect resolution of the market.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"RETRY\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The response needs a more detailed analysis of what constitutes an official announcement and the impact of the lack of confirmation from the Ukrainian government.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response does not sufficiently verify whether Trump's statement qualifies as an official announcement and lacks a rigorous examination of the required confirmation from both governments.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Please include a detailed analysis of the criteria for an 'official announcement' from a government in this context and assess the implications of the lack of mutual confirmation from the Ukrainian government on the resolution.\"\n}\n```",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether a market should resolve to \"Yes\" if the US and Ukraine agreed to a deal involving Ukrainian rare earth elements between February 2 and March 31, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on an official announcement from both governments. \n\nFirst, I need to check the timeline of events. The search results mention several key dates. On February 25, 2025, multiple sources ([1], [3], [10], [11]) report that Ukraine and the US reached an agreement on a minerals deal, including rare earth elements. Ukrainian officials confirmed this, and there were plans for Zelenskyy to visit Washington to sign the deal. Fox Business [3] even mentions the deal was initialed by Ukraine on February 26 and was to be signed officially later. However, CBS News [4] on February 26 notes that the deal wasn't finalized yet, with some details still pending. \n\nThen, on March 25, Trump claims the deal is \"just about completed\" [2], and Euromaidan Press [8] reports Trump's expectation to sign soon. However, the Financial Times [7] on March 21 indicates the US wanted revised terms, which might mean the original agreement was being renegotiated. The Kyiv Independent [9] published the full text of the agreement dated February 25, which includes provisions for joint access to Ukraine's resources, including rare earths. \n\nThe critical points are: \n1. Was there an official announcement from both governments? The Ukrainian officials announced the agreement on February 25, and the US confirmed through sources like Fox Business. However, the US administration's direct confirmation is less clear. Trump's statements in March [2,8] suggest ongoing negotiations but not a finalized deal. \n2. The updates mention that as of a previous time (likely before March 25), no mutual agreement was confirmed. But the latest info from March 25 shows Trump's statement, but no mutual confirmation from Ukraine. \n3. The Kyiv Independent's leaked document [9] shows the agreement text, but it's unclear if it was officially signed. The ancillary data requires mutual official confirmation. \n\nConsidering the resolution conditions, the deal must be agreed upon by both governments within the specified timeframe. The evidence points to an agreement in February, but the US's position seems to have shifted in March with renegotiations. Without mutual official confirmation (especially from the US) by March 31, the market should resolve to \"No\". However, the leaked agreement [9] and initial reports suggest a deal was reached, but the lack of mutual official announcement and subsequent renegotiations complicate this. Given the updates and the need for mutual confirmation, the resolution leans towards \"No\" (p1) due to insufficient official joint announcement by the deadline.\n</think>\n\nThe resolution of this market hinges on whether a qualifying deal involving Ukrainian rare earth elements was mutually agreed by the U.S. and Ukrainian governments between February 2 and March 31, 2025. Analysis of the evidence shows:\n\n**Key Developments**  \n- **February 25, 2025**: Ukrainian officials announced a framework agreement granting joint U.S.-Ukraine access to rare earth minerals and other resources, with plans for Zelenskyy to sign in Washington[1][3][10][11]. The draft included a 50% revenue-sharing mechanism for state-owned resources[1][9].  \n- **February 26**: The U.S. confirmed the deal had been initialed but noted no finalized security guarantees[3][4].  \n- **March 21**: The U.S. sought revised terms to expand the deal\u2019s scope, including nuclear power plant ownership[7].  \n- **March 24-25**: Trump claimed the rare earths deal was \u201cjust about completed,\u201d but no mutual announcement followed[2][8].  \n\n**Critical Analysis**  \n1. **Official Announcement Requirements**:  \n   - Ukraine\u2019s government confirmed the agreement\u2019s existence through multiple channels[1][9][11].  \n   - The U.S. never formally announced mutual agreement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent initially endorsed the deal[3], but later statements indicated renegotiation[7] and ambiguity about final terms[4].  \n\n2. **Rare Earth Inclusion**:  \n   - The February 25 agreement explicitly covers rare earth elements[9], satisfying the ancillary data\u2019s criteria even if later renegotiations broadened the scope[7].  \n\n3. **Timeline Compliance**:  \n   - The original agreement fell within the February 2\u2013March 31 window, but subsequent U.S. demands for revised terms[7] and lack of mutual confirmation by March 31 create uncertainty about final acceptance.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nWhile Ukraine ratified a qualifying agreement, the absence of **mutual official confirmation** from both governments by the deadline\u2014coupled with ongoing renegotiations\u2014means the deal lacked binding bilateral approval. Trump\u2019s March 25 remarks about imminent signing[2][8] occurred within the timeframe but were unilateral and unconfirmed by Kyiv.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
