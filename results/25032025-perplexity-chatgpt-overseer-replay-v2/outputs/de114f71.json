        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump issued an executive order on March 15, 2025, based on the provided search results. The resolution conditions specify that the answer must be \"Yes\" if the order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or the press pool by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I'll check the search results for any mention of March 15. Looking through the sources, result [7] is a White House page dated March 15, 2025, titled \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua.\" The content includes a proclamation by President Trump under the Alien Enemies Act, which is a type of executive action. \n\nWait, the query says \"executive actions will not qualify,\" so I need to confirm if this is an executive order. The source [7] refers to it as a proclamation, but the user's resolution conditions require an executive order. However, looking at the Federal Register's definition, executive orders and proclamations are both presidential documents. But the user specified that executive actions don't count. Hmm.\n\nWait, the ancillary data says \"executive actions will not qualify,\" so maybe proclamations are considered different. But in the Federal Register, executive orders and proclamations are both under presidential documents. However, the user's market resolution is based on whether it's published as an executive order on the White House page. The source [7] is a presidential action page, and the document is a proclamation. The market's resolution conditions might consider proclamations as separate from executive orders. \n\nBut looking at the search results again, result [11] mentions an executive order signed on March 14, 2025, published on March 15. The article from RFE/RL states that Trump signed an executive order on March 14 targeting seven agencies, including USAGM. However, the publication date is March 15. The user's condition requires the order to be published by 12 PM ET the day after. If the order was signed on March 14 but published on March 15, does that count? The query says \"issued on March 15,\" but the signing date is the 14th. However, the publication date on the White House page is what matters. \n\nWait, result [11] says the executive order was signed late on March 14 and published on March 15. The White House page (source [2]) lists presidential actions, and on March 15, there's an entry for \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act...\" which is a proclamation. The RFE/RL article (source [11]) refers to an executive order signed on March 14, published on March 15. The user's resolution condition is based on the publication date. So if the order was published on March 15, even if signed the day before, it would count. \n\nBut the user's query specifies \"issued on March 15.\" The term \"issued\" might refer to the date it's published. The Federal Register's executive orders are dated by when they're signed, but the White House page lists them by publication. The ancillary data says to use the Federal Register as the resolution source in case of ambiguity. \n\nLooking at the Federal Register (source [3] and [8]), there's no mention of an executive order on March 15. The latest mentioned in the search results is EO 14238 from March 14 (source [4]). The RFE/RL article's EO from March 14 would be published on March 15, but the Federal Register might list it with the signing date. Since the user's condition defaults to the Federal Register in case of ambiguity, and if the EO was signed on the 14th, it would be listed under that date. Therefore, no EO issued on March 15. \n\nBut wait, the user's market resolves based on publication on the White House page. The RFE/RL article's EO was published on March 15 on the White House page. However, the search result [2] (White House presidential actions) for March 15 lists \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act...\" which is a proclamation, not an executive order. The other EO mentioned in [11] might not be listed on the White House page for March 15. The user's search results don't show the March 14 EO on the White House page for March 15. Therefore, the only March 15 action is the proclamation, which doesn't count. Hence, the answer should be \"No,\" p1. But wait, the RFE/RL article says the EO was signed on March 14 and published on March 15. If it's on the White House page on March 15, then it should count. However, in the provided search results, the White House page (source [2]) as of March 25 doesn't list an EO on March 15. The March 15 entry is the proclamation. Therefore, no EO published on March 15. Hence, the resolution is \"No,\" p1.\n</think>\n\nBased on the search results, President Trump signed an executive order on March 14, 2025, targeting seven federal agencies including the US Agency for Global Media[11]. However, this order was published on March 15, 2025[11], which meets the market's resolution criteria of requiring publication by 12:00 PM ET the day after the listed date (March 15). The White House presidential actions page shows a March 15 entry for the \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua,\" but this is categorized as a proclamation rather than an executive order[7].\n\nThe key distinction lies in the ancillary data's requirement that executive actions (including proclamations) don't qualify, and the Federal Register's classification system where executive orders and proclamations are separate document types[3][8]. While the March 14 executive order was published on March 15, the market specifically requires an executive order to be **issued** on March 15 rather than merely published afterward. The Federal Register resolution source shows no executive orders dated March 15[3][8], only the March 14 order published in subsequent records[4][11].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response to the UMA optimistic oracle request regarding whether Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 15, 2025, is largely accurate and adheres well to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response demonstrates a thorough analysis of the available information and correctly interprets the user prompt's requirements and conditions for resolution.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies that the key issue is whether an executive order was issued on March 15, 2025, and not merely signed or announced on that date. It correctly distinguishes between different types of presidential actions (executive orders vs. proclamations) and adheres to the user prompt's stipulation that only executive orders count towards the market's resolution. The response also correctly uses the specified URLs for verification, aligning with the prompt's requirement to base the resolution on these sources.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, detailing the investigation into both the proclamation and the executive order mentioned in the sources. It correctly concludes that the proclamation does not meet the criteria for resolution and that the executive order, although signed on March 14 and published on March 15, does not qualify as being \"issued\" on March 15 as per the Federal Register's records. This reasoning is sound and aligns with the user prompt's definitions and conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response effectively verifies the events using the specified URLs and aligns its recommendation with the facts found. It concludes that no executive order was issued on March 15, which is consistent with the information from the Federal Register and the White House presidential actions page.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no significant errors or biases in the response. The AI has correctly interpreted and applied the information from the sources provided in the user prompt. It has also adhered strictly to the definitions and conditions specified for resolving the market.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the query.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742924102 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 17:35:02 UTC",
