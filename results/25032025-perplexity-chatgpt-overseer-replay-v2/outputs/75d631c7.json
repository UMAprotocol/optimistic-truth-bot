The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the New Jersey Devils vs. Columbus Blue Jackets game scheduled for March 17, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Devils win, it's p2 (Devils), Blue Jackets win is p1, postponed stays open, and canceled resolves to p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date is March 25, 2025, so the game is in the past. Looking at the search results, multiple sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) report that the game took place on March 17, 2025. The Devils won 2-1. \n\nNext, confirm the result. All sources agree the Devils scored two goals in the second period, and the Blue Jackets got one in the third. The final score was 2-1 in favor of New Jersey. No mentions of the game being postponed or canceled. \n\nCheck the resolution conditions: Since the Devils won, the market should resolve to p2. The ancillary data doesn't mention any other conditions affecting the outcome. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe New Jersey Devils defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 2-1 in their NHL game on March 17, 2025. Timo Meier and Jesper Bratt scored 39 seconds apart in the second period, while Jake Allen made a season-high 45 saves to secure the win[1][2][4]. Mathieu Olivier's third-period goal for Columbus ended a 182:55 scoring drought but wasn't enough to overcome the deficit[1][5].\n\nAccording to the resolution conditions:\n- **Devils win** triggers resolution to \"Devils\" (p2)\n- The game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][6]\n- All sources confirm the final score and outcome[3][4][5]\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742909701 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 13:35:01 UTC"
