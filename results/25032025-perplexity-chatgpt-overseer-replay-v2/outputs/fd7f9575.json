        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Lakers vs. Nuggets game on March 14, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Lakers win, it's p2 (Lakers), if the Nuggets win, p1 (Nuggets), and if canceled, p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the game's date and outcome. The current date given is March 25, 2025, so the game on March 14 has already happened. Looking at the search results, result [1] from ESPN shows the final score as Nuggets 131-126 Lakers on March 14. That's a clear Nuggets win. \n\nI should verify other sources to ensure consistency. Result [6] is a YouTube video titled \"Lakers vs Denver Nuggets - Full Game Highlights | March 14, 2025\" from House of Highlights, which likely covers the same game. Result [7] mentions a wild ending where Jamal Murray hits a clutch 3-pointer for the Nuggets, leading to their victory. \n\nAdditionally, result [16] from RotoWire lists the Nuggets as winners with a 122.5-109.0 score, but the ESPN result [1] is more direct and specific. There's a discrepancy in the scores here, but multiple sources confirm the Nuggets won. \n\nSince the game wasn't postponed or canceled, and the Nuggets won, the resolution should be p1. I need to make sure there's no conflicting information. Result [13] talks about a Lakers win on February 22, but that's a different game. The March 14 game is clearly covered in results [1], [6], [7], and [16], all pointing to a Nuggets victory. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to p1 (Nuggets). No signs of cancellation or postponement, so p3 isn't applicable. All conditions are met for p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers faced the Denver Nuggets on March 14, 2025, at 9:30 PM ET. According to the **ESPN game recap**[1], the **Denver Nuggets won 131-126**, with Jamal Murray hitting a clutch 3-pointer in the final minutes to secure the victory. The Lakers were short-handed, missing LeBron James (groin injury) and Luka Don\u010di\u0107 (inactive for the game)[5][16], while the Nuggets had their full roster available, including Nikola Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray[1][7].\n\n### Key Details:\n- **Final Score**: Nuggets 131, Lakers 126[1].\n- **Notable Performances**:\n  - Jamal Murray (Nuggets): 23 points, including a critical 3-pointer in the closing minutes[7].\n  - Luka Don\u010di\u0107 (Lakers): Did not play due to injury[16].\n  - Nikola Joki\u0107 (Nuggets): Dominated with 34 points, 8 rebounds, and 4 assists[5].\n\n### Market Resolution:\nSince the **Denver Nuggets won the game**, the market resolves to **p1 (Nuggets)**. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up date was required. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742926353 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 18:12:33 UTC"
