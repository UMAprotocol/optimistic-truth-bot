        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Bucks vs. Lakers game on March 20, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Bucks win, it's p2 (Bucks), Lakers win p1 (Lakers), postponed stays open, canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game recap from March 20, 2025, on ESPN [1], which confirms the game took place. The result was a Bucks victory with a score of 118-89. Multiple sources like CBS Sports [2] and Fox Sports [6] also report the same score, reinforcing the outcome. \n\nNext, I need to ensure there's no confusion with other games. The sources refer to the March 20 game specifically, so no mix-up there. The Lakers were short-handed, missing key players like LeBron James and Luka Don\u010di\u0107, but that doesn't affect the resolution since the market only cares about the final result regardless of team circumstances. \n\nThe resolution conditions don't mention anything about player availability or margin of victory, just who won. The Bucks clearly won, so the market should resolve to p2. There's no indication the game was postponed or canceled; all sources confirm it occurred. \n\nI should also check for any conflicting information. All sources align on the Bucks' win, so no discrepancies. The YouTube video [7] analysis also discusses the Lakers' loss, supporting the outcome. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2: Bucks.\n</think>\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 118-89 on March 20, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][6][7]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Despite the Lakers missing key players including LeBron James and Luka Don\u010di\u0107 due to injuries[1][2], the outcome stands under the resolution criteria which focus solely on the final result rather than roster circumstances. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 28 points[1][2]\n- Gary Trent Jr. contributed 23 points off the bench[1]\n- Bronny James scored a career-high 17 points for the Lakers[1][7]\n\nThe ancillary data specifies resolution to \"Bucks\" (p2) for a Milwaukee victory. Since the game concluded normally and the Bucks won decisively, the market resolves accordingly.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.
