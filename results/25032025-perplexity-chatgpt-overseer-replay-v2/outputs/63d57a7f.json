The ancillary data specifies that if USC wins, the market resolves to \"USC\" (p2), if Rutgers wins, it's \"Rutgers\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on or before the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 12, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5]) report that USC defeated Rutgers 97-89 in a double-overtime game during the Big Ten Tournament on March 12, 2025. For example, source [1] states, \"The Trojans defeated the Scarlet Knights 97-89 to move on to the second round of the Big Ten Tournament.\" Similarly, source [5] from ESPN confirms the final score as USC 97-89 Rutgers. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources indicate the game took place as scheduled with a clear result. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since USC won, the market should resolve to p2 (\"USC\"). \n\nI should also check if there are any conflicting reports, but all sources consistently report USC's victory. No sources suggest a different outcome or cancellation. Thus, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe USC vs. Rutgers men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 8:30 PM ET occurred as planned. According to multiple verified sources, **USC defeated Rutgers 97-89 in a double-overtime thriller** during the first round of the Big Ten Tournament[1][2][3][4][5]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the result was decisively determined by the final score.  \n\n**Key details:**  \n- USC entered as the 14th seed, Rutgers as the 11th seed[1][3].  \n- The Trojans led 41-30 at halftime but faced a Rutgers comeback in the second half, forcing overtime[1][4].  \n- USC\u2019s Desmond Claude scored 28 points, including 10 in overtime, to secure the win[4][5].  \n- The game concluded without cancellations or unresolved contingencies[1][2][3][4][5].  \n\nSince USC won the game, the market resolves to **p2 (\"USC\")** per the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

It correctly identifies that the event (USC vs. Rutgers CBB game) occurred in the past relative to the current timestamp and verifies the outcome using multiple sources. The response does not predict future outcomes or speculate but sticks to verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It checks the date of the event, confirms it has occurred, and verifies the outcome through multiple sources. The reasoning is clear, and the response is complete as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the event's outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the USC vs. Rutgers game occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It confirms USC's victory, which aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt that specifies the market should resolve to \"USC\" (p2) if USC wins. The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the event.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors in the Response**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring reliability and reducing the risk of bias.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, logical reasoning, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742930058 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 19:14:18 UTC"
