The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, the market resolves to \"Utah\" (p2), if the Canucks win, it's \"Canucks\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date, which is March 25, 2025. The game was on March 16, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, multiple articles ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8]) report that Utah won the game 3-1. For example, source [2] states, \"Utah HC Defeat Canucks 3-1,\" and [3] mentions \"Cooley breaks tie in 3rd, Utah defeats Canucks.\" The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all sources discuss the game happening as scheduled. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed. All results confirm Utah's victory. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Utah). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All sources align on the 3-1 score in favor of Utah. The Canucks' loss is also discussed in [8], where their captain comments on the missed opportunity. No sources suggest a different outcome. \n\nSince the event occurred, and Utah won, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Utah Hockey Club and Vancouver Canucks on March 16, 2025, concluded with a **3-1 victory for Utah**. Multiple sources confirm Logan Cooley scored the game-winning goal in the third period, followed by Clayton Keller\u2019s empty-net goal to seal the result[1][2][3][4]. The Canucks\u2019 lone goal came from Quinn Hughes on a power play in the second period[3][4]. \n\nThe game was played as scheduled, with no indications of postponement or cancellation. Utah\u2019s win narrowed their gap in the Western Conference wild-card race, tying them with the Calgary Flames at 71 points, while Vancouver remained at 73 points[2][8]. \n\n**Resolution**: The market resolves to **p2 (Utah)** based on their confirmed victory.  \nrecommendation: p2",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response accurately identifies the event (Utah vs. Canucks NHL game on March 16, 2025) and correctly notes that the game has already occurred as of the current timestamp (March 25, 2025). The outcome of the game is reported with specific details, including the final score and key players involved, which aligns with the user prompt's requirement for factual verification.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information from the user prompt and the ancillary data. It correctly interprets the conditions for market resolution (p2 for Utah win, p1 for Canucks win, p3 for cancellation). The reasoning is thorough, checking for any possible cancellations or postponements and confirming the game's occurrence and outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources, as mentioned in the narrative. It aligns the recommendation (p2 for Utah's win) directly with the verified outcome, adhering to the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response does not exhibit any deviation from the facts or the user prompt's requirements.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the verified outcome of the event, and there is no contradictory information or unverified claims.\n\nDecision:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data conditions without any factual errors or logical inconsistencies.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event's outcome and adheres closely to the user prompt's instructions for resolution based on verified facts.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.
