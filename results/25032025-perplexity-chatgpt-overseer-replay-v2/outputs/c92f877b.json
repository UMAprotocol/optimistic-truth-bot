        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Million\" 10 or more times during his DOJ speech on March 14, 2025. The resolution depends on counting the exact term \"Million\" (including plurals or possessives) in his spoken words during the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for transcripts or mentions of the speech. Looking through the sources, there are several transcripts and articles about the speech. \n\nSearch result [1] is a YouTube transcript snippet. I'll scan for \"million.\" The text mentions \"nearly 1 million deadly doses of fentol\" [1][7]. That's one instance. \n\nSearch result [2] is a Rev.com transcript. Looking through the quotes, Trump talks about firing Biden-appointed attorneys but doesn't mention \"million\" here. \n\nSearch result [3] from Axios discusses the planned speech but doesn't include the actual content. \n\nSearch result [4] from CBS News mentions the speech's content, including seizing nearly 1 million doses of fentanyl [4][7]. That's the same instance as in [1]. \n\nSearch result [5] from PBS has a transcript snippet but no mention of \"million.\" \n\nSearch result [7] (another YouTube transcript) includes \"1 million deadly doses of fentol\" [7]. Same as before. \n\nSearch result [9] from Politico quotes Trump but doesn't mention \"million.\" \n\nSearch result [16] from ABC News also references the fentanyl seizure of nearly 1 million doses [16]. \n\nOther sources like [8], [10]-[15] don't relate to the speech content. \n\nSo, in the available transcripts, \"million\" is used once in reference to fentanyl doses. No other instances are found. The user requires 10+ mentions for \"Yes.\" Since only one occurrence is found across all sources, the answer should resolve to \"No.\" The event occurred as scheduled, so no cancellation issues. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Here is the detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event (Donald Trump's DOJ speech on March 14, 2025) and adheres to the user prompt's requirement to count the occurrences of the word \"Million\" in any form during the speech. The AI checks multiple sources for transcripts and mentions of the speech, ensuring that the term's usage is counted accurately. The response adheres to the instruction to resolve based on the event occurring and not being canceled.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The AI's reasoning process is logical and thorough. It systematically checks various sources for instances of the word \"Million\" and correctly identifies that the term was mentioned only once in the context of \"nearly 1 million deadly doses of fentanyl.\" This is cross-referenced with multiple sources to avoid double-counting the same instance. The AI concludes that since the term was not mentioned 10 or more times, the market should resolve to \"No.\"\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI confirms that the event occurred as scheduled and was not canceled. It bases its resolution on verified transcripts and news reports, aligning the recommendation (p1) with the factual occurrence of the event and the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI effectively uses the provided URLs and sources to gather information about the speech and adheres strictly to the terms outlined for resolution.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory. It is accurate, complete, logically reasoned, and adheres strictly to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The recommendation aligns with the facts as verified from reliable sources.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately counts the occurrences of the term 'Million' as specified, verifies the event occurred, and aligns the recommendation with the factual data and user prompt conditions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to verify the single occurrence of the term and correctly concludes based on the evidence provided.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742916755 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 15:32:35 UTC",
