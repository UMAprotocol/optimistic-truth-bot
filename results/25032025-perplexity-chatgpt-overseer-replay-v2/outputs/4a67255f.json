        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said the word \"China\" during his March 19, 2025 FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on whether he used that exact word in his introductory statement or the Q&A session. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of \"China\" in the transcripts or related materials from that specific event. The key sources here are the transcripts from the March 19 press conference (sources [9], [10], [12], [13], [17]). \n\nLooking at source [9], the PDF transcript of Powell's press conference on March 19, 2025, there's a section where Powell discusses trade policy and mentions China. Specifically, he refers to trade being \"spread around the, you know\u2014it\u2019s not as concentrated in China as it was. There was a lot more manufacturing. It moved to Mexico and other places.\" This directly includes the word \"China.\"\n\nAdditionally, source [10] is a YouTube video of the press conference. The transcript excerpt there mentions Powell talking about trade policy changes and the uncertainty around their effects, though the exact word \"China\" isn't in the provided snippet. However, the full video might have more context, but since the user provided a transcript excerpt, I rely on that.\n\nSource [13] is an article discussing Powell's press conference. It notes that Powell used the word \"transitory\" in the context of tariffs and inflation, and mentions that tariffs on China were part of the discussion. However, the article's transcript excerpt doesn't include Powell saying \"China\" himself. \n\nSource [17] is a BBVA Research report stating that Powell mentioned the impact of policy changes, including trade, but doesn't explicitly cite the word \"China\" in their summary.\n\nThe critical evidence is in source [9], where Powell explicitly mentions China in the context of trade distribution. Since the resolution conditions state that any usage of the word, regardless of context, counts, this confirms that \"China\" was indeed said during the press conference. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742917980 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-25 15:53:00 UTC",
