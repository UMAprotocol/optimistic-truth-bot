The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the CSU Northridge vs. Stanford basketball game scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 11:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Stanford wins, it's p1; if CSU Northridge wins, p2; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided current date is March 19, 2025, 4:03:25 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for March 18 at 11:00 PM ET, which is March 19 in UTC (since ET is UTC-4 or UTC-5 depending on daylight saving). So the game's scheduled time has already passed.\n\nNext, I look at the search results to determine the outcome. Multiple sources ([1], [4], [5], [8]) report that Stanford won the game 87-70. For example, source [1] states, \"Maxime Raynaud has 22 points, 11 rebounds as Stanford secures 87-70 win over CSU Northridge in NIT.\" Similarly, source [8] confirms Stanford's victory and their advancement to the next round. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Source [2] talks about a baseball game cancellation, which is unrelated. All relevant sources indicate the game was played as scheduled, with a clear result. \n\nSince the event occurred, and Stanford won, the resolution should be p1. No conflicting information or cancellations are present. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nStanford defeated CSU Northridge 87-70 in their NIT first-round game on March 18, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][4][8]. The Cardinal led wire-to-wire behind Maxime Raynaud's 22-point, 11-rebound double-double and Oziyah Sellers' 20-point performance[1][8]. CSUN's season ended with a 22-11 record despite 18 points from Keonte Jones[4][5]. The game was completed as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation mentioned in any reports[1][4][8].\n\nrecommendation: p1",

It then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event through multiple sources, confirming that Stanford won the game. The response aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which specifies that a Stanford win should resolve as p1.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it methodically checks the date of the event against the current date to ensure the event has passed. It then confirms the outcome through reliable sources, ensuring that the information is specific to the event in question and not related to any other events. The response also correctly ignores unrelated information (such as the mention of a baseball game cancellation).\n\nThe verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed. The response uses multiple sources to confirm the outcome, ensuring reliability and reducing the risk of error. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 is directly based on the verified outcome of the event, which is that Stanford won.\n\nThere are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The response strictly adheres to the conditions outlined in the user prompt and does not include any unnecessary or unrelated information.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.
