        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Suns vs. Rockets game on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if the Rockets win, it's p1; Suns win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on the scheduled date. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the game is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place on March 12. For example, source [1] mentions the Rockets defeated the Suns 111-104. Other sources like [2], [3], [6], [11], and [14] all report the same final score with the Rockets winning. \n\nI should verify if there's any mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources discuss the game as having happened, with detailed recaps and stats, so it wasn't postponed or canceled. The altercation between Adams and Plumlee in the second quarter is noted, but the game continued. \n\nSince the Rockets won 111-104, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All the evidence points to a clear Rockets victory without any cancellations or postponements. No conflicting information in the sources, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Houston Rockets defeated the Phoenix Suns 111-104 on March 12, 2025, at the Toyota Center[1][2][3][6][14]. Key factors included Jalen Green's 29-point performance, Houston's 21 fast-break points off Phoenix's 17 turnovers, and a decisive fourth-quarter run to secure the win[1][3][14]. The game featured an altercation leading to ejections of Steven Adams and Mason Plumlee but concluded without postponement or cancellation[2][3][6]. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Rockets win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response demonstrates logical reasoning by checking multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome and ensuring there were no postponements or cancellations. The mention of an altercation during the game and its continuation without disruption further supports the conclusion that the game concluded normally. The response also correctly ignores any irrelevant details that do not affect the resolution, such as individual player performances, focusing solely on the outcome relevant to the market resolution.\n\nThere are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The AI has adhered strictly to the facts and has not included any speculative or unverified information. The response is complete, as it covers all necessary aspects to resolve the query based on the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the thorough verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts, the response is satisfactory.
