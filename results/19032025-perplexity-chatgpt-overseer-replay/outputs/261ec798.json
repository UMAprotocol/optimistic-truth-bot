        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"trans\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions specify that any usage of the term, including pluralization or possessive forms, counts, but other forms don't. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles from the event. Looking at the search results, several sources mention Trump's comments about transgender issues during the press conference. \n\nSearch result [1] from The Pink News quotes Trump saying, \u201cEverything is transgender. Everybody transgender. That is all you hear about and that is why we won the election in record numbers.\u201d The term \"transgender\" is used here. Similarly, search result [9] from The Advocate reports Trump stating, \u201cEverything is transgender. Everybody transgender is all you hear about...\u201d Again, \"transgender\" is used. \n\nIn the YouTube transcripts [5] and [8], Trump is quoted using the word \"transgender\" multiple times. For example, in [5], he says, \u201ceverything's transgender everybody transgender that's all you hear about...\u201d and in [8], \u201ceverything's transgender everybody transgendered...\u201d \n\nThe resolution conditions state that the exact term \"trans\" is needed. However, the ancillary data mentions that pluralization or possessive forms count, but other forms do not. The term in question here is \"transgender,\" which is a different form from \"trans.\" The market specifically looks for the term \"trans,\" not its longer form. \n\nBut wait, the query's description says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if Trump says the listed term, which is \"Trans.\" The ancillary data clarifies that any usage of the term regardless of context counts, including pluralization or possessive, but other forms (like \"transgender\") do not. So, \"transgender\" is a different form and wouldn't count. However, in the transcripts, Trump uses \"transgender,\" not the abbreviated \"trans.\" \n\nBut looking at search result [1], the headline says Trump claimed \"everybody is transgender,\" and the article quotes him using \"transgender\" multiple times. Similarly, in [9], he's quoted using \"transgender.\" The YouTube transcripts also show him saying \"transgender\" or \"transgendered.\" \n\nHowever, in the video transcript from [8], Trump says, \u201ceverything's transgender everybody transgendered that's all you hear about...\u201d Here, \"transgendered\" is a possessive or plural form? Wait, \"transgendered\" is an adjective, not a plural or possessive of \"trans.\" The market's resolution conditions specify that only the exact term \"trans,\" its plural, or possessive counts. Since Trump used \"transgender\" and \"transgendered,\" which are different terms, they wouldn't meet the criteria. \n\nBut wait, the term in the market is \"Trans.\" The resolution conditions state that any usage of the term regardless of context counts, including pluralization/possessive. However, \"transgender\" is a different word. The key is whether \"trans\" is part of \"transgender.\" For example, if he said \"transgender,\" does that include the term \"trans\"? The ancillary data says that compound words count. For instance, if the term was \"joy,\" then \"killjoy\" would count. So, \"transgender\" is a compound of \"trans\" and \"gender.\" According to the rules, compound words count regardless of context. Therefore, \"transgender\" would include the term \"trans\" as part of the compound word, thus qualifying for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nWait, the resolution conditions state: \"Instances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for 'joy,' however 'killjoy' is a compounding of the words 'kill' and 'joy').\" So, \"transgender\" is a compound of \"trans\" and \"gender,\" which would mean that using \"transgender\" counts as using the term \"trans\" in a compound word. Therefore, Trump's use of \"transgender\" would trigger a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nBut the market's listed term is \"Trans.\" The rules say that any usage of the term, including in compound words. So if \"trans\" is part of a compound word like \"transgender,\" that counts. Therefore, Trump's statements using \"transgender\" would count as using the term \"trans\" in a compound word, thus resolving to \"Yes.\"\n\nLooking back at the sources, multiple instances confirm Trump used \"transgender\" during the press conference. For example, in search result [1], he says \"transgender\" multiple times. In the YouTube transcripts [5] and [8], he uses \"transgender\" and \"transgendered.\" Since \"transgender\" is a compound word containing \"trans,\" according to the resolution conditions, this would count. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nDuring the St. Patrick's Day press conference with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025, Donald Trump repeatedly used variations of the term \"transgender\" while discussing his administration\u2019s policies. For example, he stated:  \n\n> \u201cEverything is transgender. Everybody transgender. That is all you hear about and that is why we won the election in record numbers\u201d [1][9].  \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that **compound words containing the term \"trans\" count toward a \"Yes\" resolution**, even if the exact term \"trans\" isn\u2019t used independently. Since \"transgender\" is a compound of \"trans\" and \"gender,\" its usage meets the criteria outlined in the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has several strengths and weaknesses in addressing the user prompt regarding whether Donald Trump said \"Trans\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:**\n   - The response correctly identifies the key issue: whether the term \"Trans\" or its derivatives were used by Donald Trump in the context specified.\n   - The response accurately notes that the term \"transgender\" does not directly match \"Trans\" but explores whether it qualifies under the rules specified for compound words.\n   - The response concludes that \"transgender\" as a compound of \"trans\" and \"gender\" meets the criteria for resolving the market to \"Yes\" (p2). This interpretation aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which states that compound words count.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness:**\n   - The response demonstrates thorough reasoning by examining the implications of the term \"transgender\" being a compound word.\n   - It effectively uses examples and analogies (e.g., \"killjoy\" as a compound of \"kill\" and \"joy\") to justify why \"transgender\" should count as using \"trans.\"\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:**\n   - The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and that Trump used the term \"transgender\" during the press conference.\n   - It aligns the recommendation (p2) with the facts presented and the conditions outlined in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:**\n   - The response does not appear to contain factual errors or biases. It strictly adheres to the information provided in the user prompt and uses it to inform its conclusion.\n   - However, the response could potentially clarify more explicitly that \"transgender\" is universally recognized as a compound word, as some might argue it has become a standalone term.\n\nOverall, the response is logically sound, adheres closely to the instructions, and uses the information provided effectively to arrive at a conclusion. The interpretation of \"transgender\" as a compound word containing \"trans\" is a critical point and is handled well in the response, justifying the resolution to \"Yes\" (p2).\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately interprets the user prompt, logically analyzes the use of the term 'transgender' as a compound of 'trans', and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-reasoned. It might benefit from a more explicit explanation that 'transgender' is recognized as a compound word, but this does not significantly detract from the overall quality and correctness of the response.\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742474946 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-20 12:49:06 UTC",
