The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Air Force vs. UNLV basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if UNLV wins, it's p1; if Air Force wins, p2; if postponed, stays open; if canceled, 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date given is March 19, 2025, which is after March 12, so the event should have already happened. Let me look through the search results to find the game's outcome.\n\nSearch result [7] from ESPN provides a recap of the game on March 12, 2025, where UNLV defeated Air Force 68-59. The box score shows UNLV's score as 68 and Air Force's as 59. Another source, [8] from UNLV's official site, confirms the same score and mentions UNLV advancing to the quarterfinals. Both sources are reliable and directly reference the game's result. \n\nAdditionally, search result [4] mentions the game as part of the Mountain West Championships, and [5] discusses the odds for that specific date. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation in any of the sources. All evidence points to the game being played as scheduled with UNLV winning. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (UNLV).\n</think>\n\nThe Air Force vs. UNLV men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET was played as planned. **UNLV defeated Air Force 68-59** in the Mountain West Conference Tournament first round[7][8]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and the outcome is definitively verified through multiple sources, including official game recaps from both teams and ESPN[7][8].  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- **Final score**: UNLV 68, Air Force 59[7][8].  \n- **Game context**: UNLV, the No. 6 seed, advanced to the quarterfinals, while Air Force (No. 11 seed) ended its season[7][8].  \n- **No postponement/cancellation**: All sources confirm the game occurred on March 12 without disruption[4][7][8].  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions, the market resolves to **UNLV** (p1).  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (Air Force vs. UNLV basketball game) occurred on March 12, 2025, and provides a clear outcome based on reliable sources. The AI checked the current date against the event date and proceeded to verify the outcome since the event date was in the past. This aligns with the instructions to only report on events that have already occurred and can be verified.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically follows the steps outlined in the system prompt. It first confirms the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, then searches for and finds verified sources reporting the outcome. The AI uses multiple sources to confirm the result, which strengthens the reliability of the resolution.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The AI found that UNLV won the game with a score of 68-59 against Air Force. This outcome is supported by multiple sources, including ESPN and UNLV's official site. The response correctly aligns this verified outcome with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a UNLV win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant omissions in the response. The AI focused solely on verified facts and did not speculate or infer beyond the available information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory as it meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation to resolve the market to p1 (UNLV) is well-supported by the evidence provided.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the event using reliable sources and aligns the resolution recommendation correctly with the ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively adheres to the system prompt instructions, providing a clear and well-supported resolution based on verified facts.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
