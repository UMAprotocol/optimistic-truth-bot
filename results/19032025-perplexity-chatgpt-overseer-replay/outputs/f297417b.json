        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the price of a dozen eggs hit $5 or more before April 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for the relevant data points. The ancillary data specifies using the St. Louis Fed's FRED series APU0000708111, which tracks the average price of Grade A large eggs in the U.S. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the egg prices. Result [1] states that in February 2025, the average price was $4.95, up from $2.52 a year earlier. However, result [2] from March 12, 2025, reports the average price at $5.897. Result [5] also mentions February's price at $5.90, and result [6] shows the FRED data with January 2025 at $4.953 and February 2025 at $5.897. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Result [1] says February's price was $4.95, but result [2] and [5] report higher figures in March. Let me cross-reference. Result [6] is the FRED data directly, which lists January 2025 as $4.953 and February 2025 as $5.897. That's a key point. The ancillary data says the market resolves based on any datapoint between January and March. Since February's price is $5.897, which is above $5, the answer should be Yes (p2). \n\nBut wait, result [10] mentions a current price of $5.51 in March 2025, which is still above $5. Also, result [3] notes that wholesale prices dropped to $5 in the latest weekly average but had been as high as $8 in late February. However, the resolution is based on the BLS data via FRED, not wholesale. \n\nThe FRED data in result [6] clearly shows February at $5.897, which is above $5. Therefore, the market should resolve to Yes (p2). Even if March's data isn't out yet, February's data alone meets the condition. The user's query is whether it hit $5 before April, and February's data already does that. So the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe average price for a dozen Grade A large eggs in the U.S. reached $5.897 in February 2025 according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED data (APU0000708111)[2][6]. This exceeded the $5.000 threshold specified in the resolution conditions. While prices fluctuated in March 2025, with some reports showing a slight decline to $5.51[10], the February data point alone satisfies the condition of reaching $5+ \"before April\" as defined in the ancillary data. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response effectively uses the specified URL (St. Louis Fed's FRED series APU0000708111) to gather factual data about the price of eggs, which is crucial for resolving the query based on the conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI correctly identifies the relevant data points from January to March 2025 and uses these to determine whether the price of a dozen eggs reached or exceeded $5.00. The response identifies a discrepancy in reported prices but resolves this by referring directly to the FRED data, which is the primary source specified in the prompt. This approach ensures that the resolution is based on the most reliable and relevant data.\n\nThe recommendation of p2 (Yes) is aligned with the facts presented, as the FRED data clearly shows that the price in February 2025 was $5.897, well above the $5.00 threshold. This satisfies the condition set in the ancillary data for resolving the market to \"Yes\" if the price hits $5.00 or more before April.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI does not speculate or infer beyond the available data, and it maintains a strict adherence to the source specified in the user prompt. The response is complete, as it covers all necessary aspects of the query and provides a clear, evidence-based recommendation.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.

Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742401557 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-19 16:25:57 UTC"
