        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Charlotte vs. Rice college basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Charlotte wins, the resolution is p2; if Rice wins, it's p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's a 50-50 split (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time provided, which is March 19, 2025, 4:22:58 PM UTC. The game was supposed to happen on March 12, so it's already in the past. That means the event has occurred, and I need to verify the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, sources [1], [3], and [8] are directly related to the game. Source [1] from Rice's official site states that Rice lost to Charlotte 64-61 in the first round of the AAC Tournament on March 12. Source [3], the American Athletic Conference's site, confirms the same score, Charlotte winning 64-61. Source [8] from Charlotte's official site also reports their comeback victory with the same score. All three sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity here. \n\nThe other sources ([2], [4], [5], [6], [7]) don't relate to the game's result. For example, [2] is a legal settlement, [4] is about zoning, [5] discusses betting rules, [6] is a prediction before the game, and [7] is unrelated. So the key info comes from the first three sources.\n\nSince the game happened as scheduled and Charlotte won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources confirm the result, so the answer is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Charlotte vs. Rice men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 1:00 PM ET was played as part of the AAC Tournament's first round. **Charlotte defeated Rice 64-61**, overcoming an 11-point halftime deficit with a second-half rally[1][3][8]. Key details:\n\n- **Game Outcome**: Charlotte's Nik Graves and Giancarlo Rosado each scored 18 points, with Graves making critical free throws late. Rice missed a potential go-ahead jumper in the final seconds[1][8].\n- **Postseason Context**: The loss eliminated Rice (13-19) from the tournament, while Charlotte (11-21) advanced to face Florida Atlantic in the second round[3][8].\n\nThe game occurred on its scheduled date without postponement or cancellation. Per the resolution conditions, since Charlotte won, the market resolves to **p2**. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
