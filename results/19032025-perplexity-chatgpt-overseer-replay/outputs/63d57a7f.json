The ancillary data specifies that if USC wins, it's p2; if Rutgers wins, p1; if canceled, p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The current date given is March 19, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results to confirm the outcome. \n\nSearch result [2] from Fox Sports shows the final score as USC 97, Rutgers 89 in double overtime. That's a clear USC win. Another source, [3], mentions USC outlasting Rutgers 97-89 in double OT. Similarly, [5] from SI.com states Rutgers lost in double OT to USC. The official USC athletics site [9] also confirms their victory. Multiple sources like [6], [8], [10], and [11] all report USC winning 97-89 in double overtime. \n\nAll these sources are consistent. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so no need for p3. Since USC won, the resolution should be p2. I need to make sure there's no conflicting info, but all sources agree. No mention of the game being invalidated or any issues. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe USC Trojans defeated the Rutgers Scarlet Knights 97-89 in a double-overtime thriller during the first round of the 2025 Big Ten Tournament on March 12, 2025. The game, held at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, saw USC overcome a late Rutgers comeback attempt and multiple lead changes in overtime periods[2][3][6][9][10]. Key performances included Desmond Claude\u2019s 28 points and 8 assists for USC, while Rutgers\u2019 Dylan Harper led his team with 27 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists[2][8][10]. \n\nThe outcome aligns with the resolution conditions provided:  \n- **USC victory** triggers resolution to \"USC\" (p2).  \n- The game was completed and not postponed or canceled.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response uses multiple reliable sources to verify the outcome, including Fox Sports and the official USC athletics site, which aligns with the requirement to base the resolution on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically processes the information by first confirming the date of the event and then verifying the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly applies the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data (p2 for a USC win).\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event occurred as scheduled and was not postponed or canceled. It aligns the recommendation (p2) with the verified outcome of the event, adhering to the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Any Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The response does not contain any missing information relevant to the resolution of the query.\n\nBased on the analysis, the response is found to be satisfactory.
