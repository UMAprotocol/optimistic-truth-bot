The ancillary data specifies that if the Canucks win, it's p1 (0), Jets win p2 (1), and if canceled, p3 (0.5). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the game was yesterday. Now, looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. For example, source [1] mentions the Canucks won 6-2, and source [2] also states the Canucks handed the Jets a 6-2 loss. Other sources like [3], [4], and [7] all corroborate the Canucks' victory with detailed stats and player quotes. \n\nI should verify the date and time to ensure it's the correct game. The game was scheduled for March 18, 10 PM ET, and the articles are dated March 19, which aligns since the game would end after midnight in some time zones. The results clearly show the Canucks won, so according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (0) for Canucks. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the outcome, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets and Vancouver Canucks played their scheduled NHL game on March 18, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. Multiple verified sources confirm the Vancouver Canucks defeated the Winnipeg Jets 6-2[1][2][3][4][7]. Key details:\n\n- **Final score**: Canucks 6, Jets 2[1][2][7]\n- **Game timeline**: Vancouver scored three first-period goals and maintained control throughout[1][3]\n- **Key performers**: Brock Boeser (2 goals, 1 assist) and Pius Suter (2 goals) led Vancouver[1][2]\n- **Goaltending**: Connor Hellebuyck allowed 5 goals on 21 shots for Winnipeg[1][4]\n\nNo evidence suggests postponement or cancellation. The game concluded as scheduled with a decisive Canucks victory. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Canucks win corresponds to a resolution of p1 (0).\n\nThe response adheres to the system prompt instructions by:\n1. Checking the event date and confirming it is in the past.\n2. Verifying the event outcome through reliable sources.\n3. Ensuring the resolution recommendation (p1) directly corresponds with the definitions provided in the ancillary data.\n4. Not predicting future outcomes but reporting on what has definitively happened.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI does not rely on predictions or assumptions but uses verified facts to resolve the query. The logical reasoning is sound, and the verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts are properly executed.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.
