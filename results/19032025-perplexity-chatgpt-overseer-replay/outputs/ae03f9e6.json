        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Texas vs. Vanderbilt CBB game on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Texas wins, it's p2; Vanderbilt, p1; postponed stays open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, check the date. The current timestamp given is March 19, 2025, so the game on March 12 is in the past. Need to confirm if the game happened as scheduled. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1,2,4,7,9,10,11,12,14) report the game took place on March 12, 2025. For example, source [1] states Texas defeated Vanderbilt 79-72 in the SEC Tournament. The final score from [2] is Texas 79, Vanderbilt 72. \n\nNo sources mention postponement or cancellation. In fact, source [3] talks about a postponed game in January, but that's a different event. The game in question was played as scheduled. \n\nSince the game occurred and Texas won, the resolution should be p2. All relevant sources confirm the outcome, so no ambiguity here. The answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe Texas Longhorns defeated the Vanderbilt Commodores 79-72 in their SEC Tournament first-round game on March 12, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the game occurred as scheduled with no postponement or cancellation[1][2][4][9][11][14]. Texas led by 15 points at halftime (41-26) and maintained control despite Vanderbilt's late rally, closing out the game with clutch free throws[1][4][9]. Key performers included Tramon Mark and Tre Johnson (19 points each for Texas) and Jason Edwards (20 points for Vanderbilt)[1][4][7][9].\n\n**Resolution Analysis**  \n- **Game Outcome**: Texas won 79-72[1][2][4][9][11].  \n- **Postponement/Cancellation**: The game was played as scheduled[1][2][9][14]. A separate January 20 Texas A&M vs. Vanderbilt game was postponed[3], but this is unrelated.  \n\n**Recommendation**: The market resolves to **p2** (Texas).  \n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Texas vs. Vanderbilt game occurred on March 12, 2025, and that Texas won the game with a score of 79-72. This is in line with the user prompt's conditions for resolving the market to \"Texas\" if Texas wins. The response also correctly notes that there were no postponements or cancellations affecting this specific game, which aligns with the resolution conditions provided.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response provides a logical flow from verifying the date of the event, confirming the event took place, and checking for any postponements or cancellations. It then concludes with the correct market resolution based on the outcome of the game. The response also includes details about the game's progress and key performers, which, while not necessary for the resolution, provide additional context and verification that the correct event is being analyzed.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response uses multiple sources to verify the occurrence and outcome of the event, which strengthens the reliability of the resolution. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"p2\" (Texas) is directly aligned with the verified outcome of the game and the conditions specified in the ancillary data.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the outcome of the event as per the user's resolution conditions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's occurrence and outcome, aligns with the resolution conditions, and contains no significant errors or biases.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and well-structured, providing a clear and factual resolution based on the event's verified outcome.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
