        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Oklahoma vs. Georgia CBB game scheduled for March 12 at 9:30 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Oklahoma wins, the market resolves to \"Oklahoma\" (p2), if Georgia wins, it's \"Georgia\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred as scheduled. The current date provided is March 19, 2025, which is after March 12, so the game should have already happened. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place on March 12. For example, source [1] mentions the game on March 12, 2025, and details Oklahoma's 81-75 victory. Other sources like [2], [4], [5], [6], and [7] all corroborate the same result. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome. All the sources state that Oklahoma won 81-75. Jeremiah Fears scored 29 points, leading Oklahoma to the win. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as evidenced by the detailed stats and postgame notes in the search results. \n\nSince the game happened and Oklahoma won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Oklahoma). There's no mention of the game being canceled or postponed, so p3 isn't applicable. All sources agree on the result, so there's no ambiguity. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all sources consistently report Oklahoma's victory. Therefore, the recommendation is clear.\n</think>\n\nThe Oklahoma Sooners defeated the Georgia Bulldogs 81-75 in their SEC Tournament first-round matchup on March 12, 2025. Jeremiah Fears led Oklahoma with 29 points, including four 3-pointers, while Jalon Moore added 14 points and Mohamed Wague contributed 12 points with nine rebounds[1][2][4][5]. The game occurred as scheduled at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any sources[3][6][7].\n\n**Key details confirming resolution:**\n- Final score: Oklahoma 81, Georgia 75[5][6]\n- Game occurred on scheduled date (March 12) and time (9:30 PM ET)[3][6]\n- No reports of cancellation or postponement in any source[1-8]\n\nrecommendation: p2",
