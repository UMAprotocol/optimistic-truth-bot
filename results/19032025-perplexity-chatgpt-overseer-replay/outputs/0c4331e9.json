The ancillary data specifies that if Jacksonville State wins, the market resolves to them (p2), and if Georgia Tech wins, it's p1. If postponed, it stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the game was yesterday. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Sources [1], [2], [3], [5], and [8] all report the final score as Jacksonville State winning 81-64. \n\nSource [1] is a CBS Sports recap stating Jacksonville State's victory. Source [2] from evrimagaci.org also confirms the same score and outcome. The YouTube video in [3] mentions a wire-to-wire win for Jacksonville State. The official Jacksonville State athletics site [5] details their 81-64 win, including coach Harper's 600th career victory. ESPN's game summary [8] lists the final score as 81-64 in favor of Jacksonville State. \n\nSome sources like [4] and [7] had predictions favoring Georgia Tech, but the actual result is clear from the post-game reports. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as all results discuss the game happening on March 18. Therefore, the market should resolve to p2, Jacksonville State. No conflicting information exists about the outcome, so the recommendation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nJacksonville State defeated Georgia Tech 81-64 in the NIT first-round game played on March 18, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][2][5][8]. The Gamecocks led wire-to-wire, with Jaron Pierre Jr. scoring a game-high 30 points[1][5]. This outcome triggers the market resolution condition for a Jacksonville State victory.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:\n   - The response correctly identifies the event (Jacksonville State vs. Georgia Tech game) and its date (March 18, 2025).\n   - It verifies that the event occurred as scheduled by referencing multiple sources that confirm Jacksonville State's victory.\n   - The response adheres to the instruction to resolve based on verified facts and not predictions, as it disregards pre-game predictions and focuses on actual post-game results.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness:\n   - The response logically checks if the game occurred on the scheduled date and then proceeds to verify the outcome using multiple sources.\n   - It provides a clear and direct link between the verified outcome and the resolution condition specified in the ancillary data (p2 for a Jacksonville State win).\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The response uses multiple reliable sources to confirm the outcome of the game, ensuring the verification is robust.\n   - The recommendation to resolve the market to p2 aligns perfectly with the outcome of the game as Jacksonville State won.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:\n   - There is no apparent missing information or bias in the response. The response focuses solely on the event in question and uses verified sources to confirm the outcome.\n   - There are no errors in the processing or interpretation of the event relative to the user prompt and system instructions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the provided instructions.
