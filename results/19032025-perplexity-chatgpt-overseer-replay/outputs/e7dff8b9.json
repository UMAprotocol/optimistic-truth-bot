The ancillary data specifies that if the Canadiens win, it's p1 (0), Senators win p2 (1), postponed remains open, canceled is p3 (0.5). \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to confirm the game's outcome. Looking at the sources provided:\n\n- Source [1] mentions the Canadiens won 6-3 against the Senators on March 18, 2025. It also states they moved into a playoff spot.\n- Source [2] confirms the Canadiens' victory with a 6-3 score, noting Josh Anderson and Christian Dvorak's contributions.\n- Source [3] details the game, including Nick Suzuki's power-play goal leading to a 6-3 win for Montreal.\n- Sources [4], [5], [6], [7], and [8] all consistently report the Canadiens' win, with the final score of 6-3. They also mention the game took place on March 18, 2025, as scheduled.\n\nAll sources agree the game occurred on the scheduled date, wasn't postponed or canceled. The result was a Canadiens victory. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Canadiens). No conflicting information found; all sources corroborate the outcome. The answer is straightforward here.\n</think>\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens defeated the Ottawa Senators 6-3 in their NHL game on March 18, 2025, as scheduled. Multiple sources confirm the Canadiens secured a critical regulation win with five third-period goals, including Nick Suzuki's decisive power-play marker at 15:23 of the final frame[1][3][4][6]. The game was completed without postponement or cancellation[7][8].  \n\n**Key details**:  \n- Final score: Canadiens 6, Senators 3[2][4][6]  \n- Montreal overcame 2-1 and 3-2 deficits in the third period[3][5]  \n- Empty-net goals by Josh Anderson and Brendan Gallagher sealed the victory[4][6]  \n- The game occurred on its originally scheduled date and time[1][3][7]  \n\nThis outcome meets the resolution condition for \"Canadiens win\" as defined in the ancillary data.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",

The response also correctly identifies that the game was not postponed or canceled and occurred on its scheduled date.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it directly correlates the verified outcome of the game with the resolution conditions provided in the user prompt. The response concludes that the market should resolve to p1 (Canadiens win), which aligns perfectly with the ancillary data specified in the prompt.\n\nThe verification of the event is thorough, with multiple sources cited to confirm the game's outcome, ensuring that the information is reliable and not based on a single source. The response also aligns the recommendation with the facts verified from these sources, adhering to the requirement to base the resolution strictly on concrete evidence.\n\nThere are no missing information, bias, or errors detected in the response. The AI has adhered to the instructions by not predicting or assuming outcomes without evidence, and it has focused solely on the event specified in the user prompt.\n\nGiven the accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the outcome of the specified event using multiple reliable sources and aligns the resolution recommendation with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, uses verified sources to confirm the event outcome, and correctly applies the resolution conditions without any detected errors or biases.\"\n}\n```",
