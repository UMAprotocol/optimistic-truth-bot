The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Virginia vs. Georgia Tech basketball game on March 12, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Georgia Tech wins, it's p1; if Virginia wins, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current date given is March 19, 2025, which is after March 12. So the game should have happened. Now, looking at the search results, several sources like [6], [7], [9], [10], [11], [13], and [18] mention the game's result. \n\nFrom source [6], the title says Virginia lost 66-60 to Georgia Tech. The detailed recap in [6] and [7] confirms the final score. Source [9] also states Georgia Tech won 66-60, advancing to the quarterfinals. Other sources like [10] and [11] discuss Virginia's loss and the end of their season. \n\nThe key points are the final score and the outcome. All relevant sources agree Georgia Tech won. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since Georgia Tech won, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. All the post-game reports confirm Georgia Tech's victory. No sources indicate a different result or any issues with the game being completed. Thus, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe ACC Tournament second-round game between No. 9 seed Virginia (15-16) and No. 8 seed Georgia Tech (16-15) occurred on March 12, 2025, at 12:00 PM ET as scheduled. Georgia Tech defeated Virginia 66-60 in a closely contested matchup at Charlotte's Spectrum Center[6][7][9]. The Yellow Jackets overcame a halftime tie (25-25) and built a 13-point second-half lead before surviving Virginia's late rally, which cut the deficit to two points with 25 seconds remaining[6][7]. Key performances included Duncan Powell's 21 points and Baye Ndongo's 16-point/10-rebound double-double for Georgia Tech, while Virginia's Isaac McKneely scored a game-high 27 points with seven three-pointers[6][9].\n\nThis result marked Georgia Tech's first win over Virginia since January 2016, snapping a 13-game losing streak in the series[9][11]. The game was completed without postponement or cancellation, and no evidence suggests unresolved contingencies affecting the outcome. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
