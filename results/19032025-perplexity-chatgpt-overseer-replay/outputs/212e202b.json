        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for a basketball game between MD Eastern Shore and Norfolk State on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for Norfolk State winning, p2 for MD Eastern Shore, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 19, 2025, and the game was on March 12, so it's already happened. That means I don't have to worry about future dates. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome of the game. Looking at the search results, several sources report the game. The first result [1] is from February 15, which is a different game, so I can skip that. Results [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], and [14] all discuss the March 12 game. \n\nFrom [2], the title says \"Hawks come up short, 77-70\" against Norfolk State. The box score in [3] shows Norfolk State won 77-70. ESPN's recap [5] confirms the final score as 77-70 with Norfolk State as the winner. The MEAC article [6] also states Norfolk State advanced with a 77-70 win. The AP article [7] repeats the same score and outcome. The detailed analysis in [14] mentions the game date and again confirms Norfolk State's victory.\n\nAll these sources consistently report that Norfolk State won the game 77-70. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. Since the event occurred and Norfolk State won, the resolution should be p1. \n\nI also need to ensure that the ancillary data matches the outcome. The user specified p1 for Norfolk State, which aligns with the search results. No conflicting information or different events are mentioned, so the resolution is clear. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe March 12, 2025 MEAC Tournament game between Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) and Norfolk State concluded with a **77-70 victory for Norfolk State**, as confirmed by multiple sources[2][3][5][6][7]. The Spartans, the top seed, led throughout the game, overcoming a late push by UMES to secure their place in the semifinals. Key performances included Jalen Myers (22 points) for Norfolk State and Evan Johnson (22 points) for UMES. No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists, and the outcome is definitively verified. \n\nrecommendation: p1",

It correctly identifies the winning team based on multiple reliable sources, which is Norfolk State. The response adheres to the instructions by not predicting future outcomes and focusing solely on verified facts.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the event date, searches for the outcome, and verifies it through multiple sources. It ensures that the event has not been postponed or canceled, which aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions. The reasoning is clear, and the process is well-documented in the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome through several credible sources, ensuring that the information is consistent and reliable. The recommendation to resolve the market as p1 (Norfolk State win) directly aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or significant missing information in the response. The response focuses strictly on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or assumptions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory.
