The ancillary data specifies that if the Hawks win, it's p2 (Hawks), Hornets win p1 (Hornets), postponed remains open, and canceled resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as scheduled. The search results mention the game on March 18, 2025, with the Hawks winning 134-102 [1][2][3][4][6][13]. Multiple sources confirm the score and the date, so the game wasn't postponed or canceled. \n\nNext, verify the teams involved. The Atlanta Hawks and Charlotte Hornets are clearly stated in all relevant search results. The outcome is a decisive win for the Hawks, completing a season sweep [1][3][4]. \n\nCheck for any key players missing or other factors that might affect the result. The Hornets were without LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges [1][3][4][6], but the game proceeded, and the Hawks dominated. No indication of the game being rescheduled or canceled. \n\nSince the game was played and the Hawks won, the resolution should be p2. All conditions are met: the event occurred, the correct teams played, and the Hawks were the victors. No need to consider p1 or p3 here.\n</think>\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks defeated the Charlotte Hornets 134-102 on March 18, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][3][4][6][13]. The game occurred as scheduled with no postponements or cancellations mentioned in the search results. According to the resolution conditions, a Hawks victory corresponds to **p2**.\n\n**Key details:**\n- Final score: Hawks 134, Hornets 102[1][3][6]\n- The game was part of their regular season schedule[6][13]\n- No indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1-13]\n\nrecommendation: p2",
