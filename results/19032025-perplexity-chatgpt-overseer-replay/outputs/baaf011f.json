The resolution conditions state that the market resolves to \"Yes\" if the order is published on the White House's presidential actions page or the press pool by the deadline. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of an executive order on that specific date. Looking through the sources, search result [9] is titled \"Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness\" and is dated March 18, 2025. The content includes the full text of an executive order signed by Trump on that date. The order is about empowering state and local governments in disaster preparedness and resilience. \n\nNext, I need to confirm if this order was published on the White House's presidential actions page. Search result [2] lists presidential actions, and while it doesn't explicitly mention the March 18 order, the most recent entries are from March 15 and 14. However, search result [9] is a direct link to the White House page, indicating that the order was indeed published there. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the order must be published on the White House page. Since [9] provides the full text of the executive order signed on March 18 and is hosted on the White House's site, this meets the criteria. There's no ambiguity here because the order is clearly dated and published on the required platform. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2). No other search results contradict this, and the federal register isn't needed as the primary source confirms the publication.\n</think>\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 18, 2025, titled **\"Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness\"**, which establishes a National Resilience Strategy and shifts disaster response control to state/local governments. The order was published on the White House website under [Presidential Actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) (source [9]), meeting the resolution criteria of requiring publication on the official platform by the deadline. \n\nThe order explicitly states its intent to streamline federal preparedness policies, empower state/local decision-making, and reformulate national continuity capabilities. It includes specific deadlines for policy reviews and revokes or modifies prior executive orders and memoranda, such as Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 and Presidential Policy Directive 8. \n\nSince the order was published on the White House\u2019s designated platform by March 18, 2025, and no ambiguity exists regarding its validity or publication source, the market resolves to **Yes**. \n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742400202 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-19 16:03:22 UTC"
