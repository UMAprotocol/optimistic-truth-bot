The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during his press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether those exact terms were used, considering pluralization or possessive forms but not other variations. The event in question is specifically the press conference, not any preceding meetings. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided to see if any mention Trump using those terms during that event. The search results cover various interactions between Trump and Martin around that time, including discussions about trade, tariffs, and AI policies. \n\nLooking at the sources, several mention Trump's actions related to AI, like revoking Biden's executive order and investing in AI infrastructure. For example, sources [3], [6], [8], [10], [11], [14], and [15] discuss Trump's AI policies and initiatives. However, these are general statements about his administration's actions, not specific to the press conference on March 12. \n\nSources [1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [9], [12], [13], and [16] detail the St. Patrick's Day events and meetings with Martin. These describe Trump's comments on trade, Ireland's economy, and other topics, but none explicitly mention him using \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during the press conference. \n\nThe key here is that the query specifies the press conference on March 12. Even though Trump has made AI-related announcements before and after that date, the search results don't indicate that he discussed AI during that particular event. The press conference focused more on trade relations, tariffs, and the bilateral meeting with Martin. \n\nSince there's no evidence in the provided sources that Trump used the terms during the press conference, the resolution should be \"No\". Additionally, the event occurred on March 12, 2025, which is in the past relative to the current timestamp (March 19, 2025), so there's no future consideration needed. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p1, corresponding to \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to have adhered well to the instructions provided in the system prompt. The response is tasked with determining if Donald Trump mentioned \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during a specific event, a press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. The AI's analysis is based on the search results and sources it reviewed, which did not indicate that Trump used the specified terms during the press conference.\n\nHere are the key points in evaluating the response:\n\n1. Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions:\n   - The response correctly identifies the event in question (the press conference on March 12, 2025) and focuses solely on this event, disregarding any other meetings or discussions that are not relevant to the resolution.\n   - The AI checks for the use of the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" specifically during the press conference, aligning with the user prompt's requirement.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning and Completeness:\n   - The AI provides a logical explanation of its search process and the conclusions drawn from the available sources. It clearly states that while Trump has been involved in AI-related policies, there was no evidence of him using the specified terms during the specific event.\n   - The response is thorough in ensuring that all sources were checked for the specific terms and context required by the user prompt.\n\n3. Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts:\n   - The AI confirms that the event took place in the past relative to the current timestamp and that the resolution does not require consideration of future or hypothetical scenarios.\n   - The recommendation of p1 (\"No\") is aligned with the findings that Trump did not use the terms \"AI\" or \"Artificial Intelligence\" during the press conference.\n\n4. Missing Information, Bias, or Errors:\n   - There is no indication of missing critical information or bias in the response. The AI strictly adheres to the facts and sources available.\n   - The response does not exhibit any errors in processing the user prompt or in the logical deduction of the outcome.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the criteria of accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation of p1 is justified based on the evidence provided and the conditions set forth in the user prompt.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately adheres to the system prompt instructions, provides a logical and complete analysis, and correctly aligns the recommendation with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively analyzed the specific event and terms required, demonstrating thoroughness and accuracy in its conclusion.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742400749 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-19 16:12:29 UTC"
