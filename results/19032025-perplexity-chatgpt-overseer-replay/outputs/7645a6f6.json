        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Heritage\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The resolution conditions are specific: p2 is Yes if he did, p1 is No if he didn't. The updates mention that the event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the word \"Heritage\" during that event. Let's go through the sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them detail Trump's interactions with the Irish PM, the proclamations about Irish-American Heritage Month, and discussions about trade tariffs. The key here is the specific term \"Heritage\" in the context of the press conference or reception.\n\nSearch result [1] mentions Trump declaring March 2025 as Irish-American Heritage Month, but that's a proclamation, not the press conference. [2] and [5] discuss the St. Patrick's Day events, including the reception. In [5], there's a transcript snippet where Trump says, \"I love the Irish\" and talks about Irish contributions, but no mention of \"Heritage.\" \n\nResult [18] is a transcript of the White House St. Patrick's Day Reception. Scrolling through the transcript, Trump mentions \"Irish-American Heritage Month\" multiple times. For example, he says, \"As we celebrate Irish-American Heritage Month...\" However, the term here is part of the official name of the month, which is \"Irish-American Heritage Month.\" The user's query is about the word \"Heritage\" standalone. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that pluralization or possessive forms count, but other forms do not. The term \"Heritage\" in \"Heritage Month\" is part of a proper noun. The question is whether this counts. The user specified that any usage of the term regardless of context counts, including compound words. Since \"Heritage\" is part of \"Heritage Month,\" this would count as an instance of the word \"Heritage\" being used. \n\nLooking further into the transcripts, in [18], Trump says, \"As we celebrate Irish-American Heritage Month...\" Here, \"Heritage\" is part of the official title. According to the rules, even if it's part of a compound term like \"Heritage Month,\" it still counts. Therefore, Trump did use the word \"Heritage\" during the event. \n\nThus, the market should resolve to Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nDonald Trump did use the term \"Heritage\" during the St. Patrick's Day Reception with Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025. In his remarks at the event, Trump explicitly referenced **\"Irish-American Heritage Month\"** multiple times[18], including the statement: *\"As we celebrate Irish-American Heritage Month, we're grateful to be joined by hundreds of these proud patriots right here today\"*[18]. \n\nThe resolution conditions specify that **any usage of the term \"Heritage\"** counts, including pluralization/possessive forms and compound words. While the term appeared as part of the official designation \"Irish-American Heritage Month,\" this still qualifies under the market's rules. No other standalone uses of \"Heritage\" unrelated to the month's title were identified in transcripts of the reception[5][18].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has correctly identified and analyzed the user's query regarding whether Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Heritage\" during his press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025. The response adheres to the system prompt instructions by focusing on the specific event and the exact terms required for resolution. It also correctly identifies that the event has occurred and provides a detailed analysis based on the transcripts available from the event.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound. The AI correctly interprets the user's conditions that any usage of the term \"Heritage,\" including in compound words, counts towards the resolution of the market. It identifies that Trump mentioned \"Irish-American Heritage Month\" during the event, and it correctly concludes that this usage meets the criteria set by the user for the term \"Heritage.\"\n\nThe response is factually accurate in its verification of the event and alignment of the recommendation with the facts. It uses the correct source, the transcript of the event, to verify that Trump did use the term \"Heritage\" as part of \"Irish-American Heritage Month.\" This is in line with the user's stipulation that pluralization, possessive forms, and compound words count towards the resolution.\n\nThere are no significant errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The AI has effectively used the updates provided in the user prompt to refine its analysis and ensure that the resolution is based on the most accurate and relevant information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. It meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately addresses the user's query, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and provides a well-reasoned and factually correct resolution based on the specific event and terms outlined in the user prompt.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses the provided transcripts and adheres to the resolution conditions specified by the user, correctly concluding that the term 'Heritage' was used in a manner that meets the resolution criteria.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742558283 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-21 11:58:03 UTC",
