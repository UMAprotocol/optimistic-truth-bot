The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The user included several sources, including YouTube videos and news articles. The key here is to find any mention of \"Saudi Arabia\" during the specific event mentioned. \n\nLooking at the search results, most of them discuss Trump's interactions with the Irish PM, trade issues, and St. Patrick's Day events. However, there are mentions of Saudi Arabia in other contexts. For example, search result [1] talks about Trump planning a visit to Saudi Arabia for a $1 trillion deal, but that's from March 7, 2025, which is before the press conference. \n\nSearch result [10] mentions a speech Trump gave at a Saudi-backed conference in Miami on February 25, 2025, where he discussed Saudi investments. But this isn't the press conference with the Irish PM. \n\nSearch result [13] includes a transcript where Trump mentions Saudi Arabia in a different context with Netanyahu, not during the Irish PM event. \n\nThe press conference in question is covered in search results [2], [3], [5], [7], [8], [9], [11], [12], [14], [16], and [17]. These sources detail the St. Patrick's Day reception and the discussions around trade and tariffs. None of these transcripts or articles mention Trump saying \"Saudi Arabia\" during that specific event. \n\nThe user's updates mention that the resolution is based on the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET. The videos and articles from that event don't show Trump mentioning Saudi Arabia. Instead, the focus was on US-Ireland relations, trade tensions, and other topics like Gaza. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, there's no evidence that Trump said \"Saudi Arabia\" during the press conference with the Irish PM on March 12. The market should resolve to \"No,\" which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The AI has correctly identified that the event in question is the press conference with the Irish PM on March 12, 2025, and has analyzed multiple sources to determine whether Donald Trump mentioned \"Saudi Arabia\" during this event.\n\nThe response is logically sound and thorough in its approach. It examines various sources, including YouTube videos and news articles, to ensure that the term \"Saudi Arabia\" was not mentioned by Trump during the specific event. The AI also correctly disregards mentions of Saudi Arabia in other contexts or at different times, focusing strictly on the event specified in the user prompt.\n\nThe AI's recommendation of p1 (No) is aligned with the facts presented in the sources it reviewed. There is no evidence from the sources that Trump mentioned \"Saudi Arabia\" during the press conference with the Irish PM. This conclusion is consistent with the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data.\n\nThere are no apparent biases or errors in the response. The AI has adhered to the requirement to base its resolution on concrete evidence from the event itself and has not speculated or inferred beyond the available information.\n\nGiven the detailed verification of the event and the alignment of the recommendation with the facts, the response does not seem to be missing any critical information. The AI has effectively used the updates provided in the user prompt to refine its analysis, ensuring that the resolution is based on the specific event mentioned.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response by Perplexity AI is satisfactory and can be used confidently. There is no need for a rerun as the response meets the criteria for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately analyzes the event in question, adheres to the system prompt instructions, and provides a well-supported recommendation.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and logically sound, with no apparent biases or errors. It effectively uses the provided sources and updates to reach a well-supported conclusion.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742558301 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-21 11:58:21 UTC",
