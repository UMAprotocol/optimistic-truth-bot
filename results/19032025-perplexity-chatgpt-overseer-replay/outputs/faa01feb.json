The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"Letter\" during his press conference with the Irish Prime Minister on March 12, 2025. The resolution depends on whether the term was used, considering pluralization or possessive forms, but not other variations. The event in question is the St. Patrick's Day Reception at 5 PM ET, as per the update.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of Trump using the word \"Letter\" during that specific event. Let's go through the sources provided.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources detail the meeting between Trump and Miche\u00e1l Martin. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles about the press conference. \n\nSource [1] is a YouTube video transcript of the event. Scanning through, Trump discusses trade, tariffs, and Ireland's pharmaceutical industry. There's mention of a letter in source [9], where Trump sent an invitation to Martin, but that's part of the pre-meeting correspondence, not during the press conference. \n\nSource [12] is a transcript of Trump's meeting with Martin. The discussion includes topics like trade, housing, and Ukraine. The word \"Letter\" isn't present here. Similarly, source [17] provides another transcript of their Oval Office meeting. Again, no mention of \"Letter\" in the spoken parts.\n\nOther sources like [3], [6], [8], [10], [16] discuss the content of their discussions but don't reference the term \"Letter\" being used during the press conference. Source [2] talks about letters sent to the Irish government regarding Trump's travel ban, but those are from 2017 and not part of the 2025 event.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that only the press conference counts, not preceding meetings. The update clarifies the event time as 5 PM ET. None of the provided transcripts or summaries from that specific event include Trump saying \"Letter.\" \n\nTherefore, based on the available information, Trump did not use the word \"Letter\" during the press conference. The resolution should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response has been evaluated based on the criteria of factual accuracy, adherence to instructions, logical reasoning, completeness, and alignment of recommendation with facts. Here is the detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies the event in question as the press conference with Miche\u00e1l Martin on March 12, 2025, and adheres to the user prompt by focusing on whether Donald Trump said the word \"Letter\" during this specific event. The response also correctly applies the conditions that pluralization and possessive forms of the word count towards the resolution.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response demonstrates logical reasoning by examining multiple sources, including transcripts and articles, to determine if the word \"Letter\" was mentioned by Trump during the press conference. The AI's decision to check various sources and specifically look for the usage of the word in the context of the press conference aligns well with the requirements of the prompt.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies that the event took place as scheduled and examines the content of the press conference through available transcripts and summaries. The AI concludes that the word \"Letter\" was not mentioned by Trump during the event, leading to a recommendation of p1 (No), which aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, biases, or significant missing information in the response. The AI effectively uses the information available and adheres strictly to the user prompt's conditions.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is found to be satisfactory as it accurately and completely addresses the user prompt, adheres to the instructions, and logically arrives at a recommendation that aligns with the verified facts.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately addresses the user prompt, adheres to the instructions, and logically arrives at a recommendation based on verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to verify the non-usage of the word 'Letter' during the press conference, aligning well with the conditions set in the user prompt.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1742558326 Current Date and Time: 2025-03-21 11:58:46 UTC",
