The game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 11:00 PM ET. The current date is March 19, 2025, so the event has already occurred. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened as planned or if it was postponed or canceled. Looking at the search results, multiple sources confirm the game took place. Source [1] from the Associated Press reports Santa Clara's 101-62 victory over UC Riverside on March 19 (which is the same day as the current timestamp). Source [3] from the Big West Conference also mentions the game's result, and source [6] from Santa Clara's athletics site discusses the game happening. \n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome. All relevant sources [1], [3], and [7] state that Santa Clara won decisively. The final score in [1] is 101-62, and [3] reiterates that UC Riverside fell to Santa Clara with the same score. The historical data in [7] also shows Santa Clara's win. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Santa Clara wins, the market resolves to p1. Since the game occurred and Santa Clara won, there's no need to consider postponement or cancellation. All sources agree on the result, so the resolution is clear. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information, but all sources align. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nSanta Clara defeated UC Riverside 101-62 in their NIT first-round matchup on March 18, 2025, as confirmed by multiple verified sources[1][3][7]. The game occurred as scheduled with no indications of postponement or cancellation. \n\n**Key details:**\n- Santa Clara dominated with 16 made 3-pointers (59% accuracy)[1]\n- The Broncos led 44-33 at halftime and extended their lead with a 15-3 second-half run[1][3]\n- UC Riverside's season ended with a 21-13 record, while Santa Clara advanced to 21-12[3]\n\nThis outcome aligns with the resolution conditions specifying that a Santa Clara win resolves to p1. \n\nrecommendation: p1",
