        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a prediction market for a college basketball game between Northwestern and Minnesota based on specific conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The game was scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 3:30 PM ET. The current date provided is March 19, 2025, which is a week after the game. So the event has already occurred.\n\nNext, I look at the search results to determine the outcome. Search result [1] from SI.com states that Northwestern defeated Minnesota 72-64 in the Big Ten Tournament opener on March 12. Another source, [5] from CBS Sports, confirms the same score and outcome. Both are reputable sports news outlets, so this information is reliable.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if Northwestern wins, the market resolves to p2 (\"Northwestern\"). Since the game happened and Northwestern won, the resolution should be p2. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled in the sources, so the 50-50 scenario doesn't apply here. \n\nI also check if there's any info about the game being suspended or postponed. Search result [4] discusses MLB games and their handling of suspensions, but that's not relevant here. The game in question was completed as per the sources. \n\nTherefore, based on the verified outcome and the resolution conditions provided, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Northwestern Wildcats defeated the Minnesota Golden Gophers 72-64 in their March 12, 2025 Big Ten Tournament game, as confirmed by multiple authoritative sports sources[1][5]. This outcome occurred on the scheduled date with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports.  \n\nUnder the resolution conditions provided:\n- **p2 (Northwestern)** is triggered by their verified victory\n- The game was completed as scheduled (no 50-50 cancellation scenario applies)\n- All sources explicitly confirm the final score and outcome[1][5]\n\nrecommendation: p2",
