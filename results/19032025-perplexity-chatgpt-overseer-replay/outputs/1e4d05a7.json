        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether Donald Trump will invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House by March 31, 2025, based on the ancillary data provided. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if the invitation is extended by that deadline, and \"No\" (p1) otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results to see if there's evidence of an invitation being sent before March 31. Looking at the sources, multiple articles mention that Trump extended an invitation. For example, source [1] from March 10 states that the White House sent the invite and the Eagles accepted. Similarly, source [2] on the same date confirms the invitation was sent. \n\nFurther, source [4] from February 25 quotes Trump saying he would invite them, and source [9] mentions the invitation was accepted with a visit scheduled for April 28. The key here is the date the invitation was sent. The ancillary data's cutoff is March 31, and the invitation was sent by March 10, as per multiple sources. \n\nThere's also a mention in source [10] that the White House press secretary announced the date as April 28, which is after March 31, but the invitation itself was sent before the deadline. The resolution condition is about the invitation being extended by March 31, not the actual visit date. \n\nAll credible reports confirm the invitation was sent in February and March, well before the deadline. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles were invited by President Donald Trump to visit the White House following their Super Bowl LIX victory, with the invitation formally extended by March 10, 2025[1][2][5][9]. Multiple sources confirm the Eagles \"enthusiastically accepted\" the invitation, and logistics for the April 28 visit were finalized by March 11[6][10][12]. This fulfills the ancillary data condition requiring the invitation to occur by March 31, 2025.\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The response adheres to the requirement of verifying factual information about events that have already occurred, as it confirms that Donald Trump did indeed extend an invitation to the Philadelphia Eagles to visit the White House by the specified deadline of March 31, 2025. The response correctly identifies that the invitation was extended by March 10, 2025, which is well within the deadline, and it uses multiple sources to confirm this fact.\n\nThe logical reasoning in the response is sound, as it focuses on the key issue of whether the invitation was extended by the deadline. The response correctly disregards the actual visit date since the resolution condition specified in the user prompt only concerns the invitation date. This shows a good understanding and application of the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt.\n\nThe response also aligns well with the ancillary data provided, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes. The recommendation to resolve the market to \"Yes\" (p2) is directly supported by the verified facts that the invitation was indeed sent before the deadline.\n\nThere are no apparent errors, biases, or missing information in the response. The response uses credible sources to verify the event, and it strictly adheres to the conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently. It meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event of the invitation being extended before the deadline, adheres to the user and system prompt instructions, and logically concludes with a recommendation that aligns with the verified facts.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively uses multiple sources to confirm the event, adheres strictly to the resolution conditions specified, and provides a clear and logical recommendation based on the facts.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
