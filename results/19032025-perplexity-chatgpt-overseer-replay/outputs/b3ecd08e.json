The user wants to know whether Real Madrid or Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid advanced in the UCL Round of 16, based on the provided search results. The ancillary data specifies that p2 (Real Madrid) is the correct resolution if they advance, p1 for Atl\u00e9tico, and p3 if it's a 50-50 due to cancellation or postponement beyond December 31, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The second leg was on March 12, 2025, as per sources [1], [2], [3], and [4]. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the event has already occurred. No issues with postponement here.\n\nNext, looking at the match outcome. Multiple sources report that Real Madrid won the penalty shootout after the aggregate was 2-2. Source [1] mentions Real advanced via penalties, with R\u00fcdiger scoring the decisive penalty. Source [2] confirms the 4-2 shootout win. Source [3] also states Real won 4-2 on penalties. The YouTube highlights in [7] detail the shootout, including the disallowed penalty for Atl\u00e9tico, leading to Real's victory.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that advancement is based on who moves to the next round. All sources agree Real Madrid progressed, so p2 is the correct resolution. There's no mention of cancellation or postponement, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nReal Madrid advanced to the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals by defeating Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 4-2 in a penalty shootout following a 2-2 aggregate draw in their Round of 16 tie[1][2][3]. The second leg on March 12, 2025, saw Atl\u00e9tico win 1-0 in regulation time with Conor Gallagher's record-breaking 27-second goal[1][2], but Real Madrid ultimately prevailed in the shootout after extra time[3][7]. Key moments included Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior's missed penalty in regular time[1][3] and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez's disallowed shootout penalty due to a double touch[3][7]. Antonio R\u00fcdiger converted the decisive spot kick to send Real through[1][3], maintaining their perfect record of eliminating Atl\u00e9tico in Champions League knockout stages[1][3].\n\nrecommendation: p2",

        "response": "The Perplexity AI response appears to be accurate, complete, and adheres well to the system prompt instructions. Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the event (UEFA Champions League Round of 16 match between Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid) has already occurred on March 12, 2025, which is before the current timestamp of March 19, 2025. The response uses multiple sources to verify that Real Madrid won the match via a penalty shootout and thus advanced to the next round. This aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where p2 corresponds to Real Madrid advancing.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks for any postponements or cancellations and confirms there were none, which correctly rules out the p3 (50-50) resolution. It then proceeds to verify the match outcome through multiple sources, ensuring that the recommendation is based on concrete evidence. The detailed recounting of the match events adds to the completeness and reliability of the response.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome using reliable sources, aligning perfectly with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt. The recommendation of p2 (Real Madrid advancing) is directly supported by the facts presented.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent errors, missing information, or bias in the response. The response strictly adheres to the facts and aligns with the user prompt's requirements.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory and meets the high standards required for accuracy and reliability in resolving the query based on the UMA optimistic oracle system's guidelines.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event outcome using multiple sources and aligns perfectly with the ancillary data and system prompt instructions.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is well-structured, factually accurate, and logically sound with a clear alignment to the user prompt's resolution conditions.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
