The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Iowa vs. Ohio State basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 6:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if Iowa wins, the market resolves to \"Iowa\" (p2), if Ohio State wins, it's \"Ohio State\" (p1), and if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date given is March 19, 2025, which is after the game date. So the event is in the past. Now, looking at the search results, several sources (1, 5, 9, 13, 15) report that Iowa defeated Ohio State 77-70 in the Big Ten Tournament opener on March 12. For example, source 1 from Hawkeye Sports clearly states the final score and the outcome. Other sources like CBS Sports and NBC Sports also confirm the result. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. Sources 4 and 8 talk about a postponed game in 2022 and 2024, but those are unrelated to the 2025 game in question. The other sources discuss betting odds and economic impacts, which aren't relevant here. \n\nSince the game was played on the scheduled date and Iowa won, the market should resolve to p2 (\"Iowa\"). All conditions are met, and there's no indication of cancellation or postponement affecting this specific game. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Iowa Hawkeyes defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes 77-70 in the Big Ten Tournament opener on March 12, 2025, as scheduled. The game was played at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, with Iowa securing the victory through key plays in the final minutes, including Brock Harding's decisive 3-pointer[1][5][9][13][15]. \n\n**Key details:**\n- **Final score:** Iowa 77, Ohio State 70  \n- **Game status:** Completed as scheduled (no postponement or cancellation)  \n- **Decisive moment:** Harding's 3-pointer with 16 seconds left extended Iowa's lead to 75-70[1][5]  \n- **Top performers:**  \n  - Payton Sandfort (Iowa): 17 points, 3 rebounds  \n  - Bruce Thornton (Ohio State): 24 points, 9 assists[5][15]  \n\nThe outcome meets the resolution conditions specified - an Iowa victory triggers resolution to \"Iowa\" (p2). There's no evidence of game postponement or cancellation that would alter this resolution.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
