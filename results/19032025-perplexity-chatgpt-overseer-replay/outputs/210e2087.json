        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for a college basketball game between Wyoming and San Jos\u00e9 State on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Wyoming wins, it's p2; if San Jos\u00e9 State wins, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred. The current date given is March 19, 2025, which is after the game date. So the game should have already happened. Let me look through the search results to find the outcome. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game. Result [4] is a box score from Fox Sports dated March 12, 2025, showing San Jos\u00e9 State won 66-61. Similarly, result [9] from CBS Sports and [13] from ESPN both confirm the same score, with San Jos\u00e9 State as the winner. Result [14] from the official Wyoming athletics site also lists the final score as 66-61 in favor of San Jos\u00e9 State. \n\nAll these sources are consistent. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as it was played on the scheduled date. There's no mention of any cancellation or postponement in the search results. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, since San Jos\u00e9 State won, the market should resolve to p1. \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. Other results like [7] and [8] discuss betting odds and line movements but don't contradict the outcome. The rest of the search results are about other games or unrelated regulations. \n\nNo sources indicate the game was canceled or didn't happen. All evidence points to San Jos\u00e9 State winning. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe Wyoming vs. San Jos\u00e9 State men's basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 2:00 PM ET was played as planned. Multiple verified sources confirm San Jos\u00e9 State defeated Wyoming 66-61 in the Mountain West Conference Tournament First Round[4][9][13][14]. The game concluded without postponement or cancellation, with San Jos\u00e9 State leading wire-to-wire and maintaining control despite Wyoming's second-half efforts[13]. \n\nGiven the resolution conditions:\n- **p1** (San Jos\u00e9 State victory) applies as the definitive outcome  \n- No evidence of postponement or cancellation exists in the search results  \n- The final score aligns with all primary sources including official box scores and sports networks  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
