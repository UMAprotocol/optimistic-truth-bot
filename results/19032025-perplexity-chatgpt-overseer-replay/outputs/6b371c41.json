The ancillary data specifies that if the 76ers win, it's p2; Raptors win, p1; postponed remains open, and canceled is p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check the actual result of the game. Looking at the search results, the game was played on March 12, 2025. The recap from ESPN [1] states the Raptors won 118-105. Another source [5] confirms the final score as Raptors 118, 76ers 105. The box score from Fox Sports [5] also lists the Raptors as the winners with Jared Rhoden and Orlando Robinson leading their team. \n\nThere's a mention in search result [12] that the Raptors won 118-105, emphasizing their victory despite both teams having many players out. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, as multiple sources report the game occurred on the scheduled date. \n\nSome sources like [3] and [11] are predictions from February 2025, but the actual game happened in March. Those predictions favored the 76ers, but the real outcome was a Raptors win. No sources indicate the game was postponed or canceled. \n\nTherefore, the Raptors won, so the resolution should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA game between the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors on March 12, 2025, resulted in a **Toronto Raptors victory** with a final score of **118-105**[1][5][12]. Key contributors included AJ Lawson (28 points), Jared Rhoden (25 points, 12 rebounds), and Orlando Robinson (25 points, 12 rebounds)[1][5].

The AI correctly identified that the game occurred on March 12, 2025, and was not postponed or canceled. It provided evidence from multiple sources confirming the Toronto Raptors' victory with a score of 118-105. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, where a Raptors win corresponds to a resolution of p1.\n\nThe response is logically sound and complete, as it checks for the actual result of the game, confirms the outcome with multiple sources, and ensures there was no postponement or cancellation that would affect the resolution. The AI's recommendation of p1 is based on verified facts that the Raptors won the game, which is directly in line with the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\nThere are no apparent biases, errors, or missing information in the response. The AI did not rely on predictions or speculative sources but instead used confirmed reports of the game's outcome. The response also correctly ignored irrelevant predictions from before the game, focusing solely on the actual results.\n\nOverall, the response meets the requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation aligns perfectly with the ancillary data and the factual outcome of the event.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately resolved the market based on the factual outcome of the NBA game, adhering to the system prompt instructions and ancillary data.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response effectively used multiple sources to confirm the game's outcome and correctly aligned the resolution recommendation with the conditions provided.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
