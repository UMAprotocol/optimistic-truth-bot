        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Anaheim Ducks vs. Utah Hockey Club game on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Utah wins, it's p1; if the Ducks win, p2; postponed remains open; canceled is p3. \n\nFirst, I need to check the event date. The current timestamp is March 19, 2025, so the game on March 12 is in the past. That means the event has already occurred. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (1 through 14) report the game. Let's check the dates. Most sources are from March 12 or 13, 2025, which aligns with the game date. \n\nSources [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [14] all state that Utah won 3-2. For example, source [2] says \"Utah Hockey Club beat the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 on Wednesday night.\" Wednesday, March 12 matches the game date. Similarly, source [5] mentions \"Utah Hockey Club defeated the Anaheim Ducks 3-2.\" \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources confirm the game was played as scheduled. The final score is consistently reported as Utah 3, Ducks 2. \n\nSince Utah won, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1. All the sources corroborate this outcome without any discrepancies. No sources suggest a different result or issues with the game's completion. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Anaheim Ducks and Utah Hockey Club on March 12, 2025, concluded with a **3-2 victory for Utah** at Delta Center in Salt Lake City. Multiple sources confirm Utah's Dylan Guenther scored the game-winning power-play goal at 7:03 of the third period, assisted by defenseman Mikhail Sergachev[2][3][5][8][9]. Utah outshot Anaheim 39-21[3][9][14], and goaltender Karel Vejmelka made 19 saves to secure the win[5][7][10].\n\n**Key details supporting Utah's victory:**\n- Utah's Jack McBain opened scoring at 11:03 of the first period[5][7][10], followed by Alexander Kerfoot's second-period goal[2][3][9].\n- Anaheim tied the game 2-2 early in the third period with Mason McTavish's power-play goal[2][5][8], but Guenther's decisive goal came less than four minutes later during a Utah power play[3][9][14].\n- The game was played to completion with no indications of postponement or cancellation in any reports[1-14].\n\nGiven the verified outcome and resolution conditions defined in the ancillary data, the market resolves to **Utah (p1)**.  \nrecommendation: p1",

The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome of the event using multiple sources, which all corroborate that Utah won the game 3-2. This outcome aligns with the user prompt's resolution conditions where a Utah win corresponds to p1.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response is logically structured, starting with verifying the date of the event, followed by confirming the event's occurrence and outcome through multiple sources. It then matches the verified outcome with the resolution conditions provided in the ancillary data. The response also includes specific details from the game, such as scores by period and key players, which supports the credibility of the sources and the final outcome.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and its outcome accurately based on the provided date and details. It aligns the recommendation (p1) with the verified facts and the resolution conditions specified in the user prompt.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent missing information, bias, or errors in the response. The AI has strictly adhered to the facts and has not included any unnecessary or irrelevant information.\n\nGiven the detailed and accurate verification of the event and its outcome, and the correct application of the resolution conditions, the response is satisfactory and can be used confidently.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the event's outcome and aligns with the resolution conditions.
