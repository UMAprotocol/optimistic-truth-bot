The ancillary data specifies that if Cal Poly wins, the market resolves to \"Cal Poly\" (p2), and if UC Davis wins, it resolves to \"UC Davis\" (p1). If the game is canceled, it's 50-50 (p3). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event occurred on or before the current date, which is March 19, 2025. The game was scheduled for March 12, so it's in the past. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources [1][2][4][7][9][10][11] confirm that Cal Poly won the game 86-76. For example, source [1] states, \"Owen Koonce scored 18 points and No. 7 seed Cal Poly beat sixth-seeded UC Davis 86-76 on Wednesday night in the first round of the Big West Conference Tournament.\" Similarly, source [7] from UC Davis's own website mentions the final score and that their season ended with this loss. \n\nThere's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled. All sources agree the game took place as scheduled, and Cal Poly was the victor. Therefore, according to the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p2 (Cal Poly). \n\nI need to ensure there's no conflicting information. The prediction sources [3][6] had Cal Poly as favorites, but the actual result is confirmed by multiple credible sources, including official team pages and sports news outlets. No sources indicate a different outcome or cancellation. \n\nThus, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Cal Poly vs. UC Davis men's basketball game occurred as scheduled on March 12, 2025, with Cal Poly defeating UC Davis 86-76[1][2][4][7][9][10]. Multiple sources confirm the final score and outcome, including official game recaps from both universities[7][10] and sports media outlets[1][9]. The game was not postponed or canceled, and no make-up game was required.  \n\nBased on the resolution conditions provided, the market should resolve to **Cal Poly** (p2) as the decisive winner.  \n\nrecommendation: p2",
