        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Butler vs. Providence game on March 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if Butler wins, it's p2; Providence, p1; postponed remains open; canceled is 50-50. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event date is in the past. The current date given is March 19, 2025, so the game on March 12 is definitely in the past. Next, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results. \n\nLooking at the sources, several articles like [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10] report that Butler won the game 75-69. For example, source [4] is from Butler's official sports site, which is a reliable primary source. It states, \"Twenty-five points from Pierre Brooks II led the Bulldogs to a 75-69 win over Providence.\" Similarly, CBS Sports [8] and Fox Sports [7] confirm the final score with Butler as the winner. \n\nThe resolution conditions say a Butler win corresponds to p2. All the credible sources agree on the outcome, so there's no ambiguity. There's no mention of the game being postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. Therefore, the correct resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe Butler vs. Providence men's college basketball game scheduled for March 12, 2025, at 4:00 PM ET at Madison Square Garden concluded with **Butler defeating Providence 75-69** in the first round of the BIG EAST Tournament. Multiple verified sources, including official team reports and sports media outlets, confirm this outcome[4][6][7][8][9]. \n\n**Key details of the game:**\n- Butler led wire-to-wire, never trailing in the contest[6][9].\n- Senior forward Pierre Brooks II scored a game-high 25 points for Butler[4][7][8].\n- Providence\u2019s Bensley Joseph led the Friars with 20 points but struggled from three-point range (8/35 as a team)[6][8].\n\nThe game was completed as scheduled, and no postponement or cancellation occurred. Based on the resolution conditions provided, the market resolves to **\"Butler\"** (p2). \n\nrecommendation: p2",

Here is a detailed evaluation:\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy and Adherence to Instructions**: The response correctly identifies that the Butler vs. Providence game occurred on March 12, 2025, and that the current date is March 19, 2025, making the event a past one. The AI then proceeds to verify the outcome of the game using reliable sources, which is in line with the instructions to use verified facts. The sources mentioned (Butler's official sports site, CBS Sports, Fox Sports) are appropriate and credible for confirming the game's outcome.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Completeness**: The response logically checks the event date, confirms it is in the past, and then verifies the outcome through multiple sources. It correctly matches the outcome (Butler win) with the resolution condition (p2) provided in the ancillary data. The response also confirms that the game was neither postponed nor canceled, which aligns with the user prompt conditions.\n\n3. **Verification of Event and Alignment of Recommendation with Facts**: The response verifies the event's occurrence and outcome accurately and aligns the recommendation (p2) with the verified facts. The details provided about the game (scores, key players' performances) further support the outcome's credibility.\n\n4. **Missing Information, Bias, or Errors**: There are no apparent biases, errors, or significant missing information in the response. The AI has focused strictly on the event in question without deviating into unrelated details or speculative content.\n\nGiven the above points, the response from Perplexity AI is satisfactory as it meets the requirements of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the system prompt instructions. The recommendation of p2 is well-supported by verified information, and there is no need for a rerun or default to p4.\n\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED\",\n  \"require_rerun\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The response accurately verifies the past event's outcome using credible sources and aligns the recommendation with the ancillary data provided.\",\n  \"critique\": \"The response is thorough and adheres closely to the instructions, providing a well-supported resolution based on verified facts.\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"\"\n}\n```",
