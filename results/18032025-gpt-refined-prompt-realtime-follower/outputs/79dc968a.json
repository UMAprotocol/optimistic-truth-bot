  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for a college basketball game between UC Riverside and Santa Clara. The event in question is scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 11:00 PM ET. The current timestamp provided is March 19, 2025, 04:46:18 UTC, which is the next day. So first, I need to check if the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, there's a mix of predictions and some live score data. The key here is to determine if the game has taken place. The current date is March 19, 2025, and the game was scheduled for March 18 at 11 PM ET. Since 11 PM ET on March 18 would be 04:00 UTC on March 19, the current time is 04:46 UTC, which is after the scheduled start time. However, the game might still be ongoing or just concluded.\n\nSearch result [9] from AiScore shows a live score with Santa Clara leading 37-26 in the first quarter. Wait, basketball games don't have quarters; they have halves. That might be a typo or incorrect data. Also, the time mentioned is Q1 04:19, which suggests the game is in progress. However, the date on the AiScore page is listed as 2025/03/19, which matches the current date. This indicates the game is happening now or just finished.\n\nOther sources like [14] mention the game is set for March 18 at 8 PM PT, which is 11 PM ET, aligning with the user's query. The live score in [9] suggests the game is ongoing. Since the current time is 04:46 UTC on March 19, which is 04:46 AM, the game would have started at 04:00 UTC (11 PM ET on March 18) and might still be in progress or recently concluded.\n\nHowever, the resolution conditions state that if the event is in the past and no verifiable outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome. The predictions overwhelmingly favor Santa Clara, with probabilities around 85% [1][2][4][10]. But if the game is still ongoing or just finished, there might not be verified results yet.\n\nBut wait, the AiScore live score [9] shows Santa Clara leading 37-26 in the first quarter. If the game is ongoing, it's a future event relative to the current timestamp? Wait, the current time is 04:46 UTC, and the game started at 04:00 UTC. So it's been 46 minutes since the start. A college basketball game typically lasts about 2 hours, so the game would have ended around 06:00 UTC. The current time is 04:46 UTC, so the game is still ongoing. Therefore, the event hasn't concluded yet, making it a future event relative to the current timestamp. Thus, according to the rules, we should return p4.\n\nBut wait, the user's current timestamp is 2025-03-19 04:46:18 UTC. The game started at 11 PM ET on March 18, which is 04:00 UTC on March 19. The game is scheduled for 11 PM ET on March 18, which is 04:00 UTC on March 19. The current time is 04:46 UTC, so the game started 46 minutes ago. College games last about 2 hours, so it's still in progress. Therefore, the event is ongoing but not yet concluded. Since the outcome isn't verified yet, the resolution should be p4.\n\nHowever, some sources like [9] show a live score, but it's unclear if that's real-time or a placeholder. The other sources are all predictions, not actual results. Since the game is scheduled for a time that has already passed but is still within the expected duration, and there's no verified outcome reported yet, the correct resolution is p4 because the event hasn't concluded, and the outcome isn't confirmed.\n</think>\n\nThe UC Riverside vs. Santa Clara NIT game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 11:00 PM ET (04:00 UTC on March 19). The current timestamp is **2025-03-19 04:46:18 UTC**, placing it **46 minutes after the game's scheduled start time**. College basketball games typically last ~2 hours, meaning the event was ongoing at the time of resolution and had not concluded.  \n\nNo verified final score or outcome is available in the provided sources. While predictions heavily favored Santa Clara (85%-86% win probability[1][4][10]), these represent pre-game analyses, not post-event verification. The live score from AiScore[9] shows an in-progress game with Santa Clara leading 37-26 in the first quarter, but this data is inconsistent with standard basketball timing (games use halves, not quarters) and lacks corroboration from other sources.  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, since the event was scheduled for a future time relative to the current timestamp and no conclusive outcome is verifiable, the recommendation is:  \n\n**recommendation: p4**",
