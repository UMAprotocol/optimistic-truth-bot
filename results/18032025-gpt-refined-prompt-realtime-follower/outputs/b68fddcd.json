  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for an NHL game between the New York Islanders and Pittsburgh Penguins scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if the Islanders win, it resolves to p2; if the Penguins win, p1; postponed keeps it open, and canceled resolves to p3. The current timestamp is March 19, 2025, 01:38:22 UTC, which is the next day after the game. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, and the current time is past that date. So, the event should have already taken place. Now, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [1] is a box score from Fox Sports dated March 18, 2025, which mentions the Penguins won by 4 goals in the last game. However, the detailed stats here might be from a previous season or a different game since the date is listed as 2024-03-18 but the game is in 2025. There's a possible inconsistency here. \n\nSource [3] from CBS Sports provides a live update for the March 18, 2025 game. It mentions that the Islanders edged the Penguins 4-3 in a shootout on Nov. 5, but the main article talks about the game on March 18, 2025. The article states that the Penguins had a four-game winning streak and the Islanders snapped a three-game losing streak. However, the live score table in [3] shows the game as \"New YorkNYI30-28-8\" vs \"PittsburghPIT28-31-10\" with all periods marked as \"-\", which might indicate the game was not yet played or the data is incomplete. \n\nSource [6] from The Score lists the game on March 18, 2025, with the Islanders at 30-28-8 and Penguins at 28-31-10, but the offensive and defensive stats are provided without a final score. The team comparison shows the Penguins on a 4-game winning streak, while the Islanders have a 1-game streak. \n\nSource [4] from Fox Sports Pittsburgh previews Rickard Rakell's performance heading into the March 18 game but doesn't provide the result. \n\nSource [2] and [7] provide historical head-to-head stats but don't mention the specific March 18, 2025 game's outcome. \n\nGiven the current timestamp is March 19, 2025, the game should have results. However, none of the sources explicitly state the final score or outcome of the March 18, 2025 game. The CBS Sports article [3] discusses the game's context but doesn't conclude the result. The Fox Sports box score [1] might be a placeholder or incorrect date entry. \n\nSince there's no verifiable information on the game's outcome from reliable sources provided, and the event date is in the past, according to the instructions, if no outcome is available, we should assume the most probable outcome based on ancillary data. The Penguins were on a 4-game winning streak, and the Islanders had a weaker record. However, without explicit confirmation, the safe resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved). But wait, the instructions say if the event date is past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data's resolution conditions don't include p4; p3 is for canceled games. The user prompt's ancillary data says p1: Penguins, p2: Islanders, p3: 50-50 if canceled. Since the game wasn't canceled, and if no info is found, perhaps p3 isn't applicable. But the instructions state if no verifiable info, default to p4. However, the system prompt says to end with p1-p4. Wait, the user's ancillary data defines p1, p2, p3, but the system's personalization says to return p4 if unresolved. \n\nWait, the user's query includes ancillary data with p1, p2, p3, but the system's personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future or unresolved. However, the event is in the past. Since no sources confirm the outcome, and we can't verify, the correct recommendation is p4. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the Penguins were on a streak, but without explicit confirmation, it's risky. The correct approach here is to return p4 because there's no verified outcome in the sources provided. The sources mention the game but don't report the result, so it's unresolved.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the New York Islanders and Pittsburgh Penguins scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET has passed based on the current timestamp of March 19, 2025, 01:38:22 UTC. However, **no verifiable outcome** for this specific game is provided in the search results. While sources [1][3][6] reference the matchup, they either lack a final score, display incomplete data (e.g., placeholder \"-\" in period scores[3]), or focus on historical head-to-head statistics[2][7] rather than the March 18, 2025, result.  \n\nThe ancillary data specifies resolving to p1 (Penguins win), p2 (Islanders win), or p3 (canceled). Since the game was not reported as postponed or canceled, p3 does not apply. Without explicit confirmation of the outcome from reliable sources, the resolution cannot be determined definitively.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",
