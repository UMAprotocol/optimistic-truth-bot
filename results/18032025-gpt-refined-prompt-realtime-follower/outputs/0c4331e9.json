  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the Jacksonville State vs. Georgia Tech basketball game. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Georgia Tech\" (p1) if they win, \"Jacksonville State\" (p2) if they win, and p3 or p4 under other conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp is March 19, 2025, at 00:55:50 UTC. The game was scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. Since ET is UTC-4, 7:00 PM ET on March 18 would be 23:00 UTC on the same day. The current time is just past midnight UTC on March 19, so the game should have already taken place.\n\nNext, I need to verify the outcome using the provided search results. Looking through the sources:\n\n- Source [1] from Dimers.com gives a prediction of Georgia Tech winning 71-66, but it's a prediction, not a confirmed result.\n- Sources [2], [3], and [6] discuss the upcoming game, all dated March 18, but don't report the result. They mention the game is scheduled for 7 PM ET on March 18.\n- Source [5] from SI.com also provides a prediction (Georgia Tech 76-70) but is dated March 18, before the game.\n- Source [8] from Fox Sports has a box score page dated March 17, but the content doesn't show the actual result, just stats and player info.\n\nNone of the search results provide a confirmed outcome of the game. Since the event date is in the past but there's no verifiable information on the outcome, I need to follow the ancillary data's instruction: if no info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The predictions heavily favor Georgia Tech (72% win probability in [1]), so the probable outcome is Georgia Tech winning. However, UMA's oracle requires verified facts, not predictions. Without confirmed results, the safe resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved now). Wait, but the current time is after the game's scheduled time. Maybe the results aren't updated yet. Since the sources don't confirm the result, even though the game has passed, I can't verify the outcome. Therefore, according to the rules, if the event is in the past but no verifiable info exists, and the user didn't specify postponement/cancellation, assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions say to use verified facts. Since there's no confirmation, maybe p4 is correct. Wait, the ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. But the UMA protocol requires verified data. The user's prompt says if no verifiable info, and event date is past, assume probable outcome. So in this case, since the game was scheduled for March 18, which is in the past, and no sources confirm the result, but predictions suggest Georgia Tech, the resolution would be p1. However, the strict rule is to only use verified facts. Since none of the sources report the actual result, even though the game has occurred, the correct recommendation is p4 because the outcome isn't verified. Wait, the current time is March 19, 00:55 UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time (March 18, 23:00 UTC). The game should have ended, but the provided sources don't include post-game reports. Therefore, without verified results, despite the probable outcome, the resolution should be p4. But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. So maybe p1. But the key is that the oracle requires verified facts. Since there's no confirmation, even if the game happened, the answer should be p4. But the user's ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable. So in this case, the resolution would be p1. However, I need to check the exact instructions again. The user's prompt says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So since the event date is in the past and no sources contradict, assume Georgia Tech win (p1). But wait, the sources are all from before the game. The latest source is March 18, but the game was at 7 PM ET, which is late in the day. The sources might not have been updated post-game. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4 because the outcome isn't verified yet. But according to the user's instructions, if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable. So p1. Hmm, conflicting. The key is whether the event has occurred. The game was scheduled for March 18, 7 PM ET, which is March 18, 23:00 UTC. The current time is March 19, 00:55 UTC, so the game should have concluded. However, the provided search results do not include any post-game reports. All sources are from before the game. Therefore, there's no verified outcome available in the provided sources. According to UMA's oracle rules, without verified facts, even if the event date has passed, if there's no confirmation, it can't be resolved. But the user's ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable. So the resolution would be p1. However, the UMA protocol requires disputes to be based on verified data. Since the sources don't confirm the result, the correct answer is p4. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" Therefore, since the event date is in the past and no info, assume Georgia Tech win (p1). But the sources are all predictions. The actual result isn't reported. So according to the user's rules, even if it's a prediction, if the event is past and no info, use the probable outcome. Therefore, recommendation: p1.\n</think>\n\nThe event in question is the college basketball game between Jacksonville State and Georgia Tech scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 7:00 PM ET. According to the current timestamp (March 19, 2025, 00:55:50 UTC), the game has already occurred. However, none of the provided search results contain verified information about the game's outcome. All sources either discuss pre-game predictions[1][5] or provide team/contextual details without reporting final results[2][3][6][8].  \n\nPer the resolution conditions, when an event date is in the past but no verifiable outcome exists, the resolution defaults to the most probable outcome based on ancillary data. Pre-game projections heavily favored Georgia Tech, with a 72% win probability[1] and predicted scores of 71-66[1] and 76-70[5]. No sources contradict this likelihood.  \n\nrecommendation: p1",
