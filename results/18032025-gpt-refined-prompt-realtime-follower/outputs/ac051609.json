  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to act as an UMA optimistic oracle to resolve a market based on the outcome of a specific NHL game between the Winnipeg Jets and Vancouver Canucks scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET. The ancillary data defines the resolution conditions: p1 for Canucks win, p2 for Jets win, p3 if canceled, and p4 if the event hasn't occurred yet. The current timestamp is March 19, 2025, 04:27:03 UTC.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already happened. The game was scheduled for March 18 at 10:00 PM ET, which is March 19 in UTC time. Since the current time is 04:27 UTC on March 19, the game would have occurred a few hours prior. However, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking through the search results, there are conflicting reports. Some sources like [2], [3], and [6] list the game as scheduled for March 18 or 19, 2025, with some even providing betting odds and predictions. However, other sources like [10], [13], [14], and [15] provide detailed box scores and video highlights indicating that the game took place, with the Vancouver Canucks winning 5-2. Specifically, [10] and [14] show the final score as Canucks 5, Jets 2, with Brock Boeser and others scoring for Vancouver.\n\nThe key here is to ensure that the event in question is the exact one mentioned. The ancillary data refers to the game on March 18 at 10:00 PM ET. The search results confirm that this game occurred, and the Canucks won. Therefore, based on the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p1 (Canucks win). However, I must cross-verify all sources to ensure accuracy and that there's no conflicting information.\n\nSome sources like [1] and [4] refer to a previous game in January 2025 where the Jets won 6-1, but that's a different event. The March 18 game is clearly documented in the later sources with the Canucks' victory. There's no mention of postponement or cancellation, so p3 isn't applicable. Since the event has occurred and the outcome is verified, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Winnipeg Jets and Vancouver Canucks scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 10:00 PM ET has concluded. Verified sources confirm the **Vancouver Canucks defeated the Winnipeg Jets 5-2** [10][13][14]. The game's outcome is documented with detailed scoring summaries, including goals by Brock Boeser, Nils Hoglander, and others for the Canucks, and Nikolaj Ehlers and Pius Suter for the Jets[10][14]. \n\nSince the event occurred as scheduled and the Canucks secured a victory, the resolution aligns with the ancillary data's defined conditions: **p1 corresponds to a Canucks win**. There is no indication of postponement or cancellation in the verified sources.\n\nrecommendation: p1",
