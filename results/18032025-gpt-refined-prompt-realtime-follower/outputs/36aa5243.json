  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the outcome of the CSU Northridge vs. Stanford basketball game scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 11:00 PM ET. The current timestamp is March 19, 2025, 5:15:10 UTC, which is the next day. So first, I need to check if the event has already occurred.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game was scheduled for March 18 at 11:00 PM ET. Since the current time is past that, the event should have already happened. Now, I need to verify the outcome from the provided sources.\n\nSearch result [9] from CBS Sports states that the game was part of the NIT and mentions Stanford's historical performance against CSU Northridge, but doesn't give the result. However, result [10] from ESPN's preview also doesn't list the outcome. Result [11] from evrimagaci.org discusses the upcoming game but doesn't provide the result. \n\nWait, result [8] is a box score from a different game (San Diego St. vs. North Carolina), so that's irrelevant. Results [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [9], [10], [11] all discuss the game as upcoming or provide predictions, but none confirm the actual result. The latest info in the search results is from March 18, 2025, which is the day of the game, but the actual outcome isn't reported in any of the provided sources. \n\nSince the event date is in the past but there's no verifiable information on the outcome in the sources, I need to follow the ancillary data. The resolution conditions state that if the game is canceled, it resolves to 50-50 (p3), but if it's postponed, the market remains open. However, there's no mention of postponement or cancellation in the sources. \n\nGiven the lack of outcome data, I should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The predictions in the sources heavily favor Stanford, with multiple sources predicting a Stanford win. However, without concrete evidence, the UMA protocol requires verified facts. Since none of the sources confirm the actual result, even though predictions lean towards Stanford, the correct resolution under UMA's guidelines would be p4 (cannot be resolved at this time) due to insufficient verified information. But wait, the ancillary data says if the event date is past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if no verifiable info exists, default to p4. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" So even if the sources don't report the outcome, I should infer based on the most probable outcome. The predictions all suggest Stanford was favored, but the actual result isn't confirmed. However, the ancillary data defines p1 as Stanford win. Since the event date is past and there's no outcome info, but the sources don't contradict, I should resolve to p1. But wait, the instructions also say if no verifiable info, default to p4. Wait, conflicting instructions here. Let me recheck.\n\nThe user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the sources don't provide the actual result, but the predictions all indicate Stanford was expected to win. However, predictions are not verified outcomes. Since there's no actual result reported, even though predictions favor Stanford, the correct resolution would be p4 because there's no verified outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe event in question is the CSU Northridge vs. Stanford college basketball game scheduled for **March 18, 2025, at 11:00 PM ET**. The current timestamp is **March 19, 2025, 5:15:10 UTC**, which is after the scheduled game time. However, none of the provided search results explicitly confirm the outcome of the game. All sources either preview the matchup, provide predictions, or discuss historical context without reporting a final score or result. For example:  \n- Search result [9] states the game was part of the NIT but does not list the outcome.  \n- Predictions from sources like [1], [4], and [6] favor Stanford but are not verified results.  \n\nUnder UMA\u2019s resolution guidelines, **verified facts** are required to resolve the request. Since no reliable sources confirm the game\u2019s outcome, postponement, or cancellation, the resolution defaults to **p4** (insufficient data).  \n\nrecommendation: p4",
