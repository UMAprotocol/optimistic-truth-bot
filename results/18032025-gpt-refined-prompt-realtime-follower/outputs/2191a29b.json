  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking me to act as an UMA optimistic oracle to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Anaheim Ducks vs. Dallas Stars NHL game scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET. The current timestamp provided is March 19, 2025, 02:44:45 UTC, which is the next day after the game was supposed to take place. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The game was scheduled for March 18 at 8:00 PM ET. Since the current time is March 19 at 2:44 AM UTC, which is 8:44 PM ET on March 18, the game should have already taken place. However, I need to verify the actual outcome using the provided search results.\n\nLooking through the search results, several sources mention the game. For example, result [1] is a prediction article from March 18, 2025, discussing the upcoming game. Results [3], [5], [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], and [14] also discuss the game as a future event, providing predictions and odds. However, none of these sources provide the actual result of the game since they were published before or around the game time.\n\nResult [9] from Fox Sports mentions a game on March 18, 2025, between the Ducks and Stars, but the detailed stats and scores are not present. The page lists leading scorers and team stats but doesn't show the final score. Similarly, result [12] from The Score provides a matchup page with team stats but no final score. \n\nResult [7] from ESPN's pregame analysis also doesn't include the result, as it's a preview. Other results like [2] and [6] refer to a previous game between the teams on February 4, 2025, where the Ducks won 2-1. However, that's a different game and not the one in question here.\n\nSince all the provided search results either predict the outcome or discuss past games, there's no verifiable information confirming the result of the March 18, 2025 game. The UMA oracle requires concrete evidence from reliable sources to resolve the market. Without any post-game reports or confirmed scores, I can't definitively determine the outcome. \n\nAccording to the ancillary data, if the event date is in the past but there's no verifiable information, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted. However, the predictions in the search results (e.g., [1], [5], [14]) suggest the Stars were favored, but predictions aren't factual outcomes. \n\nSince there's no confirmed result, the resolution should default to p4, indicating insufficient information to resolve the market. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nThe NHL game between the Anaheim Ducks and Dallas Stars was scheduled for **March 18, 2025, at 8:00 PM ET** (March 19, 2025, 00:00 UTC). The current timestamp provided is **March 19, 2025, 02:44:45 UTC**, which is **2 hours and 44 minutes after the scheduled start time**.  \n\n### Key Analysis:  \n1. **Event Timing**:  \n   - The game\u2019s scheduled time (March 18, 8:00 PM ET / March 19, 00:00 UTC) precedes the current timestamp (March 19, 02:44:45 UTC). This places the event in the past.  \n\n2. **Verification of Outcome**:  \n   - **No conclusive evidence** of the game\u2019s outcome exists in the provided search results. All sources either:  \n     - Discuss **pre-game predictions** (e.g., [1][3][5][7][10][11][14]).  \n     - Reference a **previous matchup** on February 4, 2025, where the Ducks won 2-1 [2][6][13].  \n     - Provide **live odds or stats** without final scores [9][12].  \n\n3. **Ancillary Data Alignment**:  \n   - The resolution conditions specify:  \n     - **p1 (Stars win)**, **p2 (Ducks win)**, or **p3 (canceled/postponed)**.  \n   - Without verified reports of a postponement, cancellation, or final score, the outcome cannot be definitively determined.  \n\n### Resolution:  \nPer UMA\u2019s protocol, if an event\u2019s outcome cannot be verified despite occurring in the past, the default resolution is **p4** (insufficient data). Predictions and historical trends (e.g., Stars\u2019 strong home record [1][5][14]) are irrelevant to factual resolution.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",
