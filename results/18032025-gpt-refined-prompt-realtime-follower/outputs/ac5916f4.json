Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes.

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this UMA oracle resolution request. The user wants to determine the outcome of the North Carolina vs. San Diego State basketball game scheduled for March 18, 2025, at 9:10 PM ET. The current timestamp given is March 19, 2025, 03:34:56 UTC, which is the next day. So the event should have already occurred. \n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any information confirming the game's result. Let's go through the sources. \n\nLooking at the search results, source [9] from CBS Sports has a final score: North Carolina 95, San Diego State 68. The article states that UNC won and advanced to the next round. That's a clear verification. Another source, [12], also mentions a prediction of UNC winning 75-69, but that's a prediction before the game. However, [9] is a post-game report, so it's reliable. \n\nOther sources like [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [10], [11], [13] are all previews or pre-game analyses, so they don't have the result. Source [9] is the only one with the final score. \n\nThe ancillary data specifies that if North Carolina wins, the market resolves to p2. Since the verified outcome is a UNC victory, the recommendation should be p2. No conflicting information found, so no disputes here. The game wasn't postponed or canceled, so p3 isn't applicable. \n\nTherefore, based on the verified result in source [9], the resolution is p2.\n</think>\n\nThe NCAA men's basketball game between North Carolina and San Diego State occurred on March 18, 2025, at 9:10 PM ET. Verified post-game reports confirm North Carolina defeated San Diego State with a final score of 95-68[9]. This outcome meets the resolution conditions outlined in the ancillary data, where a North Carolina victory corresponds to resolution p2. \n\nrecommendation: p2",
