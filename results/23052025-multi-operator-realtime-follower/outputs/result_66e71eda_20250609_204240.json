The ad content and links don't help here.\n\n2. **Search result [2]**: A transcript from a Trump rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania. The date isn't clear, but the transcript includes Trump saying \"What the hell have you done...\" and \"get the hell off that couch.\" However, this might be from a different event. Need to confirm the date.\n\n3. **Search result [3]**: Live coverage of the Pittsburgh rally. The transcript snippet mentions Trump talking about the US Steel deal but doesn't include \"hell.\"\n\n4. **Search result [4]**: Another LiveNOW video mentioning tariff increases. No transcript provided.\n\n5. **Search result [5]**: ABC News article about a 2024 rally. Not relevant to the 2025 event.\n\n6. **Search result [6]**: Politico article about a 2024 rally. Again, not the correct date.\n\n7. **Search result [7]**: CBS News video from 2015. Too old.\n\n8. **Search result [8]**: CBS News about Kamala Harris's speech in 2024. Not relevant.\n\n9. **Search result [9]**: PublicSource article on the Pittsburgh rally. Mentions Trump's speech but no direct quotes with \"hell.\"\n\n10. **Search result [10]**: Transcript from a 100-day rally. Different event.\n\n11. **Search result [11]**: YouTube video snippet. Trump says, \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" This is from the Pittsburgh rally.\n\n12. **Search result [12]**: Politico article from 2024. Not relevant.\n\n13. **Search result [13]**: WHCA document. Doesn't help.\n\n14. **Search result [14]**: YouTube transcript. Trump says, \"get the hell out\" and \"What the hell did I do...\" but need to check if this is from the May 30 rally.\n\n15. **Search result [15]**: DailyMotion video clips. One clip titled \"Trump Slams USW's McCall During PA Rally: 'I Don't Think He Know What The Hell He's Talking About'\" which matches the May 30 event.\n\n16. **Search result [16]**: Politico article mentioning \"hell hole\" but from 2024.\n\n17. **Search result [17]**: Philadelphia rally transcript. Different event.\n\n18. **Search result [18]**: Transcript from the U.S. Steel rally. Trump says, \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about\" and \"get the hell off that couch.\"\n\nFrom these, the key sources are [11], [14], [15], and [18]. Each of these mentions Trump using \"hell\" at the Pittsburgh rally. Let's count the instances:\n\n1. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [11][15][18]\n2. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [2][18]\n3. \"What the hell have you done...\" [2]\n4. \"What the hell did I do...\" [14]\n5. \"Who the hell is Harris?\" [12] (But this is from a different event in 2024)\n6. \"Third World hell hole\" [16] (Different event)\n\nWait, need to ensure all instances are from the May 30, 2025 rally. The transcript in [18] is from the U.S. Steel rally on May 30. In that transcript, Trump says \"hell\" at least twice. The [2] transcript is from Indiana, PA, but the date isn't specified. However, [18] is the correct event. The [14] transcript mentions \"get the hell out\" but the date isn't clear. The [15] video confirms one instance. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the May 30, 2025 rally. The sources [3], [9], [11], [15], and [18] are about that specific event. From [18], the transcript shows:\n\n- \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" (1)\n- \"get the hell off that couch.\" (2)\n- \"What the hell have you done...\" (3)\n- \"Who the hell is Harris?\" (4) \u2013 but this might be from a different part.\n\nWait, looking at [18]'s transcript, the exact quotes are:\n\n- \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [18]\n- \"get the hell off that couch.\" [18]\n- \"What the hell have you done...\" [18]\n\nWait, in the [18] transcript, the full context shows multiple instances. Let me parse it carefully:\n\nIn [18], Trump says:\n\n1. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" \n2. \"get the hell off that couch.\"\n3. \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\"\n\nWait, but looking at the actual [18] transcript provided, the exact lines are:\n\nFrom [18]: \n\nDonald Trump (41:32): ... \"get the hell off that couch.\" \n\nLater: \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\"\n\nAnother part: \"What the hell have you done...\"\n\nWait, the user's search result [2] is a transcript from Indiana, PA, but the date isn't specified. However, the user's query is about the May 30, 2025 rally. The [18] transcript is explicitly from the U.S. Steel rally on May 30, 2025. In that transcript, Trump uses \"hell\" multiple times:\n\n1. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [18]\n2. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [18]\n3. \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\" [18]\n\nAdditionally, in [14], the transcript snippet includes \"get the hell out of here\" but it's unclear if that's from the same event. However, [15] clearly references the May 30 rally with the \"hell\" quote.\n\nSo, in total, from the provided sources specific to the May 30 event, Trump used \"hell\" at least three times. However, the user needs seven instances. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at [18]'s full transcript:\n\n- \"get the hell off that couch.\" (1)\n- \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" (2)\n- \"What the hell have you done...\" (3)\n- \"Who the hell is Harris?\" (4) \u2013 but this is from a different event in [12], which is August 2024.\n\nWait, no, in [18], the transcript includes:\n\nDonald Trump (41:32): ... \"get the hell off that couch.\"\n\nLater: \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\"\n\nAnother part: \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\"\n\nSo that's three instances. Additionally, in [2], the transcript from Indiana, PA (date unclear) has \"get the hell off that couch\" and \"What the hell have you done...\", but if that's the same event as May 30, then it's the same instances. However, [2] might be a different rally. The user's query is specifically about the May 30 rally, so only the sources that explicitly mention May 30 count.\n\nIn [9], the article mentions Trump's speech in West Mifflin on May 30, quoting him saying \"get them the hell out,\" which is another instance. So that's four.\n\nIn [14], the transcript snippet includes \"get him the hell out of here,\" but that's from a 2015 event, so irrelevant.\n\nIn [15], the video titled \"Trump Slams USW's McCall During PA Rally: 'I Don\u2019t Think He Know What The Hell He's Talking About'\" is from May 30, adding another instance (but already counted in [18]).\n\nWait, perhaps the [9] article quotes Trump saying \"get them the hell out\" during the May 30 rally. That would be instance 4.\n\nIn [18], the transcript also includes:\n\n\"And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement [Applause] officer. Right. USA, USA, USA. And I will ban all sanctuary cities in the United States of [Applause] {ts:1913.88} America. And I am going to immediately do something that nobody's ever heard before. And I've wanted to do it for a long time, but I don't want these guys to do it because they won'... 'm going to have here and I have one left the whole thing and remember the rallies are the most exciting thing. There'll never be rallies like this. You know {ts:2870.4} you're going to have some leading candidate come in in four years and honestly if they're successful they'll have 300 or 400 people in a ballroom. places. These This is never going to happen again. It happens every single time. And it's never happened in the world. It's there's never been This is a movement that's never happened. And it's going to be a movement that's going to save our country. It's going to be a movement that's going to save. But it's sad in terms of we'll never have this, but we'll have other gettogethers. And in a way all what we're doing all these years of work and you know we started off with that very bad situation four years ago and it was so it was so sickening to wait four years and if I didn't do so well that's I did so much {ts:2921.44} better the second time than the first I wouldn't have done this if I you know if I took in less votes we took in close to 12 million more votes. I mean Obama Barack Hussein Obama he didn't do that. He got far less votes the second time and he won. And he\"\n\nNo \"hell\" here. \n\nWait, in [9], the article says: \"Trump called out to numerous conservative political figures in the audience, and invited three attendees to the stage: former Steeler running back Rocky Bleier, current quarterback Mason Rudolph and safety Miles Killebrew.\" No \"hell\" there.\n\nWait, the [9] article quotes Trump as saying: \u201cYou have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out. I\u2019m sorry. Get them out. Can\u2019t have it. Can\u2019t have it. They\u2019ve destroyed it.\u201d This is during the May 30 rally. So that's another instance: \"get them the hell out.\" That's instance 4.\n\nSo far, instances from May 30 rally:\n\n1. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [18]\n2. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [18][15]\n3. \"What the hell have you done...\" [18]\n4. \"get them the hell out.\" [9]\n\nWait, but in [18], the transcript includes:\n\nDonald Trump (41:32): ... \"get the hell off that couch.\"\n\nLater: \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\"\n\nAnother part: \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\"\n\nSo that's three instances in [18]. Then in [9], another instance: \"get them the hell out.\" Total of four.\n\nAre there more? Let's check [14] again. The transcript in [14] includes:\n\n\"Camala, you're fired. Get out. Get out. You're fired. [Applause] See, I consider all those guys back there with the big muscles, and it's not my thing, but I consider them really beautiful to me. They're beautiful people, and they are productive people. They make our country work and run. They built our country. They did. And then you had stupid politicians that let them down and those companies got taken out of Pittsburgh and every place {ts:913.24} else like you take candy away from a baby. But now we have the exact opposite. If we win Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing. It's very simple. And I do believe it is. I say you have to make I do believe it is too big to rig. I think it's too big to rig. They'll try and they are trying you know though it's too big to rig. This is a big movement. This is you know we did great in 2016. We did much better in 2020 but a lot of bad things happened. He turned out to be a brilliant candidate from his basement that nobody ever heard. No, this is that big powerful vicious party though. No, it... 't shoot them because that's too quick. They sliced them up and left them dead. Two young, beautiful girls walking to school and ICE did their business. ICE went in and took care of them. But can you imagine? And now she wants to {ts:1838.159} defund ICE. Let's defund ICE. No, these are these are rough people. These are bad people. I will invoke, and this is how far we had to go back because in those days they didn't play games. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement [Applause] officer. Right. USA, USA, USA. And I will ban all sanctuary cities in the United States of [Applause] {ts:1913.88} America. And I am going to immediately do something that nobody's ever heard before.

And he\"\n\nNo \"hell\" here. \n\nWait, in [18], the transcript also includes:\n\nDonald Trump (01:10:29): \"I have to tell you that this is an incredible deal for American steelworkers and it includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving. US Steel will maintain.\"\n\nCrowd (01:10:54): \"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.\"\n\nDonald Trump (01:11:07): \"I don't want to fight with those guys. They look pretty\u2026 I'll never fight. US Steel will maintain all of its current operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of the next 10 years, and we have that as a commitment, but I don't even think you have to worry about that. You're not going to have to even think about that. Frankly, it won't matter because they're going to be here for a long time, a lot longer than that. There will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever. And every US steelworker will soon receive a well-deserved $5,000 bonus. That's very rare. Thank you very much. That's great. That's importantly for what you've gone through. You've gone through a lot. It's closing. It's not closing, it's opening, and you want to stay here. People say, \"Well, we'll move to another place and we'll do chips, so we'll do something like chips.\"\"\n\nNo \"hell\" here.\n\nSo, total instances from the May 30 rally:\n\n1. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [18]\n2. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [18][15]\n3. \"What the hell have you done...\" [18]\n4. \"get them the hell out.\" [9]\n\nThat's four instances. The user needs seven. Are there more?\n\nLooking at [2] again, the transcript is from Indiana, PA, but the date isn't specified. If that's the same rally, then:\n\n5. \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\" [2]\n6. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [2]\n\nBut if [2] is a different rally, those don't count. The user's query is about the May 30 event. The [2] transcript's URL says \"trump-rally-in-indiana-pennsylvania\" which is a different location from Pittsburgh. So, different event. Therefore, those instances don't count.\n\nThus, only four instances are confirmed from the May 30 rally. However, the user's query requires seven. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed some in the [18] transcript. Let me check again:\n\nIn [18], the full transcript includes:\n\n- \"get the hell off that couch.\" (1)\n- \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" (2)\n- \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\" (3)\n- \"Who the hell is Harris?\" (4) \u2013 but this is from a different event in [12], which is August 2024.\n\nWait, no, in [18], the transcript doesn't mention \"Who the hell is Harris?\" That's from [12], which is a different rally. So, in [18], only three instances. Plus [9]'s \"get them the hell out\" makes four.\n\nAre there any other mentions? Let's check [11]:\n\n[11] is a YouTube video snippet where Trump says, \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" That's the same as instance 2.\n\n[15] is a video titled \"Trump Slams USW's McCall During PA Rally: 'I Don\u2019t Think He Know What The Hell He's Talking About'\" which is the May 30 event, confirming instance 2.\n\nSo, total four instances. The user needs seven. Therefore, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). However, maybe I missed some instances in the transcripts. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in [18], the transcript has:\n\nDonald Trump (01:10:29): \"And by the way, your local union, I won't talk about your national union because I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about, but your local union, I want to tell you is so unbelievable. They've been great.\"\n\nThat's instance 2.\n\nEarlier in [18]:\n\nDonald Trump (41:32): \"Thank you very much. What a group of people. We love this group. You voted for me. They never had a chance in Pennsylvania. They never even had a chance.\n\n(41:41)\n\nBut I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth at the legendary Mon Valley Works. Irvin plant, Irvin plant, with the proud Pennsylvania Patriots who are the heart and soul of US Steel. Thank you very much. That's great.\n\n(41:59)\n\nOh, you're going to be happy. You're going to be happy. There's a lot of money coming your way. It's a lot of money. You're going to say, \"Please, sir, we don't want this kind of success. It's too much, sir. We can't take it. Please, we beg you. We don't want this much success.\"\n\n(42:14)\n\nBut we do, really, don't we? We're going to be so successful. You have just started. You're going to watch. We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company. You're going to stay an American company. You know that, right?\n\n(42:32)\n\nBut we're going to have a great partner. We're going to have a great partner. And I have to tell you, Japan has been a tremendous friend of mine during my years as president. And then we had a little hiatus. We had a rigged election, but then we won. We said, \"Let's make it too big to rig.\" And then made it too big to rig. And this is a much more powerful term than we could have ever had the other way.... I said, \"What can we do?\" Because all the steel companies were going south. They were all in trouble.\n\n(44:24)\n\nHe said, \"If you could get tariffs, sir, and save this company.\"\n\n(44:28)\n\nAnd I thought about it. I studied it up real quick. It took me about two minutes. And I said, \"Dave, I think we're going to make you very happy.\"\n\n(44:35)\n\nAnd we did make you happy, didn't we? We saved the company. We put 25% tariffs on your company. So, we had protection. We were protected from outside horrible influence, including dumping, where they were dumping steel all over the United States. And we saved it. It was a great honor, and Dave was really the first one that brought it to my attention, and I appreciate it, Dave. You did a good job. You did a good job.\n\n(45:04)... (01:09:48)\n\nAnd the bulk, these expenditures will be made in the next 14 months. It's going to happen fast. You're going to be very busy watching trucks go back and forth loaded up with cash or it's equivalent, and it will create and save over 100,000 American jobs, including 14,000 jobs in Pennsylvania. Thank you. Very good. And by the way, your local union, I won't talk about your national union because I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about, but your local union, I want to tell you is so unbelievable. They've been great.\n\n(01:10:29)\n\nI have to tell you that this is an incredible deal for American steelworkers and it includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving. US Steel will maintain.\n\nCrowd (01:10:54):\n\nUSA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.\n\nDonald Trump (01:11:07):\n\nI don't want to fight with those guys.

People say, \"Well, we'll move to another place and we'll do chips, so we'll do something like chips.\"\n\nNo additional \"hell\" instances here.\n\nIn [9], the article quotes Trump saying: \u201cYou have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out. I\u2019m sorry. Get them out. Can\u2019t have it. Can\u2019t have it. They\u2019ve destroyed it.\u201d That's one instance.\n\nSo total four instances. Therefore, the answer is \"No\" (p1) since it's less than seven. However, the user's search results might have more instances that I missed. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in [18], the transcript also includes:\n\nDonald Trump (01:10:29): \"And by the way, your local union, I won't talk about your national union because I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about, but your local union, I want to tell you is so unbelievable.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749501509 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 20:38:29 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said \"Hell\" seven or more times during his Pittsburgh rally on May 30, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that any usage of \"hell\" counts, including plural or possessive forms, but not other variations. The resolution is based on the main speech at the event, including Q&A, but not other comments outside of it.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for transcripts or mentions of the rally. Let's go through each source:\n\n1. **Search result [1]**: This is a YouTube link about the rally announcement. The description mentions Trump's announcement but doesn't provide a transcript. The ad content and links don't help here.\n\n2. **Search result [2]**: A transcript from a Trump rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania. The date isn't clear, but the transcript includes Trump saying \"What the hell have you done...\" and \"get the hell off that couch.\" However, this might be from a different event. Need to confirm the date.\n\n3. **Search result [3]**: Live coverage of the Pittsburgh rally. The transcript snippet mentions Trump talking about the US Steel deal but doesn't include \"hell.\"\n\n4. **Search result [4]**: Another LiveNOW video mentioning tariff increases. No transcript provided.\n\n5. **Search result [5]**: ABC News article about a 2024 rally. Not relevant to the 2025 event.\n\n6. **Search result [6]**: Politico article about a 2024 rally. Again, not the correct date.\n\n7. **Search result [7]**: CBS News video from 2015. Too old.\n\n8. **Search result [8]**: CBS News about Kamala Harris's speech in 2024. Not relevant.\n\n9. **Search result [9]**: PublicSource article on the Pittsburgh rally. Mentions Trump's speech but no direct quotes with \"hell.\"\n\n10. **Search result [10]**: Transcript from a 100-day rally. Different event.\n\n11. **Search result [11]**: YouTube video snippet. Trump says, \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" This is from the Pittsburgh rally.\n\n12. **Search result [12]**: Politico article from 2024. Not relevant.\n\n13. **Search result [13]**: WHCA document. Doesn't help.\n\n14. **Search result [14]**: YouTube transcript. Trump says, \"get the hell out\" and \"What the hell did I do...\" but need to check if this is from the May 30 rally.\n\n15. **Search result [15]**: DailyMotion video clips. One clip titled \"Trump Slams USW's McCall During PA Rally: 'I Don't Think He Know What The Hell He's Talking About'\" which matches the May 30 event.\n\n16. **Search result [16]**: Politico article mentioning \"hell hole\" but from 2024.\n\n17. **Search result [17]**: Philadelphia rally transcript. Different event.\n\n18. **Search result [18]**: Transcript from the U.S. Steel rally. Trump says, \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about\" and \"get the hell off that couch.\"\n\nFrom these, the key sources are [11], [14], [15], and [18]. Each of these mentions Trump using \"hell\" at the Pittsburgh rally. Let's count the instances:\n\n1. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [11][15][18]\n2. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [2][18]\n3. \"What the hell have you done...\" [2]\n4. \"What the hell did I do...\" [14]\n5. \"Who the hell is Harris?\" [12] (But this is from a different event in 2024)\n6. \"Third World hell hole\" [16] (Different event)\n\nWait, need to ensure all instances are from the May 30, 2025 rally. The transcript in [18] is from the U.S. Steel rally on May 30. In that transcript, Trump says \"hell\" at least twice. The [2] transcript is from Indiana, PA, but the date isn't specified. However, [18] is the correct event. The [14] transcript mentions \"get the hell out\" but the date isn't clear. The [15] video confirms one instance. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the May 30, 2025 rally. The sources [3], [9], [11], [15], and [18] are about that specific event. From [18], the transcript shows:\n\n- \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" (1)\n- \"get the hell off that couch.\" (2)\n- \"What the hell have you done...\" (3)\n- \"Who the hell is Harris?\" (4) \u2013 but this might be from a different part.\n\nWait, looking at [18]'s transcript, the exact quotes are:\n\n- \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [18]\n- \"get the hell off that couch.\" [18]\n- \"What the hell have you done...\" [18]\n\nWait, in the [18] transcript, the full context shows multiple instances. Let me parse it carefully:\n\nIn [18], Trump says:\n\n1. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" \n2. \"get the hell off that couch.\"\n3. \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\"\n\nWait, but looking at the actual [18] transcript provided, the exact lines are:\n\nFrom [18]: \n\nDonald Trump (41:32): ... \"get the hell off that couch.\" \n\nLater: \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\"\n\nAnother part: \"What the hell have you done...\"\n\nWait, the user's search result [2] is a transcript from Indiana, PA, but the date isn't specified. However, the user's query is about the May 30, 2025 rally. The [18] transcript is explicitly from the U.S. Steel rally on May 30, 2025. In that transcript, Trump uses \"hell\" multiple times:\n\n1. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [18]\n2. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [18]\n3. \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\" [18]\n\nAdditionally, in [14], the transcript snippet includes \"get the hell out of here\" but it's unclear if that's from the same event. However, [15] clearly references the May 30 rally with the \"hell\" quote.\n\nSo, in total, from the provided sources specific to the May 30 event, Trump used \"hell\" at least three times. However, the user needs seven instances. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at [18]'s full transcript:\n\n- \"get the hell off that couch.\" (1)\n- \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" (2)\n- \"What the hell have you done...\" (3)\n- \"Who the hell is Harris?\" (4) \u2013 but this is from a different event in [12], which is August 2024.\n\nWait, no, in [18], the transcript includes:\n\nDonald Trump (41:32): ... \"get the hell off that couch.\"\n\nLater: \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\"\n\nAnother part: \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\"\n\nSo that's three instances. Additionally, in [2], the transcript from Indiana, PA (date unclear) has \"get the hell off that couch\" and \"What the hell have you done...\", but if that's the same event as May 30, then it's the same instances. However, [2] might be a different rally. The user's query is specifically about the May 30 rally, so only the sources that explicitly mention May 30 count.\n\nIn [9], the article mentions Trump's speech in West Mifflin on May 30, quoting him saying \"get them the hell out,\" which is another instance. So that's four.\n\nIn [14], the transcript snippet includes \"get him the hell out of here,\" but that's from a 2015 event, so irrelevant.\n\nIn [15], the video titled \"Trump Slams USW's McCall During PA Rally: 'I Don\u2019t Think He Know What The Hell He's Talking About'\" is from May 30, adding another instance (but already counted in [18]).\n\nWait, perhaps the [9] article quotes Trump saying \"get them the hell out\" during the May 30 rally. That would be instance 4.\n\nIn [18], the transcript also includes:\n\n\"And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement [Applause] officer. Right. USA, USA, USA. And I will ban all sanctuary cities in the United States of [Applause] {ts:1913.88} America. And I am going to immediately do something that nobody's ever heard before. And I've wanted to do it for a long time, but I don't want these guys to do it because they won'... 'm going to have here and I have one left the whole thing and remember the rallies are the most exciting thing. There'll never be rallies like this. You know {ts:2870.4} you're going to have some leading candidate come in in four years and honestly if they're successful they'll have 300 or 400 people in a ballroom. places. These This is never going to happen again. It happens every single time. And it's never happened in the world. It's there's never been This is a movement that's never happened. And it's going to be a movement that's going to save our country. It's going to be a movement that's going to save. But it's sad in terms of we'll never have this, but we'll have other gettogethers. And in a way all what we're doing all these years of work and you know we started off with that very bad situation four years ago and it was so it was so sickening to wait four years and if I didn't do so well that's I did so much {ts:2921.44} better the second time than the first I wouldn't have done this if I you know if I took in less votes we took in close to 12 million more votes. I mean Obama Barack Hussein Obama he didn't do that. He got far less votes the second time and he won. And he\"\n\nNo \"hell\" here. \n\nWait, in [9], the article says: \"Trump called out to numerous conservative political figures in the audience, and invited three attendees to the stage: former Steeler running back Rocky Bleier, current quarterback Mason Rudolph and safety Miles Killebrew.\" No \"hell\" there.\n\nWait, the [9] article quotes Trump as saying: \u201cYou have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out. I\u2019m sorry. Get them out. Can\u2019t have it. Can\u2019t have it. They\u2019ve destroyed it.\u201d This is during the May 30 rally. So that's another instance: \"get them the hell out.\" That's instance 4.\n\nSo far, instances from May 30 rally:\n\n1. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [18]\n2. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [18][15]\n3. \"What the hell have you done...\" [18]\n4. \"get them the hell out.\" [9]\n\nWait, but in [18], the transcript includes:\n\nDonald Trump (41:32): ... \"get the hell off that couch.\"\n\nLater: \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\"\n\nAnother part: \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\"\n\nSo that's three instances in [18]. Then in [9], another instance: \"get them the hell out.\" Total of four.\n\nAre there more? Let's check [14] again. The transcript in [14] includes:\n\n\"Camala, you're fired. Get out. Get out. You're fired. [Applause] See, I consider all those guys back there with the big muscles, and it's not my thing, but I consider them really beautiful to me. They're beautiful people, and they are productive people. They make our country work and run. They built our country. They did. And then you had stupid politicians that let them down and those companies got taken out of Pittsburgh and every place {ts:913.24} else like you take candy away from a baby. But now we have the exact opposite. If we win Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing. It's very simple. And I do believe it is. I say you have to make I do believe it is too big to rig. I think it's too big to rig. They'll try and they are trying you know though it's too big to rig. This is a big movement. This is you know we did great in 2016. We did much better in 2020 but a lot of bad things happened. He turned out to be a brilliant candidate from his basement that nobody ever heard. No, this is that big powerful vicious party though. No, it... 't shoot them because that's too quick. They sliced them up and left them dead. Two young, beautiful girls walking to school and ICE did their business. ICE went in and took care of them. But can you imagine? And now she wants to {ts:1838.159} defund ICE. Let's defund ICE. No, these are these are rough people. These are bad people. I will invoke, and this is how far we had to go back because in those days they didn't play games. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement [Applause] officer. Right. USA, USA, USA. And I will ban all sanctuary cities in the United States of [Applause] {ts:1913.88} America. And I am going to immediately do something that nobody's ever heard before.

And he\"\n\nNo \"hell\" here. \n\nWait, in [18], the transcript also includes:\n\nDonald Trump (01:10:29): \"I have to tell you that this is an incredible deal for American steelworkers and it includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving. US Steel will maintain.\"\n\nCrowd (01:10:54): \"USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.\"\n\nDonald Trump (01:11:07): \"I don't want to fight with those guys. They look pretty\u2026 I'll never fight. US Steel will maintain all of its current operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of the next 10 years, and we have that as a commitment, but I don't even think you have to worry about that. You're not going to have to even think about that. Frankly, it won't matter because they're going to be here for a long time, a lot longer than that. There will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever. And every US steelworker will soon receive a well-deserved $5,000 bonus. That's very rare. Thank you very much. That's great. That's importantly for what you've gone through. You've gone through a lot. It's closing. It's not closing, it's opening, and you want to stay here. People say, \"Well, we'll move to another place and we'll do chips, so we'll do something like chips.\"\"\n\nNo \"hell\" here.\n\nSo, total instances from the May 30 rally:\n\n1. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [18]\n2. \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" [18][15]\n3. \"What the hell have you done...\" [18]\n4. \"get them the hell out.\" [9]\n\nThat's four instances. The user needs seven. Are there more?\n\nLooking at [2] again, the transcript is from Indiana, PA, but the date isn't specified. If that's the same rally, then:\n\n5. \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\" [2]\n6. \"get the hell off that couch.\" [2]\n\nBut if [2] is a different rally, those don't count. The user's query is about the May 30 event. The [2] transcript's URL says \"trump-rally-in-indiana-pennsylvania\" which is a different location from Pittsburgh. So, different event. Therefore, those instances don't count.\n\nThus, only four instances are confirmed from the May 30 rally. However, the user's query requires seven. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed some in the [18] transcript. Let me check again:\n\nIn [18], the full transcript includes:\n\n- \"get the hell off that couch.\" (1)\n- \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" (2)\n- \"What the hell have you done other than collect the check?\" (3)\n- \"Who the hell is Harris?\" (4) \u2013 but this is from a different event in [12], which is August 2024.\n\nWait, no, in [18], the transcript doesn't mention \"Who the hell is Harris?\" That's from [12], which is a different rally. So, in [18], only three instances. Plus [9]'s \"get them the hell out\" makes four.\n\nAre there any other mentions? Let's check [11]:\n\n[11] is a YouTube video snippet where Trump says, \"I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about.\" That's the same as instance 2.\n\n[15] is a video titled \"Trump Slams USW's McCall During PA Rally: 'I Don\u2019t Think He Know What The Hell He's Talking About'\" which is the May 30 event, confirming instance 2.\n\nSo, total four instances. The user needs seven. Therefore, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). However, maybe I missed some instances in the transcripts. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in [18], the transcript has:\n\nDonald Trump (01:10:29): \"And by the way, your local union, I won't talk about your national union because I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about, but your local union, I want to tell you is so unbelievable. They've been great.\"\n\nThat's instance 2.\n\nEarlier in [18]:\n\nDonald Trump (41:32): \"Thank you very much. What a group of people. We love this group. You voted for me. They never had a chance in Pennsylvania. They never even had a chance.\n\n(41:41)\n\nBut I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth at the legendary Mon Valley Works. Irvin plant, Irvin plant, with the proud Pennsylvania Patriots who are the heart and soul of US Steel. Thank you very much. That's great.\n\n(41:59)\n\nOh, you're going to be happy. You're going to be happy. There's a lot of money coming your way. It's a lot of money. You're going to say, \"Please, sir, we don't want this kind of success. It's too much, sir. We can't take it. Please, we beg you. We don't want this much success.\"\n\n(42:14)\n\nBut we do, really, don't we? We're going to be so successful. You have just started. You're going to watch. We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company. You're going to stay an American company. You know that, right?\n\n(42:32)\n\nBut we're going to have a great partner. We're going to have a great partner. And I have to tell you, Japan has been a tremendous friend of mine during my years as president. And then we had a little hiatus. We had a rigged election, but then we won. We said, \"Let's make it too big to rig.\" And then made it too big to rig. And this is a much more powerful term than we could have ever had the other way.... I said, \"What can we do?\" Because all the steel companies were going south. They were all in trouble.\n\n(44:24)\n\nHe said, \"If you could get tariffs, sir, and save this company.\"\n\n(44:28)\n\nAnd I thought about it. I studied it up real quick. It took me about two minutes. And I said, \"Dave, I think we're going to make you very happy.\"\n\n(44:35)\n\nAnd we did make you happy, didn't we? We saved the company. We put 25% tariffs on your company. So, we had protection. We were protected from outside horrible influence, including dumping, where they were dumping steel all over the United States. And we saved it. It was a great honor, and Dave was really the first one that brought it to my attention, and I appreciate it, Dave. You did a good job. You did a good job.\n\n(45:04)... (01:09:48)\n\nAnd the bulk, these expenditures will be made in the next 14 months. It's going to happen fast. You're going to be very busy watching trucks go back and forth loaded up with cash or it's equivalent, and it will create and save over 100,000 American jobs, including 14,000 jobs in Pennsylvania. Thank you. Very good. And by the way, your local union, I won't talk about your national union because I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about, but your local union, I want to tell you is so unbelievable. They've been great.\n\n(01:10:29)\n\nI have to tell you that this is an incredible deal for American steelworkers and it includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving. US Steel will maintain.\n\nCrowd (01:10:54):\n\nUSA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.\n\nDonald Trump (01:11:07):\n\nI don't want to fight with those guys.

People say, \"Well, we'll move to another place and we'll do chips, so we'll do something like chips.\"\n\nNo additional \"hell\" instances here.\n\nIn [9], the article quotes Trump saying: \u201cYou have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out. I\u2019m sorry. Get them out. Can\u2019t have it. Can\u2019t have it. They\u2019ve destroyed it.\u201d That's one instance.\n\nSo total four instances. Therefore, the answer is \"No\" (p1) since it's less than seven. However, the user's search results might have more instances that I missed. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in [18], the transcript also includes:\n\nDonald Trump (01:10:29): \"And by the way, your local union, I won't talk about your national union because I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about, but your local union, I want to tell you is so unbelievable. They've been great.\"\n\nThat's instance 2.\n\nAnother part:\n\nDonald Trump (41:32): \"Thank you very much. What a group of people. We love this group. You voted for me. They never had a chance in Pennsylvania. They never even had a chance.\n\n(41:41)\n\nBut I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth at the legendary Mon Valley Works. Irvin plant, Irvin plant, with the proud Pennsylvania Patriots who are the heart and soul of US Steel. Thank you very much. That's great.\n\n(41:59)\n\nOh, you're going to be happy. You're going to be happy. There's a lot of money coming your way. It's a lot of money. You're going to say, \"Please, sir, we don't want this kind of success. It's too much, sir. We can't take it. Please, we beg you. We don't want this much success.\"\n\n(42:14)\n\nBut we do, really, don't we? We're going to be so successful. You have just started. You're going to watch. We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company. You're going to stay an American company. You know that, right?\n\n(42:32)\n\nBut we're going to have a great partner. We're going to have a great partner. And I have to tell you, Japan has been a tremendous friend of mine during my years as president. And then we had a little hiatus. We had a rigged election, but then we won. We said, \"Let's make it too big to rig.\" And then made it too big to rig. And this is a much more powerful term than we could have ever had the other way.... I said, \"What can we do?\" Because all the steel companies were going south. They were all in trouble.\n\n(44:24)\n\nHe said, \"If you could get tariffs, sir, and save this company.\"\n\n(44:28)\n\nAnd I thought about it. I studied it up real quick. It took me about two minutes. And I said, \"Dave, I think we're going to make you very happy.\"\n\n(44:35)\n\nAnd we did make you happy, didn't we? We saved the company. We put 25% tariffs on your company. So, we had protection. We were protected from outside horrible influence, including dumping, where they were dumping steel all over the United States. And we saved it. It was a great honor, and Dave was really the first one that brought it to my attention, and I appreciate it, Dave. You did a good job. You did a good job.\n\n(45:04)... (01:09:48)\n\nAnd the bulk, these expenditures will be made in the next 14 months. It's going to happen fast. You're going to be very busy watching trucks go back and forth loaded up with cash or it's equivalent, and it will create and save over 100,000 American jobs, including 14,000 jobs in Pennsylvania. Thank you. Very good. And by the way, your local union, I won't talk about your national union because I don't think he knows what the hell he's talking about, but your local union, I want to tell you is so unbelievable. They've been great.\n\n(01:10:29)\n\nI have to tell you that this is an incredible deal for American steelworkers and it includes vital protections to ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving. US Steel will maintain.\n\nCrowd (01:10:54):\n\nUSA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.\n\nDonald Trump (01:11:07):\n\nI don't want to fight with those guys. They look pretty\u2026 I'll never fight. US Steel will maintain all of its current operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of the next 10 years, and we have that as a commitment, but I don't even think you have to worry about that. You're not going to have to even think about that. Frankly, it won't matter because they're going to be here for a long time, a lot longer than that. There will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever. And every US steelworker will soon receive a well-deserved $5,000 bonus. That's very rare. Thank you very much. That's great. That's importantly for what you've gone through. You've gone through a lot. It's closing. It's not closing, it's opening, and you want to stay here. People say, \"Well, we'll move to another place and we'll do chips, so we'll do something like chips.\"\n\nNo additional \"hell\" instances here.\n\nTherefore, the total confirmed instances are four. The user's query requires seven. Thus, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, if the transcripts provided are incomplete and there are more instances not captured in the search results, but based on the given data, it's four instances. Hence, the answer is p1: No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 41820397537263183439012594752812772441983575041860996821963310833900461748910, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 57220130320273239549364879219936824935884046342096606938907518546803409410302, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
