      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's hashprice dipped to $50.00 before June 2025, specifically between May 19 and May 31 in ET timezone. The resolution depends on data from Hashrate Index's Bitcoin Hashprice Index, looking for any bar at or below $49.99999.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for relevant data. The key sources here are the Hashrate Index pages. Search result [7] mentions a Hashrate Index Roundup from March 31, 2025, where the USD hashprice was $46.15 per PH/s/Day. That's below $50, but it's in March, which is outside the specified timeframe. The user's timeframe is May 19 to May 31, 2025. So that data point from March isn't relevant here.\n\nLooking at other search results, [10] and [12] explain the Hashprice Index and how it's calculated. The critical point is that the data must come from the specified URL with \"3M\", \"USD\", and \"PH/s\" selected. The user provided a link to the exact source, so I need to ensure that any data used is from that specific chart.\n\nHowever, the search results don't include any data points from May 2025. The latest data mentioned is in [7] from March 2025 and [5] from September 2024. Without specific data from May 19 to May 31, 2025, I can't confirm if the hashprice dipped below $50 during that period. \n\nThe user's instructions state that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past (which it is, as the current timestamp is June 10, 2025), we should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as \"Yes\" if the condition is met. But without data, we can't confirm it. However, the user also mentions that if the event is in the past and no info is available, we should infer based on the conditions. \n\nWait, the current date is June 10, 2025, so the event timeframe (May 19-31) has passed. If there's no data provided for that period, but the user specified that the resolution source is Hashrate Index, and the search results don't include that data, we have to assume that the data wasn't available in the provided context. According to the personalization rules, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, we resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the user's prompt conditions. The user's prompt says if no info, assume the most probable outcome unless contradicted. Since there's no data here, and the user's query is about whether it dipped below $50, but we can't confirm, the resolution would default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the instructions say if no info, default to p4. Wait, the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Here, the user's ancillary data defines p2 as \"Yes\" if the condition is met. But without data, we can't confirm. However, the user's prompt says the resolution depends solely on Hashrate Index's data. Since the provided search results don't include the relevant May 2025 data, we have to conclude that there's no verifiable information. Therefore, according to the instructions, we should resolve to p4. Wait, but the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data here defines p2 as \"Yes\" if the condition is met. But without data, how do we determine the most probable outcome? The user's query is about whether it dipped below $50. If we have no data, we can't assume it did. The default would be \"No\" unless proven otherwise. But the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the user's prompt don't provide a default; they just define the resolution criteria. Since the data isn't available, and the event is in the past, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past... and no verifiable information... resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt.\" But without data, how can we determine the probable outcome? The user's ancillary data doesn't specify a default. In this case, since the condition wasn't met (as there's no evidence), the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). But wait, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions state that if any bar in the timeframe is \u2264$49.99999, it's \"Yes\". If there's no data, does that mean the condition wasn't met? Or do we assume it might have happened? This is ambiguous. However, the resolution source is explicitly Hashrate Index. If the data from that source isn't available in the provided context, and the user hasn't provided any updates or URLs, then according to the rules, we can't verify it. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. But the personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis...\" The user did provide a URL (https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/bitcoin-hashprice-index), but the search results don't include data from that URL for May 2025. The available search results only go up to March 2025. Since the data isn't present, and the event is in the past, we have to resolve based on the lack of information. The instructions say if no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without data, the most probable outcome is that the condition wasn't met, hence \"No\" (p1). Alternatively, if the data isn't available, it's unresolved (p4). This is a bit conflicting. However, the personalization states: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the user's condition is that it resolves to \"Yes\" if any bar in the timeframe is \u2264$49.99999, and we have no data, we can't confirm it. Therefore, the absence of data means the condition wasn't met, so it resolves to \"No\" (p1). But wait, the user's prompt says the final bar within the timeframe is considered finalized once any June 1 bar is published. Since the current date is June 10, the data for May should be available. But in the provided search results, there's no data from May. Therefore, the resolution would be p4 because the data isn't available. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. If the hashprice was $46 in March, but we don't know May, maybe it's possible it stayed low. But that's speculative. The correct approach is to rely only on the provided data. Since there's no data for May, we can't confirm, so p4. But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 as \"Yes\" if the condition is met. If we have to assume, perhaps the most probable is that it didn't dip, but without data, it's unclear. This is a tough call. However, given the strict instructions to rely solely on the provided sources and the absence of May data, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome would be based on prior trends. In March, it was $46, but if difficulty increased or price dropped, maybe it went lower. Alternatively, if Bitcoin's price increased, hashprice might have risen. Without data, it's impossible to know. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749519717 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-10 01:41:57 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's hashprice dipped to $50.00 before June 2025, specifically between May 19 and May 31 in ET timezone. The resolution depends on data from Hashrate Index's Bitcoin Hashprice Index, looking for any bar at or below $49.99999.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for relevant data. The key sources here are the Hashrate Index pages. Search result [7] mentions a Hashrate Index Roundup from March 31, 2025, where the USD hashprice was $46.15 per PH/s/Day. That's below $50, but it's in March, which is outside the specified timeframe. The user's timeframe is May 19 to May 31, 2025. So that data point from March isn't relevant here.\n\nLooking at other search results, [10] and [12] explain the Hashprice Index and how it's calculated. The critical point is that the data must come from the specified URL with \"3M\", \"USD\", and \"PH/s\" selected. The user provided a link to the exact source, so I need to ensure that any data used is from that specific chart.\n\nHowever, the search results don't include any data points from May 2025. The latest data mentioned is in [7] from March 2025 and [5] from September 2024. Without specific data from May 19 to May 31, 2025, I can't confirm if the hashprice dipped below $50 during that period. \n\nThe user's instructions state that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past (which it is, as the current timestamp is June 10, 2025), we should assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as \"Yes\" if the condition is met. But without data, we can't confirm it. However, the user also mentions that if the event is in the past and no info is available, we should infer based on the conditions. \n\nWait, the current date is June 10, 2025, so the event timeframe (May 19-31) has passed. If there's no data provided for that period, but the user specified that the resolution source is Hashrate Index, and the search results don't include that data, we have to assume that the data wasn't available in the provided context. According to the personalization rules, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, we resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the user's prompt conditions. The user's prompt says if no info, assume the most probable outcome unless contradicted. Since there's no data here, and the user's query is about whether it dipped below $50, but we can't confirm, the resolution would default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the user's resolution_conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the instructions say if no info, default to p4. Wait, the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome... and the event date is in the past... assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Here, the user's ancillary data defines p2 as \"Yes\" if the condition is met. But without data, we can't confirm. However, the user's prompt says the resolution depends solely on Hashrate Index's data. Since the provided search results don't include the relevant May 2025 data, we have to conclude that there's no verifiable information. Therefore, according to the instructions, we should resolve to p4. Wait, but the personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data here defines p2 as \"Yes\" if the condition is met. But without data, how do we determine the most probable outcome? The user's query is about whether it dipped below $50. If we have no data, we can't assume it did. The default would be \"No\" unless proven otherwise. But the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the user's prompt don't provide a default; they just define the resolution criteria. Since the data isn't available, and the event is in the past, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot be resolved). However, the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past... and no verifiable information... resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt.\" But without data, how can we determine the probable outcome? The user's ancillary data doesn't specify a default. In this case, since the condition wasn't met (as there's no evidence), the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). But wait, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions state that if any bar in the timeframe is \u2264$49.99999, it's \"Yes\". If there's no data, does that mean the condition wasn't met? Or do we assume it might have happened? This is ambiguous. However, the resolution source is explicitly Hashrate Index. If the data from that source isn't available in the provided context, and the user hasn't provided any updates or URLs, then according to the rules, we can't verify it.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The resolution source is the Hashrate Index's Bitcoin Hashprice Index with specific settings: 3M, USD, PH/s.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for relevant data. The search results include multiple entries from Hashrate Index, including their blog posts and data pages. Looking at the dates, there are entries from May 2025. For example, the Hashrate Index Roundup on May 26, 2025 [7], mentions the USD hashprice increased to $57.10 per PH/s/Day. Another entry from May 12, 2025 [34] reports a hashprice of $55.17.

The May 26 report [7] states the hashprice was $57.10, which is well above $50. The May 5 report [5] is before the target period, so it's not relevant.

Result [40] mentions a hashprice of $52.43. All these are above $50. There's no mention of the hashprice dropping below $50 in the provided data within the specified timeframe. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends solely on Hashrate Index's data. Since all the available data points within the timeframe are above $50, the answer should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1.

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749519717 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-10 01:41:57 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's hashprice will dip to $50.00 before June 2025, specifically checking if any Hashrate Index bar between May 19 and May 31, 2025 (ET timezone) shows $49.99999 or lower. The resolution source is the Hashrate Index's Bitcoin Hashprice Index with specific settings: 3M, USD, PH/s.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for relevant data. The search results include multiple entries from Hashrate Index, including their blog posts and data pages. Looking at the dates, there are entries from May 2025. For example, the Hashrate Index Roundup on May 26, 2025 [7], mentions the USD hashprice increased to $57.10 per PH/s/Day. Another entry from May 12, 2025 [34] reports a hashprice of $55.17. The May 5, 2025 post [5] shows hashprice at $50.65, which is above $50. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the period from May 19 to May 31. The May 26 report [7] states the hashprice was $57.10, which is well above $50. The May 5 report [5] is before the target period, so it's not relevant. The June 2, 2025 post [32] mentions a forward market pricing average hashprice of $51.59 over the next six months, but that's a projection, not actual data. \n\nLooking at the data pages, result [38] from June 9, 2025, shows a spot hashprice of $52.83. Result [40] mentions a hashprice of $52.43. All these are above $50. There's no mention of the hashprice dropping below $50 in the provided data within the specified timeframe. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends solely on Hashrate Index's data. Since all the available data points within the timeframe are above $50, the answer should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1. However, the user's previous response was p4, so they want a recheck. \n\nI need to ensure there's no data point between May 19 and May 31 where hashprice dipped below $50. The search results don't show any such instance. The closest is May 5 at $50.65, which is still above. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0, ID: 37817763054999386894139304654349588893758417790000151197563720731305601569643, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 1, ID: 42933483890413800911035355505778189551765568433773854103233733052438938176341, Winner: Yes\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
