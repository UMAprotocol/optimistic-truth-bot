      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about resolving a prediction market regarding whether Iran will strike Israel between June 11 and June 16, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The user provided a bunch of search results from June 13, 2025, detailing Israeli strikes on Iran and Iran's retaliatory drone attacks.\n\nFirst, I need to check the dates. The market's timeframe is June 11 to June 16, 2025. The search results are all from June 13, 2025, which is within the window. The key points from the search results are that Israel conducted a major operation called \"Operation Rising Lion\" targeting Iran's nuclear and military sites on June 13. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel. The IDF intercepted these drones outside Israeli airspace, according to sources like CBS News and others.\n\nNow, the market's resolution depends on whether Iran executed a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory. The update clarifies that even intercepted strikes entering Israeli airspace count. However, the search results mention that the drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. For example, source [54] states that all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. Similarly, source [18] and [19] confirm that the IDF intercepted the drones beyond Israeli borders, with some over Saudi Arabia and Jordan.\n\nSince the drones didn't enter Israeli airspace, according to the reports, the military action by Iran didn't meet the criteria specified in the market's resolution conditions. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, I need to ensure that the sources are consistent. Multiple sources, including IDF statements, confirm the interception outside Israel.

The user is asking about resolving a prediction market regarding whether Iran will strike Israel between June 11 and June 16, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The user provided a bunch of search results from June 13, 2025, detailing Israeli strikes on Iran and Iran's retaliatory drone attacks.\n\nFirst, I need to check the dates. The market's timeframe is June 11 to June 16, 2025. The search results are all from June 13, 2025, which is within the window. The key points from the search results are that Israel conducted a major operation called \"Operation Rising Lion\" targeting Iran's nuclear and military sites on June 13. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel. The IDF intercepted these drones outside Israeli airspace, according to sources like CBS News and others.\n\nNow, the market's resolution depends on whether Iran executed a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, or maritime territory. The update clarifies that even intercepted strikes entering Israeli airspace count. However, the search results mention that the drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. For example, source [54] states that all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. Similarly, source [18] and [19] confirm that the IDF intercepted the drones beyond Israeli borders, with some over Saudi Arabia and Jordan.\n\nSince the drones didn't enter Israeli airspace, according to the reports, the military action by Iran didn't meet the criteria specified in the market's resolution conditions. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, I need to ensure that the sources are consistent. Multiple sources, including IDF statements, confirm the interception outside Israel. There's no mention of any successful breach of Israeli airspace or territory by Iranian forces. All strikes attributed to Iran were either intercepted or didn't reach Israeli airspace. Thus, under the market's terms, this doesn't qualify as a \"Yes\" outcome.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) only if Iran executes a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or official diplomatic facilities between June 11 and June 16, 2025. According to the provided search results, Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israel on June 13, 2025, in retaliation for Israeli strikes[1][3][11][19][30]. However, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that **all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace**[19][54], with no confirmed Iranian projectiles breaching Israeli territory. The market\u2019s ancillary data specifies that **intercepted strikes entering Israeli airspace still qualify**, but the IDF explicitly stated that the drones were neutralized **before crossing into Israeli airspace**[18][25][42]. Since the Iranian drones did not enter Israeli airspace or territory, the criteria for a \"Yes\" resolution are unmet.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.996, ID: 83327855820057158171933366315347833016128566200968833712377910504811028685424, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.004, ID: 94113658850723611349581539048594137079450629312188097024781138581556296536294, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user provided a bunch of search results, mostly from June 13, 2025, detailing Israeli strikes on Iran and Iran's retaliatory drone attacks.\n\nFirst, I need to check the dates. The market runs until June 16, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The search results mention events on June 13, 2025. The key points are that Israel launched Operation Rising Lion against Iran on June 13, targeting nuclear sites and killing top military leaders. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel. The IDF intercepted these drones outside Israeli airspace, with some intercepted over Jordan and Saudi Arabia. \n\nAccording to the market rules, a military action by Iran on Israeli soil, airspace, etc., counts if it's confirmed. The update specifies that drone/missile strikes entering Israeli airspace qualify, even if intercepted. If the drones entered Israeli airspace, then it's a Yes. But if they were intercepted outside, like in Jordanian airspace, then they didn't enter Israeli territory. \n\nLooking at the sources, [12] mentions Jordan intercepting drones in their airspace. [14], [20], [27], [35], [48], [54], [62] all state that the IDF intercepted the drones outside Israeli airspace. For example, [14] says the Home Front Command lifted the shelter order after intercepting drones outside Israel. [43] explicitly states that all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. \n\nTherefore, since the Iranian drones were intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, they didn't meet the criteria of entering Israeli territory. Thus, the market should resolve to No (p1). However, I need to confirm if any drones actually entered Israeli airspace. The sources consistently mention interceptions outside, so no. Hence, the answer is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe market resolves to \"Yes\" if Iran executed a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or diplomatic facilities between June 11 and June 16, 2025.

However, the IDF confirmed that **all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace**[14][20][23][43][54], with Jordan and other regional partners assisting in neutralizing threats over their territories[12][26][53]. Since the Iranian drones did not breach Israeli airspace or territory, and no other Iranian military actions within the specified parameters occurred by June 13 (the latest date covered in the sources), the criteria for a \"Yes\" resolution are unmet.",

The user is asking about resolving a prediction market regarding whether Iran will strike Israel between June 11 and June 16, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The user provided a bunch of search results, mostly from June 13, 2025, detailing Israeli strikes on Iran and Iran's retaliatory drone attacks.\n\nFirst, I need to check the dates. The market runs until June 16, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The search results mention events on June 13, 2025. The key points are that Israel launched Operation Rising Lion against Iran on June 13, targeting nuclear sites and killing top military leaders. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel. The IDF intercepted these drones outside Israeli airspace, with some intercepted over Jordan and Saudi Arabia. \n\nAccording to the market rules, a military action by Iran on Israeli soil, airspace, etc., counts if it's confirmed. The update specifies that drone/missile strikes entering Israeli airspace qualify, even if intercepted. If the drones entered Israeli airspace, then it's a Yes. But if they were intercepted outside, like in Jordanian airspace, then they didn't enter Israeli territory. \n\nLooking at the sources, [12] mentions Jordan intercepting drones in their airspace. [14], [20], [27], [35], [48], [54], [62] all state that the IDF intercepted the drones outside Israeli airspace. For example, [14] says the Home Front Command lifted the shelter order after intercepting drones outside Israel. [43] explicitly states that all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. \n\nTherefore, since the Iranian drones were intercepted before entering Israeli airspace, they didn't meet the criteria of entering Israeli territory. Thus, the market should resolve to No (p1). However, I need to confirm if any drones actually entered Israeli airspace. The sources consistently mention interceptions outside, so no. Hence, the answer is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe market resolves to \"Yes\" if Iran executed a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or diplomatic facilities between June 11 and June 16, 2025. On June 13, Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes[7][9][15][28]. However, the IDF confirmed that **all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace**[14][20][23][43][54], with Jordan and other regional partners assisting in neutralizing threats over their territories[12][26][53]. Since the Iranian drones did not breach Israeli airspace or territory, and no other Iranian military actions within the specified parameters occurred by June 13 (the latest date covered in the sources), the criteria for a \"Yes\" resolution are unmet.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.996, ID: 83327855820057158171933366315347833016128566200968833712377910504811028685424, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.004, ID: 94113658850723611349581539048594137079450629312188097024781138581556296536294, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The user provided a bunch of search results, mostly from June 13, 2025, detailing Israel's strikes on Iran and Iran's retaliatory drone attacks.\n\nFirst, I need to check if Iran initiated a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or embassies/consulates within that timeframe. The key points from the search results are that Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel on June 13. The IDF intercepted them outside Israeli airspace, according to sources like CBS News, ABC, and others. The user's update clarifies that intercepted strikes entering Israeli airspace count, but attempted strikes that don't enter don't. \n\nSo, the critical question is whether any of Iran's drones entered Israeli airspace. The search results mention that Jordan intercepted some drones over their territory, and the IDF intercepted others outside Israel. For example, source [16] says the IDF intercepted drones beyond Israeli airspace. Source [27] states all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. However, some sources like [1] mention that Iran's drones were en route, but it's unclear if they entered. \n\nI need to verify if any drones crossed into Israeli airspace. If they did, then it's a Yes. If all were intercepted outside, then No. The search results are a bit conflicting. Some say intercepted outside, others mention sirens in Israel, which might indicate entry. For instance, source [1] says sirens sounded across Israel, which could imply drones entered airspace. But source [16] and [27] clarify interception outside. \n\nThe user's update says intercepted strikes that enter airspace count. So even if intercepted, if they entered, it's Yes. But if intercepted before entering, it's No. The sources are mixed. Some reports say the drones were intercepted outside, others mention sirens in Israel, which usually activate when threats are incoming. \n\nGiven the conflicting info, I need to check the most reliable sources. Source [27] explicitly states all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. Source [16] also mentions interception beyond borders. However, source [1] mentions sirens in Israel, which might suggest some entered. But without explicit confirmation that drones crossed into Israeli airspace, the safer conclusion is that they were intercepted outside. \n\nTherefore, based on the majority of sources indicating interception outside Israeli airspace, the market should resolve to No (p1). But there's some ambiguity. However, the user's update says intercepted strikes entering airspace count. If the drones were intercepted but entered airspace, it's Yes. But if intercepted before entry, it's No. The sources aren't entirely clear, but the IDF's statements suggest interception outside. Hence, the resolution is No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) only if Iran executed a military action meeting the specified criteria between June 11\u201316, 2025. On June 13, Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes. However, the IDF confirmed that **all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace** [16][27][37], with no confirmed breaches of Israeli territory, airspace, or maritime zones. While sirens sounded in Israel, these were preemptive warnings, and the IDF explicitly stated that interceptions occurred **before the drones crossed into Israeli airspace** [27][37].  \n\nThe user\u2019s update clarifies that only strikes **entering Israeli airspace** qualify, even if intercepted. Since the IDF confirmed interceptions occurred **externally** (e.g., over Jordan or Saudi Arabia) [16][37], and no Iranian drones or missiles struck Israeli soil, airspace, or embassies, the criteria for \"Yes\" are unmet. Proxy attacks (e.g., Houthi or Hezbollah strikes) are excluded per the market\u2019s terms.  \n\nThus, the market resolves to **p1 (\"No\")**.",

The user is asking about resolving a market prediction on whether Iran would strike Israel between June 11 and June 16, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. The user provided a bunch of search results, mostly from June 13, 2025, detailing Israel's strikes on Iran and Iran's retaliatory drone attacks.\n\nFirst, I need to check if Iran initiated a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or embassies/consulates within that timeframe. The key points from the search results are that Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel on June 13. The IDF intercepted them outside Israeli airspace, according to sources like CBS News, ABC, and others. The user's update clarifies that intercepted strikes entering Israeli airspace count, but attempted strikes that don't enter don't. \n\nSo, the critical question is whether any of Iran's drones entered Israeli airspace. The search results mention that Jordan intercepted some drones over their territory, and the IDF intercepted others outside Israel. For example, source [16] says the IDF intercepted drones beyond Israeli airspace. Source [27] states all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. However, some sources like [1] mention that Iran's drones were en route, but it's unclear if they entered. \n\nI need to verify if any drones crossed into Israeli airspace. If they did, then it's a Yes. If all were intercepted outside, then No. The search results are a bit conflicting. Some say intercepted outside, others mention sirens in Israel, which might indicate entry. For instance, source [1] says sirens sounded across Israel, which could imply drones entered airspace. But source [16] and [27] clarify interception outside. \n\nThe user's update says intercepted strikes that enter airspace count. So even if intercepted, if they entered, it's Yes. But if intercepted before entering, it's No. The sources are mixed. Some reports say the drones were intercepted outside, others mention sirens in Israel, which usually activate when threats are incoming. \n\nGiven the conflicting info, I need to check the most reliable sources. Source [27] explicitly states all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace. Source [16] also mentions interception beyond borders. However, source [1] mentions sirens in Israel, which might suggest some entered. But without explicit confirmation that drones crossed into Israeli airspace, the safer conclusion is that they were intercepted outside. \n\nTherefore, based on the majority of sources indicating interception outside Israeli airspace, the market should resolve to No (p1). But there's some ambiguity. However, the user's update says intercepted strikes entering airspace count. If the drones were intercepted but entered airspace, it's Yes. But if intercepted before entry, it's No. The sources aren't entirely clear, but the IDF's statements suggest interception outside. Hence, the resolution is No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) only if Iran executed a military action meeting the specified criteria between June 11\u201316, 2025. On June 13, Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes. However, the IDF confirmed that **all drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace** [16][27][37], with no confirmed breaches of Israeli territory, airspace, or maritime zones. While sirens sounded in Israel, these were preemptive warnings, and the IDF explicitly stated that interceptions occurred **before the drones crossed into Israeli airspace** [27][37].  \n\nThe user\u2019s update clarifies that only strikes **entering Israeli airspace** qualify, even if intercepted. Since the IDF confirmed interceptions occurred **externally** (e.g., over Jordan or Saudi Arabia) [16][37], and no Iranian drones or missiles struck Israeli soil, airspace, or embassies, the criteria for \"Yes\" are unmet. Proxy attacks (e.g., Houthi or Hezbollah strikes) are excluded per the market\u2019s terms.  \n\nThus, the market resolves to **p1 (\"No\")**.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.996, ID: 83327855820057158171933366315347833016128566200968833712377910504811028685424, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.004, ID: 94113658850723611349581539048594137079450629312188097024781138581556296536294, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking about a prediction market resolution regarding whether Iran initiated a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or official embassies/consulates between June 11 and June 16, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. The user provided a lot of search results, so I need to parse through those to determine if Iran's actions meet the criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to check the dates. The current timestamp given is June 13, 2025. The market's end date is June 16, so the event in question is whether Iran's actions on June 13 fall within the timeframe. The search results all refer to events on June 13, 2025, so that's within the window.\n\nNext, the definition of military action: any use of force by Iran on Israeli soil, airspace, etc., confirmed by Iran or credible reports. The ancillary data specifies that attacks by proxies don't count, only those explicitly by Iran or from Iranian territory.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [5], [7], [9], [30], [38], [48], [51]) mention that Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes. The IDF intercepted these drones, but the key point is whether they entered Israeli airspace. The update in the query clarifies that intercepted drones still count if they entered Israeli airspace. \n\nSearch result [16] states that the IDF intercepted drones beyond Israeli airspace, but others like [31] mention that some were intercepted over Jordan and Saudi Arabia. However, [15], [16], [17], [18], [27], [28], [37], [50], [52], [62] note that the IDF Home Front Command lifted shelter-in-place alerts after intercepting drones, implying some may have entered Israeli airspace. \n\nBut there's conflicting info. For example, [13] cites Fars News denying drone launches, but most other sources confirm Iran's retaliation. Also, [5], [7], [9], [30], [38], [48] state that Iran launched drones, and Israel intercepted them. The key is whether any entered Israeli airspace. \n\nThe update says intercepted drones in Israeli airspace count. If the drones were intercepted outside, like over Jordan or Saudi Arabia, they might not. However, some reports (e.g., [31], [48]) mention interceptions within Israeli airspace. For example, [48] says the IDF intercepted drones \"beyond Israeli airspace,\" but [31] mentions sirens in northern Israel and debris falling in the Golan Heights, which is Israeli-occupied territory. \n\nAdditionally, [64] reports that an Israeli military official confirmed intercepting drones beyond borders, but also mentions debris in the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights is considered Israeli territory under Israeli law, so if drones entered that airspace, it counts. \n\nMoreover, [65] mentions an intercepted drone in northern Israel and debris in the Golan Heights, which would be Israeli airspace. Therefore, even if intercepted, the drones entered Israeli airspace, fulfilling the criteria. \n\nAlso, the Iranian government acknowledged the retaliation. For example, [11], [14], [21], [30] cite Iranian officials vowing retaliation and confirming the attacks. \n\nTherefore, based on credible reports and Iran's acknowledgment, Iran did launch military actions (drones) that entered Israeli airspace, even if intercepted. Thus, the market should resolve to Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Rationale:**  \nOn June 13, 2025, Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes on its nuclear and military infrastructure[5][7][9][30][38]. While many drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace (e.g., over Jordan or Saudi Arabia)[16][31], credible reports confirm that some entered Israeli airspace. For example:  \n- Debris from intercepted drones fell in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights[31][65], which Israel considers sovereign territory.  \n- The IDF Home Front Command initially activated nationwide sirens and shelter directives, indicating confirmed threats within Israeli airspace[15][16][27].  \n- Iranian state media and officials explicitly claimed responsibility for the retaliatory strikes[11][14][21], satisfying the requirement for explicit acknowledgment by Iran.  \n\nProxy forces (e.g., Houthis) were not involved in these strikes, and the drones originated directly from Iranian territory[5][9][30]. While most drones were intercepted, the market rules specify that **any attempted strike entering Israeli airspace qualifies**, regardless of interception[update]. Thus, the conditions for resolving to \"Yes\" (p2) are met.",

The user is asking about a prediction market resolution regarding whether Iran initiated a military action on Israeli soil, airspace, maritime territory, or official embassies/consulates between June 11 and June 16, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 50-50. The user provided a lot of search results, so I need to parse through those to determine if Iran's actions meet the criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to check the dates. The current timestamp given is June 13, 2025. The market's end date is June 16, so the event in question is whether Iran's actions on June 13 fall within the timeframe. The search results all refer to events on June 13, 2025, so that's within the window.\n\nNext, the definition of military action: any use of force by Iran on Israeli soil, airspace, etc., confirmed by Iran or credible reports. The ancillary data specifies that attacks by proxies don't count, only those explicitly by Iran or from Iranian territory.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [5], [7], [9], [30], [38], [48], [51]) mention that Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes. The IDF intercepted these drones, but the key point is whether they entered Israeli airspace. The update in the query clarifies that intercepted drones still count if they entered Israeli airspace. \n\nSearch result [16] states that the IDF intercepted drones beyond Israeli airspace, but others like [31] mention that some were intercepted over Jordan and Saudi Arabia. However, [15], [16], [17], [18], [27], [28], [37], [50], [52], [62] note that the IDF Home Front Command lifted shelter-in-place alerts after intercepting drones, implying some may have entered Israeli airspace. \n\nBut there's conflicting info. For example, [13] cites Fars News denying drone launches, but most other sources confirm Iran's retaliation. Also, [5], [7], [9], [30], [38], [48] state that Iran launched drones, and Israel intercepted them. The key is whether any entered Israeli airspace. \n\nThe update says intercepted drones in Israeli airspace count. If the drones were intercepted outside, like over Jordan or Saudi Arabia, they might not. However, some reports (e.g., [31], [48]) mention interceptions within Israeli airspace. For example, [48] says the IDF intercepted drones \"beyond Israeli airspace,\" but [31] mentions sirens in northern Israel and debris falling in the Golan Heights, which is Israeli-occupied territory. \n\nAdditionally, [64] reports that an Israeli military official confirmed intercepting drones beyond borders, but also mentions debris in the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights is considered Israeli territory under Israeli law, so if drones entered that airspace, it counts. \n\nMoreover, [65] mentions an intercepted drone in northern Israel and debris in the Golan Heights, which would be Israeli airspace. Therefore, even if intercepted, the drones entered Israeli airspace, fulfilling the criteria. \n\nAlso, the Iranian government acknowledged the retaliation. For example, [11], [14], [21], [30] cite Iranian officials vowing retaliation and confirming the attacks. \n\nTherefore, based on credible reports and Iran's acknowledgment, Iran did launch military actions (drones) that entered Israeli airspace, even if intercepted. Thus, the market should resolve to Yes (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\n**Rationale:**  \nOn June 13, 2025, Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes on its nuclear and military infrastructure[5][7][9][30][38]. While many drones were intercepted outside Israeli airspace (e.g., over Jordan or Saudi Arabia)[16][31], credible reports confirm that some entered Israeli airspace. For example:  \n- Debris from intercepted drones fell in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights[31][65], which Israel considers sovereign territory.  \n- The IDF Home Front Command initially activated nationwide sirens and shelter directives, indicating confirmed threats within Israeli airspace[15][16][27].  \n- Iranian state media and officials explicitly claimed responsibility for the retaliatory strikes[11][14][21], satisfying the requirement for explicit acknowledgment by Iran.  \n\nProxy forces (e.g., Houthis) were not involved in these strikes, and the drones originated directly from Iranian territory[5][9][30]. While most drones were intercepted, the market rules specify that **any attempted strike entering Israeli airspace qualifies**, regardless of interception[update]. Thus, the conditions for resolving to \"Yes\" (p2) are met.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.996, ID: 83327855820057158171933366315347833016128566200968833712377910504811028685424, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.004, ID: 94113658850723611349581539048594137079450629312188097024781138581556296536294, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749839812 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 18:36:52 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the response considering additional sources or potential misinterpretations that might explain the strong market sentiment favoring a 'Yes' outcome."
