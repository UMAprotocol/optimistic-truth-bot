      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know the outcome of the match between Liquid and Lynn Vision in the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, specifically round 1 on June 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Liquid\" if they win, \"Lynn Vision\" if they win, and 50-50 if it's a tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The user provided the current Unix timestamp as 1749755157, which converts to June 12, 2025, 19:05:57 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 2:45 PM ET. Since the current time is 7:05 PM UTC, which is 2:05 PM ET, the match is in the future relative to the current timestamp. Wait, no\u2014June 12, 2025, 2:45 PM ET is 18:45 UTC. The current time is 19:05 UTC, so the match is actually in the past. Wait, no, the user's current date is June 12, 2025, 7:07 PM UTC. The match is at 2:45 PM ET, which is 18:45 UTC. So the current time is 19:05 UTC, which is after the match time. Therefore, the match has already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify the result from the provided search results. Looking at the search results, result [9] from dust2.us states that Lynn Vision destroyed Liquid in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage Three debut on June 12, 2025. The score was 5:13 in a best-of-1 series. Additionally, result [7] from egamersworld.com confirms that Liquid lost with a score of 5:13. Result [10] from dust2.us also lists the match as a loss for Liquid. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Lynn Vision\" if they win. Since the match has already occurred and Lynn Vision won, the resolution should be p1. However, I need to ensure that the match in question is indeed the round 1 match on June 12. The search results mention Stage Three, but the user's query refers to round 1. Wait, looking at the search results, result [13] from Liquipedia's Stage 3 page shows that Stage 3 started on June 12, 2025, with Round 1 matches. The match between Liquid and Lynn Vision is part of Stage 3, Round 1. The user's ancillary data refers to round 1 of the tournament, which aligns with Stage 3 Round 1. \n\nTherefore, the match in question is indeed the one that occurred on June 12, 2025, where Lynn Vision won. The resolution should be p1. However, I need to confirm that there's no conflicting information. All relevant search results ([7], [9], [10]) indicate a Lynn Vision victory. There's no mention of a tie, cancellation, or delay. Thus, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\n# BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025: Liquid vs. Lynn Vision Round 1 Resolution  \n\n**Summary**  \nLynn Vision secured a decisive victory over Team Liquid in their BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 Stage 3 Round 1 match on June 12, 2025, winning 13-5 on Dust2.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: BLAST.tv Austin Major: Liquid vs. Lynn Vision, description: Liquid and Lynn Vision are scheduled to play each other in round 1 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major Tournament on June 12, 2025, at 2:45\u00e2\u0080\u00afPM\u00e2\u0080\u00afET.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Liquid\" if Liquid win against Lynn Vision in round 1 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major Tournament.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Lynn Vision\" if Lynn Vision win against Liquid in round 1 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major Tournament.\n\nIf the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025, this market will resolve to 50\u00e2\u0080\u009150.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be official information from the HLTV (https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025) market_id: 551697\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Lynn Vision, p2 to Liquid, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749755157 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-12 19:05:57 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know the outcome of the match between Liquid and Lynn Vision in the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, specifically round 1 on June 12, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Liquid\" if they win, \"Lynn Vision\" if they win, and 50-50 if it's a tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date. The user provided the current Unix timestamp as 1749755157, which converts to June 12, 2025, 19:05:57 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 12, 2025, at 2:45 PM ET. Since the current time is 7:05 PM UTC, which is 2:05 PM ET, the match is in the future relative to the current timestamp. Wait, no\u2014June 12, 2025, 2:45 PM ET is 18:45 UTC. The current time is 19:05 UTC, so the match is actually in the past. Wait, no, the user's current date is June 12, 2025, 7:07 PM UTC. The match is at 2:45 PM ET, which is 18:45 UTC. So the current time is 19:05 UTC, which is after the match time. Therefore, the match has already occurred.\n\nNext, I need to verify the result from the provided search results. Looking at the search results, result [9] from dust2.us states that Lynn Vision destroyed Liquid in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage Three debut on June 12, 2025. The score was 5:13 in a best-of-1 series. Additionally, result [7] from egamersworld.com confirms that Liquid lost with a score of 5:13. Result [10] from dust2.us also lists the match as a loss for Liquid. \n\nThe user's ancillary data specifies that the market resolves to \"Lynn Vision\" if they win. Since the match has already occurred and Lynn Vision won, the resolution should be p1. However, I need to ensure that the match in question is indeed the round 1 match on June 12. The search results mention Stage Three, but the user's query refers to round 1. Wait, looking at the search results, result [13] from Liquipedia's Stage 3 page shows that Stage 3 started on June 12, 2025, with Round 1 matches. The match between Liquid and Lynn Vision is part of Stage 3, Round 1. The user's ancillary data refers to round 1 of the tournament, which aligns with Stage 3 Round 1. \n\nTherefore, the match in question is indeed the one that occurred on June 12, 2025, where Lynn Vision won. The resolution should be p1. However, I need to confirm that there's no conflicting information. All relevant search results ([7], [9], [10]) indicate a Lynn Vision victory. There's no mention of a tie, cancellation, or delay. Thus, the correct resolution is p1.\n</think>\n\n# BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025: Liquid vs. Lynn Vision Round 1 Resolution  \n\n**Summary**  \nLynn Vision secured a decisive victory over Team Liquid in their BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 Stage 3 Round 1 match on June 12, 2025, winning 13-5 on Dust2.

This outcome aligns with the ancillary data\u2019s **p1** resolution condition.  \n\n**Recommendation**: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Liquid, Price: 0.11, ID: 62094385493285755982710410771181227549944379693640333619602697327963905126002, Winner: No\n- Token: Lynn Vision, Price: 0.89, ID: 42816009183134771552489461367012416911821757336702314231766429519684859164246, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Lynn Vision, p2 to Liquid, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Lynn Vision, p2 = Liquid\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Lynn Vision outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.890 = 89.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
