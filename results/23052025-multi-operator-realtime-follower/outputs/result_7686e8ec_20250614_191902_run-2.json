Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 2 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551821\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749928439 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 19:13:59 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_btc_price_change(date_str, hour=14, minute=0, timezone_str=\"US/Eastern\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the BTC/USDT pair on Binance for the specified 1-hour candle.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format (default: 14 for 2 PM ET)\n        minute: Minute (default: 0)\n        timezone_str: Timezone string (default: \"US/Eastern\")\n\n    Returns:\n        Percentage change as float or None if data cannot be retrieved.\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching BTC/USDT price change for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(\n            datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n        \n        logger.debug(f\"Converted local time to UTC timestamp: {start_time_ms}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error converting time: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # plus 1 hour\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            price_change_percent = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved price change: {price_change_percent}%\")\n            return price_change_percent\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n    \n    return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the BTC/USDT price went up or down on June 14, 2025, at 2 PM ET.\n    \"\"\"\n    date_str = \"2025-06-14\"\n    hour = 14  # 2 PM ET\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    price_change_percent = get_btc_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n\n    if price_change_percent is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if data cannot be retrieved\n    elif price_change_percent >= 0:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9805, ID: 66414727521768370704213125420994624017407391063366366528987568847080789929266, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0195, ID: 14691978675924492844135295263671631467250765750222811506071790672146085243388, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

I need you to generate code to solve the following prediction market question:\n\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 2 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551821\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551821\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749928439 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 19:13:59 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_btc_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the percentage change for the BTC/USDT pair on Binance for the specified 1-hour candle.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format\n        minute: Minute\n        timezone_str: Timezone string\n\n    Returns:\n        Percentage change as float or None if data cannot be retrieved.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n        time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n        target_time_local = tz.localize(datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n        target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n        start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000) - 3600000  # 1 hour in milliseconds\n\n        api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n        params = {\n            \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n            \"interval\": \"1h\",\n            \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n            \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000\n        }\n\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n\n        if data and len(data) > 0:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            percentage_change = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n            return percentage_change\n        else:\n            return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch BTC price data: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the BTC/USDT price went up or down at the specified time.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Specific date and time for the query\n    date_str = \"2025-06-14\"\n    hour = 14  # 2 PM\n    minute = 0\n    timezone_str = \"US/Eastern\"\n\n    price_change = get_btc_price_change(date_str, hour, minute, timezone_str)\n\n    if price_change is None:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if data cannot be retrieved\n    elif price_change >= 0:\n        print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4.

      "prompt": null,
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT pair on Binance had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0 for the 1-hour candle starting at June 14, 2 PM ET. The current timestamp is June 14, 2025, 19:13:59 UTC. \n\nFirst, I need to convert 2 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 2 PM ET is 18:00 UTC. The 1-hour candle in question would be from 18:00 to 19:00 UTC. Since the current time is 19:13 UTC, the candle has closed, and the data should be available.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources provide historical data. The Central Charts data [4] shows the 5-day quotes with the latest data on June 8, 2025, which is too old. CoinGecko's historical data [6] includes June 14, 2025, with a close price of $106,046, but the 1-hour change isn't specified. TradingView's data [7][9] indicates the current price is $104,564.19, down 0.44% in 24 hours, but again, the specific 1-hour window isn't clear.\n\nThe key source is Binance's own data. The Binance spot page [26][46] shows real-time data, but the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour window. However, the Cryptrata dataset [3][47] mentions tick-by-tick data until yesterday, which might not cover the specific hour. The Kaggle datasets [1][11][27][39][50] provide historical data up to the present, automatically updated, which should include the required 1-hour candle.\n\nGiven that the current time is past the candle's close, the data should be available. The resolution depends on Binance's displayed change for that 1H candle. If the change is \u22650%, it's Up (p2); else, Down (p1). Since the user's timestamp is after the candle close, and assuming the data confirms the change, but without explicit data points in the provided context, I might have to infer. However, the user's personalization instructs to resolve based on the most probable outcome if data is missing. \n\nWait, the current time is 19:13 UTC, which is after the 18:00-19:00 candle. The Binance data should have the 1H change. The TradingView ideas [10][21] mention recent price movements, but not the exact window. The Central Charts [4] 5-day data shows the latest on June 8, which isn't helpful. The Coinalyze news [14][61] from June 14 mentions Bitcoin's price around $104,000-$105,000, but not the specific hour.\n\nSince the exact 1H change isn't directly provided in the search results, but the user's instructions say to use the specified URL (Binance BTC/USDT page) and current data, and given that the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, I should check if the 1H candle's change is available. If not, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the user provided search results up to June 14, 2025. The CoinGecko data [6] for June 14 shows a close price of $106,046, but that's daily. The 1H candle from 18:00-19:00 UTC would need the open and close prices for that hour. If the close is higher than the open, it's Up. \n\nLooking at the Binance Futures page [29][51], the mark price is 104,974.3, but that's for perpetual contracts. The spot price on Binance [26][46] is 104,875.18, but without the specific 1H data. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit 1H data in the provided context, but the instruction to resolve based on Binance's data, and the current time being after the event, I might have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data defines p2 as Up if change \u22650. \n\nAssuming that the 1H candle closed with a non-negative change, but without concrete data, it's ambiguous. However, considering the market's description and the provided data up to June 14, if the price at 19:00 UTC was higher than at 18:00, it's Up. The latest price in the data is around $104k, but without the exact hourly open/close, it's uncertain. \n\nWait, the user's current time is 19:13 UTC, which is after the candle close. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, and the change value for the 1H candle. The search results include the Binance page [26][46], but the provided data doesn't show the 1H change. However, the Kaggle datasets [1][11][27][39][50] are updated daily and include 1-hour data. If those datasets have the 18:00-19:00 UTC candle, and the close is higher than open, then p2. Otherwise, p1. \n\nSince the datasets are not explicitly showing the exact hour, but the event is in the past, and assuming the data is available, but not present in the context, the assistant should resolve based on the most probable outcome. If the price was fluctuating around $105k, and the 1H change is positive, then p2. However, without explicit data, it's safer to recommend p4. But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering the ancillary data's resolution conditions, and the lack of explicit data in the provided context, the assistant should check if any of the search results mention the specific 1H change. The TradingView ideas [10] from June 14 mention a price of $104,564.19, down 0.44% in 24h, but that's not the 1H window. The 1H candle's change isn't directly provided. \n\nTherefore, without explicit data, but the event date being in the past, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. If the market's title is \"Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 2 PM ET\", and the current time is after that, but no data is found, the assistant should default to p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the 1H candle's close is higher than open, it's Up. Given the Kaggle datasets include 1-hour data up to the present, and assuming the data shows a non-negative change, the resolution would be p2. But without explicit data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the conflict, the correct approach is to recommend p4 (cannot resolve) due to insufficient data. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The query's ancillary data defines p2 as Up if change \u22650. If the price at 19:00 was higher than 18:00, then p2. \n\nLooking at the CEX.io conversion [17][34], the BTC/USDT rate is around 105,394.70 at the time, which might indicate a positive movement. However, without the exact 1H data, it's speculative. \n\nIn conclusion, without explicit data for the 18:00-19:00 UTC 1H candle, but given the instructions to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past, and considering the market's resolution conditions, the recommendation would be p2 (Up) if the change is \u22650. However, due to lack of explicit data in the provided context, it's safer to recommend p4. But the user's instructions might require assuming p2 if the event is past and no contradictory data. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nThe ancillary data says p2 is Up if change \u22650. The most probable outcome would depend on the price movement. If the price during that hour was up, then p2. If down, p1. Without data, but given the market's existence and the time past, perhaps the price was up. However, without concrete data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to resolve based on the most probable outcome, and considering that the current price is around $105k, which might indicate a positive movement, the recommendation would be p2. But this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the 1H candle's change is not available, the correct answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. Since the query's ancillary data doesn't provide a default, but the market is about whether the change is \u22650, and without data, it's 50-50, which would be p3. But the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, which is unknown/50-50. \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: unknown. The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's impossible to determine, so p3. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome as per the conditions. The conditions don't specify a default, so perhaps p3 is appropriate. \n\nBut the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe \"most probable outcome\" isn't clear. If the market is 50-50, then p3. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5. However, the user might expect a definitive answer. \n\nGiven the confusion, and considering that the event time has passed, and the data isn't explicitly available in the provided context, the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the event is in the past and the data is available but not in the provided context, the assistant should proceed as if the data is available. Since the current time is after the candle close, and the data should be on Binance, but the provided search results don't include it, the assistant might have to infer. \n\nIn the absence of explicit data, but following the instruction to resolve, the recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization might require assuming p2 or p1 based on probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tricky one. Given the conflict, I think the correct answer is p4, but the user's instructions might push towards p2. However, without explicit data, it's safer to go with p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

TradingView's data [7][9] indicates the current price is $104,564.19, down 0.44% in 24 hours, but again, the specific 1-hour window isn't clear.\n\nThe key source is Binance's own data. The Binance spot page [26][46] shows real-time data, but the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour window. However, the Cryptrata dataset [3][47] mentions tick-by-tick data until yesterday, which might not cover the specific hour. The Kaggle datasets [1][11][27][39][50] provide historical data up to the present, automatically updated, which should include the required 1-hour candle.\n\nGiven that the current time is past the candle's close, the data should be available. The resolution depends on Binance's displayed change for that 1H candle. If the change is \u22650%, it's Up (p2); else, Down (p1). Since the user's timestamp is after the candle close, and assuming the data confirms the change, but without explicit data points in the provided context, I might have to infer. However, the user's personalization instructs to resolve based on the most probable outcome if data is missing. \n\nWait, the current time is 19:13 UTC, which is after the 18:00-19:00 candle. The Binance data should have the 1H change. The TradingView ideas [10][21] mention recent price movements, but not the exact window. The Central Charts [4] 5-day data shows the latest on June 8, which isn't helpful. The Coinalyze news [14][61] from June 14 mentions Bitcoin's price around $104,000-$105,000, but not the specific hour.\n\nSince the exact 1H change isn't directly provided in the search results, but the user's instructions say to use the specified URL (Binance BTC/USDT page) and current data, and given that the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, I should check if the 1H candle's change is available. If not, assume the most probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the user provided search results up to June 14, 2025. The CoinGecko data [6] for June 14 shows a close price of $106,046, but that's daily. The 1H candle from 18:00-19:00 UTC would need the open and close prices for that hour. If the close is higher than the open, it's Up. \n\nLooking at the Binance Futures page [29][51], the mark price is 104,974.3, but that's for perpetual contracts. The spot price on Binance [26][46] is 104,875.18, but without the specific 1H data. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit 1H data in the provided context, but the instruction to resolve based on Binance's data, and the current time being after the event, I might have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data defines p2 as Up if change \u22650. \n\nAssuming that the 1H candle closed with a non-negative change, but without concrete data, it's ambiguous. However, considering the market's description and the provided data up to June 14, if the price at 19:00 UTC was higher than at 18:00, it's Up. The latest price in the data is around $104k, but without the exact hourly open/close, it's uncertain. \n\nWait, the user's current time is 19:13 UTC, which is after the candle close. The resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, and the change value for the 1H candle. The search results include the Binance page [26][46], but the provided data doesn't show the 1H change. However, the Kaggle datasets [1][11][27][39][50] are updated daily and include 1-hour data. If those datasets have the 18:00-19:00 UTC candle, and the close is higher than open, then p2. Otherwise, p1. \n\nSince the datasets are not explicitly showing the exact hour, but the event is in the past, and assuming the data is available, but not present in the context, the assistant should resolve based on the most probable outcome. If the price was fluctuating around $105k, and the 1H change is positive, then p2. However, without explicit data, it's safer to recommend p4. But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering the ancillary data's resolution conditions, and the lack of explicit data in the provided context, the assistant should check if any of the search results mention the specific 1H change. The TradingView ideas [10] from June 14 mention a price of $104,564.19, down 0.44% in 24h, but that's not the 1H window. The 1H candle's change isn't directly provided. \n\nTherefore, without explicit data, but the event date being in the past, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. If the market's title is \"Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 2 PM ET\", and the current time is after that, but no data is found, the assistant should default to p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the 1H candle's close is higher than open, it's Up. Given the Kaggle datasets include 1-hour data up to the present, and assuming the data shows a non-negative change, the resolution would be p2. But without explicit data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the conflict, the correct approach is to recommend p4 (cannot resolve) due to insufficient data. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The query's ancillary data defines p2 as Up if change \u22650. If the price at 19:00 was higher than 18:00, then p2. \n\nLooking at the CEX.io conversion [17][34], the BTC/USDT rate is around 105,394.70 at the time, which might indicate a positive movement. However, without the exact 1H data, it's speculative. \n\nIn conclusion, without explicit data for the 18:00-19:00 UTC 1H candle, but given the instructions to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past, and considering the market's resolution conditions, the recommendation would be p2 (Up) if the change is \u22650. However, due to lack of explicit data in the provided context, it's safer to recommend p4. But the user's instructions might require assuming p2 if the event is past and no contradictory data. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nThe ancillary data says p2 is Up if change \u22650. The most probable outcome would depend on the price movement. If the price during that hour was up, then p2. If down, p1. Without data, but given the market's existence and the time past, perhaps the price was up. However, without concrete data, it's uncertain. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to resolve based on the most probable outcome, and considering that the current price is around $105k, which might indicate a positive movement, the recommendation would be p2. But this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the 1H candle's change is not available, the correct answer is p4. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. Since the query's ancillary data doesn't provide a default, but the market is about whether the change is \u22650, and without data, it's 50-50, which would be p3. But the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, which is unknown/50-50. \n\nWait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: unknown. The user's instruction says if no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without data, it's impossible to determine, so p3. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome as per the conditions. The conditions don't specify a default, so perhaps p3 is appropriate. \n\nBut the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe \"most probable outcome\" isn't clear. If the market is 50-50, then p3. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5. However, the user might expect a definitive answer. \n\nGiven the confusion, and considering that the event time has passed, and the data isn't explicitly available in the provided context, the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the event is in the past and the data is available but not in the provided context, the assistant should proceed as if the data is available. Since the current time is after the candle close, and the data should be on Binance, but the provided search results don't include it, the assistant might have to infer. \n\nIn the absence of explicit data, but following the instruction to resolve, the recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization might require assuming p2 or p1 based on probable outcome. \n\nThis is a tricky one. Given the conflict, I think the correct answer is p4, but the user's instructions might push towards p2. However, without explicit data, it's safer to go with p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9805, ID: 66414727521768370704213125420994624017407391063366366528987568847080789929266, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0195, ID: 14691978675924492844135295263671631467250765750222811506071790672146085243388, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the Bitcoin price (BTC/USDT) on Binance had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0 for the 1-hour candle starting at June 14, 2 PM ET. The resolution depends on the data from Binance's BTC/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle once it's finalized.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact time frame of the 1-hour candle. Since the event time is June 14, 2 PM ET, I should convert this to UTC because Binance uses UTC timestamps. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 2 PM ET would be 18:00 UTC (2 PM + 4 hours). The 1-hour candle starting at 18:00 UTC would close at 19:00 UTC. Therefore, the relevant candle is from 18:00 to 19:00 UTC on June 14, 2025.\n\nNext, I need to check the provided search results for any data points that include this specific time frame. Let's go through the relevant sources:\n\n1. **Search Result [2]**: TradingView's BTCUSDT Futures Contract (Jun 2025) shows the price on June 14, 2025, as 104,749.0 USDT, with a 24-hour change of -0.07%. However, this is for the futures contract, not the spot market, so it might not be the correct source.\n\n2. **Search Result [5]**: Cex.io's conversion rate on 6/14/2025 is 105,122.82630421747 USDT per BTC. This is a spot price but doesn't provide the hourly change.\n\n3. **Search Result [9]**: Binance's spot price for BTC/USDT is listed as 104,875.18, but again, no hourly change data.\n\n4. **Search Result [11]**: TradingView's BTC/USDT chart shows a price of 104,564.19 USDT with a 24-hour change of -0.44%, but this doesn't specify the 1-hour window.\n\n5. **Search Result [12]**: Binance Futures USD\u24c8-Margined Perpetual Chart for BTCUSDT shows a 24h High of 106,173.6 and Low of 104,069.5, but again, this is futures data, not spot.\n\n6. **Search Result [15]**: Binance's price prediction for June 14, 2025, is $105,114.30, but this is a forecast, not actual data.\n\n7. **Search Result [6]**: Crypto Rover's analysis on June 14, 2025, mentions a trading range between 65,000 and 68,000 USD, but this seems inconsistent with other data points showing prices above 100,000 USDT, possibly due to a different time frame or error.\n\n8. **Search Result [3]**: A YouTube video from June 14, 2025, mentions Bitcoin's price around $66,000, but this conflicts with other sources and might be outdated or incorrect.\n\nNotably, most sources either refer to futures data, provide spot prices without hourly changes, or have inconsistencies. The critical missing piece is the actual 1-hour candle data from Binance's API for the specified time. The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, so the correct approach is to use Binance's official data.\n\nHowever, the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour candle data for 18:00-19:00 UTC on June 14, 2025. Without this specific data, I can't definitively determine the percentage change. The user's previous attempt returned p4 (insufficient data), and they're asking to try again with alternative sources.\n\nGiven the absence of direct data, I might infer from the closest available information. For example, if the price at 18:00 UTC was 105,122.83 (from Cex.io) and at 19:00 UTC it was 104,875.18 (from Binance spot), the change would be negative. However, these are from different sources and time frames, so this is speculative.\n\nSince the user's instructions require relying strictly on Binance's data and the provided sources don't include the necessary 1H candle information, the correct resolution remains p4 (cannot be resolved due to insufficient data). The ancillary data allows assuming the most probable outcome if the event date is past, but without verified data, this isn't possible here.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749928439 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 19:13:59 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step.

This is a spot price but doesn't provide the hourly change.\n\n3. **Search Result [9]**: Binance's spot price for BTC/USDT is listed as 104,875.18, but again, no hourly change data.\n\n4. **Search Result [11]**: TradingView's BTC/USDT chart shows a price of 104,564.19 USDT with a 24-hour change of -0.44%, but this doesn't specify the 1-hour window.\n\n5. **Search Result [12]**: Binance Futures USD\u24c8-Margined Perpetual Chart for BTCUSDT shows a 24h High of 106,173.6 and Low of 104,069.5, but again, this is futures data, not spot.\n\n6. **Search Result [15]**: Binance's price prediction for June 14, 2025, is $105,114.30, but this is a forecast, not actual data.\n\n7. **Search Result [6]**: Crypto Rover's analysis on June 14, 2025, mentions a trading range between 65,000 and 68,000 USD, but this seems inconsistent with other data points showing prices above 100,000 USDT, possibly due to a different time frame or error.\n\n8. **Search Result [3]**: A YouTube video from June 14, 2025, mentions Bitcoin's price around $66,000, but this conflicts with other sources and might be outdated or incorrect.\n\nNotably, most sources either refer to futures data, provide spot prices without hourly changes, or have inconsistencies. The critical missing piece is the actual 1-hour candle data from Binance's API for the specified time. The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, so the correct approach is to use Binance's official data.\n\nHowever, the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour candle data for 18:00-19:00 UTC on June 14, 2025. Without this specific data, I can't definitively determine the percentage change. The user's previous attempt returned p4 (insufficient data), and they're asking to try again with alternative sources.\n\nGiven the absence of direct data, I might infer from the closest available information. For example, if the price at 18:00 UTC was 105,122.83 (from Cex.io) and at 19:00 UTC it was 104,875.18 (from Binance spot), the change would be negative. However, these are from different sources and time frames, so this is speculative.\n\nSince the user's instructions require relying strictly on Binance's data and the provided sources don't include the necessary 1H candle information, the correct resolution remains p4 (cannot be resolved due to insufficient data). The ancillary data allows assuming the most probable outcome if the event date is past, but without verified data, this isn't possible here.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9805, ID: 66414727521768370704213125420994624017407391063366366528987568847080789929266, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0195, ID: 14691978675924492844135295263671631467250765750222811506071790672146085243388, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.981 = 98.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 2 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551821\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

        "critique": "The response from the solver is thorough in its attempt to gather and analyze data relevant to the query. It correctly identifies the need for specific hourly data from Binance for the BTC/USDT pair and acknowledges the absence of this data, leading to a p4 recommendation. However, the response fails to align with the strong market sentiment which heavily favors an 'Up' outcome (p2). The market data shows a 98.1% confidence in an 'Up' outcome, which contradicts the solver's recommendation of p4 due to insufficient data. This discrepancy indicates a significant misalignment with market expectations and suggests a need for reevaluation of the available data or the methodology used by the solver.",
