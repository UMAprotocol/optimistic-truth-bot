Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Sunrisers Hyderabad vs. Kolkata Knight Riders, description: In the upcoming IPL game, scheduled for May 10 at 10:00AM ET:\nIf the Sunrisers Hyderabad win, the market will resolve to \"Sunrisers Hyderabad\".\nIf the Kolkata Knight Riders win, the market will resolve to \"Kolkata Knight Riders\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 to Sunrisers Hyderabad, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Sunrisers Hyderabad vs. Kolkata Knight Riders, description: In the upcoming IPL game, scheduled for May 10 at 10:00AM ET:\nIf the Sunrisers Hyderabad win, the market will resolve to \"Sunrisers Hyderabad\".\nIf the Kolkata Knight Riders win, the market will resolve to \"Kolkata Knight Riders\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 to Sunrisers Hyderabad, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748202394 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 19:46:34 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configuration for headers and endpoints\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\n# Function to make API requests\ndef make_request(endpoint, path):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(f\"{endpoint}/{path}\", headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Function to find the game and determine the outcome\ndef find_game_and_determine_outcome(date, team1, team2):\n    # Format the date for the API request\n    formatted_date = datetime.strptime(date, \"%Y-%m-%d\").strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    games = make_request(PRIMARY_ENDPOINT, f\"GamesByDate/{formatted_date}\")\n    if not games:\n        return \"p4\"  # Unable to retrieve data\n\n    # Search for the specific game\n    for game in games:\n        if {game['HomeTeam'], game['AwayTeam']} == {team1, team2}:\n            if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n                    return \"p1\" if game['HomeTeam'] == team1 else \"p2\"\n                elif game['HomeTeamRuns'] < game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n                    return \"p1\" if game['AwayTeam'] == team1 else \"p2\"\n            elif game['Status'] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                return \"p3\"\n            return \"p4\"  # Game not completed yet\n\n    return \"p4\"  # Game not found or no conclusive outcome\n\n# Main execution function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Define the game details\n    game_date = \"2025-05-10\"\n    team1 = \"Kolkata Knight Riders\"\n    team2 = \"Sunrisers Hyderabad\"\n\n    # Determine the outcome\n    result = find_game_and_determine_outcome(game_date, team1, team2)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {result}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-05-10\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Sunrisers Hyderabad vs. Kolkata Knight Riders, description: In the upcoming IPL game, scheduled for May 10 at 10:00AM ET:\nIf the Sunrisers Hyderabad win, the market will resolve to \"Sunrisers Hyderabad\".\nIf the Kolkata Knight Riders win, the market will resolve to \"Kolkata Knight Riders\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 to Sunrisers Hyderabad, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748202394 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 19:46:34 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configuration for headers and endpoints\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n\n# Function to make API requests\ndef make_request(endpoint, path):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(f\"{endpoint}/{path}\", headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        if endpoint == PROXY_ENDPOINT:\n            print(\"Proxy failed, trying primary endpoint\")\n            return make_request(PRIMARY_ENDPOINT, path)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Failed to retrieve data: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n# Function to find the game and determine the outcome\ndef resolve_market():\n    date_str = \"2025-05-10\"\n    teams = {\"Sunrisers Hyderabad\": \"p2\", \"Kolkata Knight Riders\": \"p1\"}\n    path = f\"GamesByDate/{date_str}\"\n\n    games = make_request(PROXY_ENDPOINT, path)\n    if games is None:\n        return \"recommendation: p4\"  # Unable to resolve due to data fetch failure\n\n    for game in games:\n        if game['HomeTeam'] in teams and game['AwayTeam'] in teams:\n            if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n                    return f\"recommendation: {teams[game['HomeTeam']]}\"\n                else:\n                    return f\"recommendation: {teams[game['AwayTeam']]}\"\n            elif game['Status'] == \"Canceled\":\n                return \"recommendation: p3\"\n            elif game['Status'] == \"Postponed\":\n                return \"recommendation: p4\"\n            else:\n                return \"recommendation: p4\"\n\n    return \"recommendation: p4\"  # No matching game found or game not yet played\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    result = resolve_market()\n    print(result)\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nProxy failed, trying primary endpoint\nFailed to retrieve data: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-05-10\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 to Sunrisers Hyderabad, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 = Sunrisers Hyderabad\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Sunrisers Hyderabad outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Sunrisers Hyderabad vs. Kolkata Knight Riders, description: In the upcoming IPL game, scheduled for May 10 at 10:00AM ET:\nIf the Sunrisers Hyderabad win, the market will resolve to \"Sunrisers Hyderabad\".\nIf the Kolkata Knight Riders win, the market will resolve to \"Kolkata Knight Riders\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 to Sunrisers Hyderabad, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748202394 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 19:46:34 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Where p1 corresponds to Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 to Sunrisers Hyderabad, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 = Sunrisers Hyderabad\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Sunrisers Hyderabad outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to resolve this UMA optimistic oracle request. The user is asking about the outcome of the IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) scheduled for May 10, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if SRH wins, it's p2; if KKR wins, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the match happened as scheduled. The user provided several search results. Let me go through them. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a result from May 9 (source [14]) where SRH announced ticket refunds because the IPL 2025 season was suspended due to military tensions between India and Pakistan. The match on May 10 was canceled. Another source [15] confirms that the SRH vs KKR clash on May 10 was scrapped, and tickets were refunded. \n\nThen, sources [16], [17], and [18] mention that the IPL was suspended but later resumed with a revised schedule starting from May 17. The original May 10 match wasn't played as planned. \n\nHowever, looking at the more recent search results (sources [1] to [13]), there's a match between SRH and KKR on May 25, 2025, which SRH won by 110 runs. This was Match 68 of the IPL 2025, held at Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the match scheduled for May 10. But the sources indicate that the May 10 match was canceled due to the suspension, and the teams played later on May 25 as part of the rescheduled matches. \n\nThe key point here is whether the May 25 match is considered the same event as the originally scheduled May 10 match. The ancillary data says if the game is postponed, the market remains open until completed. If canceled entirely with no make-up, resolve to p3. \n\nIn this case, the May 10 match was canceled, but a rescheduled match was played on May 25. However, the user's query specifically refers to the May 10 game. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are tied to that specific scheduled game. \n\nBut according to the sources, the May 10 game was canceled, not postponed. The BCCI suspended the IPL and later revised the schedule, which included a new match between SRH and KKR on May 25. This seems like a new fixture rather than a postponement of the original May 10 match. \n\nTherefore, the original May 10 match was canceled without being made up, and the May 25 match is a separate event. The resolution conditions state that if the game is canceled entirely with no make-up, it resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nHowever, the user might be conflating the two matches. But according to the instructions, I must ensure that the event resolved is the same as specified in the user prompt. The user's query is about the May 10 game, which was canceled. The May 25 match is a different fixture. \n\nTherefore, since the May 10 game was canceled and not made up, the market should resolve to p3 (50-50). However, I need to check if the rescheduled May 25 match is considered the make-up game. The sources mention that the revised schedule included remaining matches, but it's unclear if the May 25 match was a rescheduling of the May 10 game or part of the original fixture list. \n\nLooking at source [13], the May 25 match is referred to as Match 68, which might have been part of the original schedule. The original May 10 match might have been a different fixture (perhaps a home game for SRH), which was canceled and not rescheduled. The May 25 match was played at a neutral venue (Delhi), whereas the original May 10 match was supposed to be in Hyderabad (source [14], [15]). \n\nTherefore, the May 25 match is a different fixture, not a make-up of the canceled May 10 game. Hence, the May 10 game was canceled entirely without a make-up, leading to a resolution of p3. \n\nBut wait, the user's ancillary data says if the game is postponed, the market remains open until completed. If it's canceled with no make-up, resolve to 50-50. Since the May 10 game was canceled and not rescheduled, it should be p3. However, the teams did play later, but that's a different match. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p3. However, the user might have intended the May 25 match, but according to the strict terms, the query is about the May 10 game. \n\nBut looking at the user's personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, but the user prompt specifies the event was postponed or canceled, we need to check. The May 10 game was canceled, and the May 25 is a different match. \n\nThus, the resolution should be p3. However, the user might have updated the query to refer to the May 25 match, but the original query is about May 10. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is May 25, 2025, 19:46:34 UTC. The May 10 game was in the past, and it was canceled. The May 25 match is on the same day as the current timestamp, but the query is about the May 10 game. \n\nTherefore, the May 10 game was canceled, no make-up, so resolve to p3. But the user might have intended the May 25 match. However, the query explicitly states the May 10 game. \n\nBut looking at the search results, the May 25 match is between SRH and KKR, which SRH won. If the user's query is about the May 10 game, which was canceled, but the ancillary data's resolution is based on that specific game, then the answer is p3. However, if the user intended the rescheduled match on May 25, then it's p2. \n\nBut the user's query specifically mentions the May 10 game. Therefore, the resolution should be p3. However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But in this case, the event was canceled, so the resolution is p3. \n\nWait, the personalization instructions state: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But in this case, the event was canceled, so the condition for cancellation applies, which is p3. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

The user is asking about the outcome of the IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) scheduled for May 10, 2025, at 10:00 AM ET. The ancillary data specifies that if SRH wins, it's p2; if KKR wins, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the match happened as scheduled. The user provided several search results. Let me go through them. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's a result from May 9 (source [14]) where SRH announced ticket refunds because the IPL 2025 season was suspended due to military tensions between India and Pakistan. The match on May 10 was canceled. Another source [15] confirms that the SRH vs KKR clash on May 10 was scrapped, and tickets were refunded. \n\nThen, sources [16], [17], and [18] mention that the IPL was suspended but later resumed with a revised schedule starting from May 17. The original May 10 match wasn't played as planned. \n\nHowever, looking at the more recent search results (sources [1] to [13]), there's a match between SRH and KKR on May 25, 2025, which SRH won by 110 runs. This was Match 68 of the IPL 2025, held at Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the match scheduled for May 10. But the sources indicate that the May 10 match was canceled due to the suspension, and the teams played later on May 25 as part of the rescheduled matches. \n\nThe key point here is whether the May 25 match is considered the same event as the originally scheduled May 10 match. The ancillary data says if the game is postponed, the market remains open until completed. If canceled entirely with no make-up, resolve to p3. \n\nIn this case, the May 10 match was canceled, but a rescheduled match was played on May 25. However, the user's query specifically refers to the May 10 game. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are tied to that specific scheduled game. \n\nBut according to the sources, the May 10 game was canceled, not postponed. The BCCI suspended the IPL and later revised the schedule, which included a new match between SRH and KKR on May 25. This seems like a new fixture rather than a postponement of the original May 10 match. \n\nTherefore, the original May 10 match was canceled without being made up, and the May 25 match is a separate event. The resolution conditions state that if the game is canceled entirely with no make-up, it resolves to 50-50 (p3). \n\nHowever, the user might be conflating the two matches. But according to the instructions, I must ensure that the event resolved is the same as specified in the user prompt. The user's query is about the May 10 game, which was canceled. The May 25 match is a different fixture. \n\nTherefore, since the May 10 game was canceled and not made up, the market should resolve to p3 (50-50). However, I need to check if the rescheduled May 25 match is considered the make-up game. The sources mention that the revised schedule included remaining matches, but it's unclear if the May 25 match was a rescheduling of the May 10 game or part of the original fixture list. \n\nLooking at source [13], the May 25 match is referred to as Match 68, which might have been part of the original schedule. The original May 10 match might have been a different fixture (perhaps a home game for SRH), which was canceled and not rescheduled. The May 25 match was played at a neutral venue (Delhi), whereas the original May 10 match was supposed to be in Hyderabad (source [14], [15]). \n\nTherefore, the May 25 match is a different fixture, not a make-up of the canceled May 10 game. Hence, the May 10 game was canceled entirely without a make-up, leading to a resolution of p3. \n\nBut wait, the user's ancillary data says if the game is postponed, the market remains open until completed. If it's canceled with no make-up, resolve to 50-50. Since the May 10 game was canceled and not rescheduled, it should be p3. However, the teams did play later, but that's a different match. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p3. However, the user might have intended the May 25 match, but according to the strict terms, the query is about the May 10 game. \n\nBut looking at the user's personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, but the user prompt specifies the event was postponed or canceled, we need to check. The May 10 game was canceled, and the May 25 is a different match. \n\nThus, the resolution should be p3. However, the user might have updated the query to refer to the May 25 match, but the original query is about May 10. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is May 25, 2025, 19:46:34 UTC. The May 10 game was in the past, and it was canceled. The May 25 match is on the same day as the current timestamp, but the query is about the May 10 game. \n\nTherefore, the May 10 game was canceled, no make-up, so resolve to p3. But the user might have intended the May 25 match. However, the query explicitly states the May 10 game. \n\nBut looking at the search results, the May 25 match is between SRH and KKR, which SRH won. If the user's query is about the May 10 game, which was canceled, but the ancillary data's resolution is based on that specific game, then the answer is p3. However, if the user intended the rescheduled match on May 25, then it's p2. \n\nBut the user's query specifically mentions the May 10 game. Therefore, the resolution should be p3. However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But in this case, the event was canceled, so the resolution is p3. \n\nWait, the personalization instructions state: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But in this case, the event was canceled, so the condition for cancellation applies, which is p3. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p3.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Price: 0.9985, ID: 37641559514262367385523097834482092712788264318051481511603657139214584139303, Winner: No\n- Token: Kolkata Knight Riders, Price: 0.0015, ID: 76614561605233164094796665711963830570345696076022905323818999912869893675824, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 to Sunrisers Hyderabad, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 = Sunrisers Hyderabad\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Sunrisers Hyderabad outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) scheduled for May 10, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if SRH wins, it's p2; if KKR wins, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the May 10 match happened. Looking at the search results, there's a mix of information. Sources [2], [4], [8], [15], [16], [17] mention that the May 10 match was canceled due to the suspension of IPL 2025 because of India-Pakistan tensions. Specifically, SRH announced ticket refunds for this game, and the BCCI suspended the league. The scorecard in [8] shows the match as \"suspended\" with no result. \n\nHowever, there are reports of a match on May 25 (sources [3], [5], [7], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14]) where SRH defeated KKR by 110 runs. The user's additional instruction asks to consider if the May 25 match should be the resolved event for the May 10 query. \n\nThe key here is whether the May 25 match is a rescheduled version of the original May 10 fixture. The search results don't explicitly state that the May 25 game is a rescheduled match. Instead, it's referred to as Match 68, part of the regular season, while the May 10 match was Match 60. The original May 10 game was canceled, not postponed, and the May 25 match seems to be a different fixture, possibly part of the revised schedule after the suspension. \n\nSince the May 10 game was canceled and not rescheduled, per the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p3 (50-50). The May 25 match is a separate event and doesn't serve as a make-up for the canceled one. Therefore, despite SRH's victory on May 25, the original query's outcome remains unresolved, leading to a p3 resolution.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) scheduled for May 10, 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if SRH wins, it's p2; if KKR wins, p1; if postponed, the market stays open; if canceled, it's p3 (50-50). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the May 10 match happened. Looking at the search results, there's a mix of information. Sources [2], [4], [8], [15], [16], [17] mention that the May 10 match was canceled due to the suspension of IPL 2025 because of India-Pakistan tensions. Specifically, SRH announced ticket refunds for this game, and the BCCI suspended the league. The scorecard in [8] shows the match as \"suspended\" with no result. \n\nHowever, there are reports of a match on May 25 (sources [3], [5], [7], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14]) where SRH defeated KKR by 110 runs. The user's additional instruction asks to consider if the May 25 match should be the resolved event for the May 10 query. \n\nThe key here is whether the May 25 match is a rescheduled version of the original May 10 fixture. The search results don't explicitly state that the May 25 game is a rescheduled match. Instead, it's referred to as Match 68, part of the regular season, while the May 10 match was Match 60. The original May 10 game was canceled, not postponed, and the May 25 match seems to be a different fixture, possibly part of the revised schedule after the suspension. \n\nSince the May 10 game was canceled and not rescheduled, per the resolution conditions, the market should resolve to p3 (50-50). The May 25 match is a separate event and doesn't serve as a make-up for the canceled one. Therefore, despite SRH's victory on May 25, the original query's outcome remains unresolved, leading to a p3 resolution.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Sunrisers Hyderabad, Price: 0.9985, ID: 37641559514262367385523097834482092712788264318051481511603657139214584139303, Winner: No\n- Token: Kolkata Knight Riders, Price: 0.0015, ID: 76614561605233164094796665711963830570345696076022905323818999912869893675824, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 to Sunrisers Hyderabad, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 = Sunrisers Hyderabad\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Sunrisers Hyderabad outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The user is asking about resolving a market based on an IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) originally scheduled for May 10, 2025.

Looking at the sources, especially [10], [11], and [14], it's clear that the IPL 2025 season was suspended on May 9 due to military tensions between India and Pakistan. The match scheduled for May 10 in Hyderabad was canceled, and SRH announced ticket refunds. This cancellation is critical because the original query's resolution conditions mention that if the game is canceled without a make-up, it resolves 50-50 (p3).\n\nHowever, the revised schedule in [12] shows that the SRH vs KKR match was rescheduled to May 25 in Delhi. The user's additional instructions ask to consider if the May 25 match should be the resolved event instead. The search results [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [8], [9], and [13] all confirm that the May 25 match took place, with SRH winning by 110 runs. \n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The original May 10 match was canceled due to the suspension.\n2. The rescheduled match on May 25 was a different fixture, part of the revised schedule.\n3. The ancillary data states that if the game is postponed, the market remains open until completion. However, if canceled entirely without a make-up, it resolves 50-50. \n\nBut the May 10 game wasn't just postponed; it was canceled and replaced with a new match on May 25. The question is whether this rescheduled match counts as the same event. The ancillary data doesn't specify handling rescheduled matches as continuations. Since the original match was canceled and a new one was scheduled, the May 25 game is a separate event. Therefore, the original market should resolve based on the cancellation, leading to p3 (50-50). However, the user's additional instructions mention strong market sentiment towards SRH, possibly due to their May 25 win. But according to the resolution conditions, the market was tied to the May 10 game. The rescheduled match is a different event, so the May 25 result shouldn't affect the original market.

If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Sunrisers Hyderabad vs. Kolkata Knight Riders, description: In the upcoming IPL game, scheduled for May 10 at 10:00AM ET:\nIf the Sunrisers Hyderabad win, the market will resolve to \"Sunrisers Hyderabad\".\nIf the Kolkata Knight Riders win, the market will resolve to \"Kolkata Knight Riders\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Kolkata Knight Riders, p2 to Sunrisers Hyderabad, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.
