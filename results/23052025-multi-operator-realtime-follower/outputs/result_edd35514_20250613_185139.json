      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the match between Team Spirit and Natus Vincere (NAVI) at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. The event date is June 13, 2025, which is the same day as the current timestamp provided (June 13, 2025, 18:47:18 UTC). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current time is 6:47 PM UTC, which is 1:47 PM CDT. The match is scheduled for 1:30 PM CDT. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The user mentioned the match is at 1:30 PM ET, which is 12:30 PM CDT. But the search results show the match time as 1:30 PM CDT. Let me clarify the time zones. \n\nThe event is in Austin, which is CDT (UTC-5). The current timestamp is 18:47 UTC, which converts to 1:47 PM CDT. The match was scheduled for 1:30 PM CDT, so it should have started 17 minutes ago. However, the exact end time isn't specified. If the match is ongoing or hasn't started yet, it's still a future event relative to the current time. But according to the search results, some sources mention the match is part of Stage 3, Day 1, with specific times listed. For example, one source lists the match at 1:30 PM CDT (which is 18:30 UTC). The current time is 18:47 UTC, so the match would have started 17 minutes ago. However, without real-time data, I need to rely on the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are mentions of the match between Spirit and NAVI on June 13, 2025. Some sources (like [4], [6], [44]) indicate that the match is scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 17:30 CET (which is 15:30 UTC). Converting that to CDT (UTC-5), that would be 10:30 AM CDT. However, another source [1] lists the match at 16:45 CDT (Team Spirit vs. Lynn Vision) and 18:00 CDT (MOUZ vs. FaZe), with the NAVI vs. Nemiga match at 13:45 CDT. Another source [42] mentions that NAVI's next match against Spirit is at 19:30 CET, which is 1:30 PM CDT. This seems conflicting.\n\nWait, the user's query states the match is at 1:30 PM ET, which is 12:30 PM CDT. But the search results have varying times. For example, [27] mentions the match is at 1:30 PM CDT. Given the current time is 1:47 PM CDT, the match would have started 17 minutes ago. However, without real-time updates, I need to check if the search results provide any post-match information.\n\nLooking through the search results, most of them are pre-match analyses, predictions, or schedules. However, [42] and [21] mention that both Spirit and NAVI are 2-0 in Stage 3 and are set to face each other to determine the first team to advance to the playoffs. There's no indication in the provided search results that the match has concluded. Since the current timestamp is June 13, 2025, 18:47 UTC (1:47 PM CDT), and the match was scheduled for 1:30 PM CDT, it's possible the match is ongoing or just concluded. However, without explicit results in the provided context, I can't confirm the outcome.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, the recommendation should be p4. If the event is on the same day but later, it's still future. However, in this case, the match time (1:30 PM CDT) is slightly before the current time (1:47 PM CDT), but without confirmation of the result, the system might not have the data yet. \n\nBut wait, the search results include some post-match information for other matches on the same day. For example, [2] mentions that Virtus.pro, NAVI, and Team Spirit won both their matches on the first day. [7] and [8] discuss Spirit's victories over paiN and Lynn Vision. [42] details NAVI's wins over Nemiga and 3DMAX. However, there's no explicit mention of the Spirit vs. NAVI match result in the provided search results. \n\nSince the search results don't include the outcome of the Spirit vs. NAVI match, and the event's timestamp is just past the scheduled time, but the provided context doesn't have the result, I must assume that the event hasn't concluded yet or the result isn't available. Therefore, according to the guidelines, if the event is in the past but no verifiable outcome is found, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is 2025-06-13 18:47:18 UTC, which is 1:47 PM CDT. The match was scheduled for 1:30 PM CDT, so it's 17 minutes past the start time. Matches can last over an hour, especially if it's a BO3. Without results in the provided context, it's unclear if the match has concluded. Since the search results don't include the result, and the resolution source is HLTV, which isn't provided in the search results for this specific match, I can't verify the outcome. \n\nTherefore, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Spirit winning. The search results indicate Spirit is favored, with a higher ranking and recent dominant performances. However, without explicit confirmation, the safe recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve now). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the event time is very recent, and the search results might not have updated yet. Given the conflict between the event time and lack of results, and the instruction to default to p4 if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, but the event has already started, it's a gray area. However, since the match was scheduled for the same day and the current time is just after the start time, and no result is available in the provided context, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the match between Team Spirit and Natus Vincere (NAVI) at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. The event date is June 13, 2025, which is the same day as the current timestamp provided (June 13, 2025, 18:47:18 UTC). \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. The current time is 6:47 PM UTC, which is 1:47 PM CDT. The match is scheduled for 1:30 PM CDT. Wait, that's a bit confusing. The user mentioned the match is at 1:30 PM ET, which is 12:30 PM CDT. But the search results show the match time as 1:30 PM CDT. Let me clarify the time zones. \n\nThe event is in Austin, which is CDT (UTC-5). The current timestamp is 18:47 UTC, which converts to 1:47 PM CDT. The match was scheduled for 1:30 PM CDT, so it should have started 17 minutes ago. However, the exact end time isn't specified. If the match is ongoing or hasn't started yet, it's still a future event relative to the current time. But according to the search results, some sources mention the match is part of Stage 3, Day 1, with specific times listed. For example, one source lists the match at 1:30 PM CDT (which is 18:30 UTC). The current time is 18:47 UTC, so the match would have started 17 minutes ago. However, without real-time data, I need to rely on the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are mentions of the match between Spirit and NAVI on June 13, 2025. Some sources (like [4], [6], [44]) indicate that the match is scheduled for June 13, 2025, at 17:30 CET (which is 15:30 UTC). Converting that to CDT (UTC-5), that would be 10:30 AM CDT. However, another source [1] lists the match at 16:45 CDT (Team Spirit vs. Lynn Vision) and 18:00 CDT (MOUZ vs. FaZe), with the NAVI vs. Nemiga match at 13:45 CDT. Another source [42] mentions that NAVI's next match against Spirit is at 19:30 CET, which is 1:30 PM CDT. This seems conflicting.\n\nWait, the user's query states the match is at 1:30 PM ET, which is 12:30 PM CDT. But the search results have varying times. For example, [27] mentions the match is at 1:30 PM CDT. Given the current time is 1:47 PM CDT, the match would have started 17 minutes ago. However, without real-time updates, I need to check if the search results provide any post-match information.\n\nLooking through the search results, most of them are pre-match analyses, predictions, or schedules. However, [42] and [21] mention that both Spirit and NAVI are 2-0 in Stage 3 and are set to face each other to determine the first team to advance to the playoffs. There's no indication in the provided search results that the match has concluded. Since the current timestamp is June 13, 2025, 18:47 UTC (1:47 PM CDT), and the match was scheduled for 1:30 PM CDT, it's possible the match is ongoing or just concluded. However, without explicit results in the provided context, I can't confirm the outcome.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, the recommendation should be p4. If the event is on the same day but later, it's still future. However, in this case, the match time (1:30 PM CDT) is slightly before the current time (1:47 PM CDT), but without confirmation of the result, the system might not have the data yet. \n\nBut wait, the search results include some post-match information for other matches on the same day. For example, [2] mentions that Virtus.pro, NAVI, and Team Spirit won both their matches on the first day. [7] and [8] discuss Spirit's victories over paiN and Lynn Vision. [42] details NAVI's wins over Nemiga and 3DMAX. However, there's no explicit mention of the Spirit vs. NAVI match result in the provided search results. \n\nSince the search results don't include the outcome of the Spirit vs. NAVI match, and the event's timestamp is just past the scheduled time, but the provided context doesn't have the result, I must assume that the event hasn't concluded yet or the result isn't available. Therefore, according to the guidelines, if the event is in the past but no verifiable outcome is found, and the user prompt doesn't specify postponement or cancellation, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is 2025-06-13 18:47:18 UTC, which is 1:47 PM CDT. The match was scheduled for 1:30 PM CDT, so it's 17 minutes past the start time. Matches can last over an hour, especially if it's a BO3. Without results in the provided context, it's unclear if the match has concluded. Since the search results don't include the result, and the resolution source is HLTV, which isn't provided in the search results for this specific match, I can't verify the outcome. \n\nTherefore, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Spirit winning. The search results indicate Spirit is favored, with a higher ranking and recent dominant performances. However, without explicit confirmation, the safe recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve now). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the event time is very recent, and the search results might not have updated yet. Given the conflict between the event time and lack of results, and the instruction to default to p4 if the event is in the future relative to the current timestamp, but the event has already started, it's a gray area. However, since the match was scheduled for the same day and the current time is just after the start time, and no result is available in the provided context, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Spirit, Price: 0.993, ID: 45041949615875148442275033100195887827072933439189084064915735982658752028309, Winner: No\n- Token: NAVI, Price: 0.007, ID: 81101437664926613798061591976567620868239156980648406793350196699576238288122, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to NAVI, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = NAVI, p2 = Spirit\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Spirit outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.993 = 99.3% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Where p1 corresponds to NAVI, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = NAVI, p2 = Spirit\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Spirit outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.993 = 99.3% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
