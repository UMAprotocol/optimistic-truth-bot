      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Humbert vs. Shapovalov match at the Terra Wortmann Open. The event date is June 17, 2025, and the current timestamp is June 17, 2025, 14:53:57 UTC. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. Since the current date is the same as the event date, I need to verify if the match has taken place. The user provided several search results, including live scores and tournament schedules. Looking at the search results, some sources like [17] and [18] mention the match is scheduled for June 17, 2025, at specific times (10:40 UTC and 18:40 UTC). The current time is 14:53 UTC, which is after 10:40 but before 18:40. However, the exact start time might vary depending on the court schedule and previous matches. \n\nNext, I need to check if there are any reports of the match result. The search results [1], [5], [6], [14], [20], [21], [28], [33], [39], [46], [50], [51], [60] all discuss predictions and previews but don't report the actual result. Some sources like [8] and [16] show the tournament draw with the match listed but no result yet. There's no indication in the provided search results that the match has been completed, postponed, or canceled. \n\nSince the event is scheduled for today and the current time is 14:53 UTC, which is 2:53 PM, and the match is supposed to be on Schauinsland-Reisen Court at 2:00 PM local time (Halle, Germany is UTC+2 in June), that would make the match start at 12:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 14:53 UTC, which is 2 hours and 53 minutes after the scheduled start. However, tennis matches can be delayed due to previous matches running long or other factors. \n\nThe search results don't include any live updates or final scores for this specific match. Without official results from the Terra Wortmann Open website or credible reporting confirming the outcome, I can't definitively determine the winner. The user's instructions state that if the event is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, since the event is on the same day and the exact time isn't confirmed, it's possible the match hasn't occurred yet. \n\nGiven the uncertainty and the lack of conclusive evidence in the provided sources, the resolution should default to p4 (cannot be resolved at this time) if the event is still in the future. However, the current timestamp is past the scheduled start time, but without confirmation of the result, it's safer to recommend p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data if the match hasn't concluded or results aren't available. But according to the user's personalization, if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still considered future. Wait, the event was scheduled for 2:00 PM local time in Halle, which is UTC+2, so 12:00 UTC. The current time is 14:53 UTC, which is 2 hours and 53 minutes after the scheduled start. However, without live scores or results, it's unclear if the match has been played. \n\nIn such cases, the resolution should be p4 if the event hasn't occurred yet. But since the current time is after the scheduled start, but there's no result, and the user's instruction says if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. However, the exact timing isn't clear. The ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. But without any info, it's safer to go with p3 (50-50) if unresolved. Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: Shapovalov, p2: Humbert, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, resolve based on probable outcome. But the event date is today, which is the same as the current date. If the match was supposed to have already happened but no info, then we might have to assume based on conditions. However, the user's instruction also says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Since the current time is 14:53 UTC, and the match was at 12:00 UTC, but no results are found, perhaps the match is ongoing or delayed. Without official confirmation, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on probable outcome. But if the event is in the future (same day but later time), it's p4. Wait, the current timestamp is 2025-06-17 14:53:57 UTC. The match was scheduled for 2:00 PM local time in Halle, Germany, which is UTC+2, so 12:00 UTC. The current time is 14:53 UTC, which is 2 hours and 53 minutes after the scheduled start. If the match was at 12:00 UTC, it's already past, but without any results reported, it's possible the match was delayed or the results aren't available yet. In this case, since the event date is today and the match was scheduled but no result is found, and the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says if canceled or delayed beyond June 24, resolve to 50-50. Since it's still June 17, and the match might be delayed but not beyond June 24, but without confirmation, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the conflicting factors, but following the user's instruction to prioritize the provided URLs and current timestamp, and since there's no result in the search context, the safest recommendation is p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's resolution conditions. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. But without any info, perhaps the match hasn't occurred yet, so p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nThe event date is June 17, 2025, same as the current timestamp. The match was scheduled for 2:00 PM local time (12:00 UTC). Current time is 14:53 UTC, which is after the scheduled time. Therefore, the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp. Since no verifiable outcome is found in the search results, we need to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions say p2 is Humbert. The previews and predictions in the search results mostly favor Humbert to win, as seen in sources [1], [5], [6], [14], [21], [39], [46], [50], [51], [60]. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Humbert winning, so the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the Humbert vs. Shapovalov match at the Terra Wortmann Open. The event date is June 17, 2025, and the current timestamp is June 17, 2025, 14:53:57 UTC. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the event has already occurred. Since the current date is the same as the event date, I need to verify if the match has taken place. The user provided several search results, including live scores and tournament schedules. Looking at the search results, some sources like [17] and [18] mention the match is scheduled for June 17, 2025, at specific times (10:40 UTC and 18:40 UTC). The current time is 14:53 UTC, which is after 10:40 but before 18:40. However, the exact start time might vary depending on the court schedule and previous matches. \n\nNext, I need to check if there are any reports of the match result. The search results [1], [5], [6], [14], [20], [21], [28], [33], [39], [46], [50], [51], [60] all discuss predictions and previews but don't report the actual result. Some sources like [8] and [16] show the tournament draw with the match listed but no result yet. There's no indication in the provided search results that the match has been completed, postponed, or canceled. \n\nSince the event is scheduled for today and the current time is 14:53 UTC, which is 2:53 PM, and the match is supposed to be on Schauinsland-Reisen Court at 2:00 PM local time (Halle, Germany is UTC+2 in June), that would make the match start at 12:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 14:53 UTC, which is 2 hours and 53 minutes after the scheduled start. However, tennis matches can be delayed due to previous matches running long or other factors. \n\nThe search results don't include any live updates or final scores for this specific match. Without official results from the Terra Wortmann Open website or credible reporting confirming the outcome, I can't definitively determine the winner. The user's instructions state that if the event is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, since the event is on the same day and the exact time isn't confirmed, it's possible the match hasn't occurred yet. \n\nGiven the uncertainty and the lack of conclusive evidence in the provided sources, the resolution should default to p4 (cannot be resolved at this time) if the event is still in the future. However, the current timestamp is past the scheduled start time, but without confirmation of the result, it's safer to recommend p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data if the match hasn't concluded or results aren't available. But according to the user's personalization, if the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time, it's still considered future. Wait, the event was scheduled for 2:00 PM local time in Halle, which is UTC+2, so 12:00 UTC. The current time is 14:53 UTC, which is 2 hours and 53 minutes after the scheduled start. However, without live scores or results, it's unclear if the match has been played. \n\nIn such cases, the resolution should be p4 if the event hasn't occurred yet. But since the current time is after the scheduled start, but there's no result, and the user's instruction says if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. However, the exact timing isn't clear. The ancillary data says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. But without any info, it's safer to go with p3 (50-50) if unresolved. Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1: Shapovalov, p2: Humbert, p3: 50-50. The user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, resolve based on probable outcome. But the event date is today, which is the same as the current date. If the match was supposed to have already happened but no info, then we might have to assume based on conditions. However, the user's instruction also says if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Since the current time is 14:53 UTC, and the match was at 12:00 UTC, but no results are found, perhaps the match is ongoing or delayed. Without official confirmation, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on probable outcome. But if the event is in the future (same day but later time), it's p4. Wait, the current timestamp is 2025-06-17 14:53:57 UTC. The match was scheduled for 2:00 PM local time in Halle, Germany, which is UTC+2, so 12:00 UTC. The current time is 14:53 UTC, which is 2 hours and 53 minutes after the scheduled start. If the match was at 12:00 UTC, it's already past, but without any results reported, it's possible the match was delayed or the results aren't available yet. In this case, since the event date is today and the match was scheduled but no result is found, and the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on probable outcome. However, the ancillary data says if canceled or delayed beyond June 24, resolve to 50-50. Since it's still June 17, and the match might be delayed but not beyond June 24, but without confirmation, it's unclear. \n\nGiven the conflicting factors, but following the user's instruction to prioritize the provided URLs and current timestamp, and since there's no result in the search context, the safest recommendation is p3 (50-50) as per the ancillary data's resolution conditions. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume probable outcome. But without any info, perhaps the match hasn't occurred yet, so p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, and no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nThe event date is June 17, 2025, same as the current timestamp. The match was scheduled for 2:00 PM local time (12:00 UTC). Current time is 14:53 UTC, which is after the scheduled time. Therefore, the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp. Since no verifiable outcome is found in the search results, we need to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions say p2 is Humbert. The previews and predictions in the search results mostly favor Humbert to win, as seen in sources [1], [5], [6], [14], [21], [39], [46], [50], [51], [60]. Therefore, the most probable outcome is Humbert winning, so the recommendation should be p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Humbert, Price: 0.61, ID: 80745946752555055211022725891853280430233142282233221330631968628319920195837, Winner: No\n- Token: Shapovalov, Price: 0.39, ID: 36773054777230864761708370368651380314284813915745281204216928524901552620373, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Shapovalov, p2 to Humbert, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Shapovalov, p2 = Humbert\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Humbert (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.610 vs 0.390)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Other sources like [15], [31], and [32] provide previews and predictions but no actual results. \n\nSince the current timestamp is after the scheduled start but there's no explicit result in the provided sources, I should check if the event was postponed or canceled. The resolution conditions state that if the match is delayed beyond June 24, it resolves to p3. However, there's no indication of postponement in the search results. \n\nGiven the absence of a confirmed result in the sources and the match date being the same as the current date, but the time has passed, I need to infer based on the most probable outcome. The ancillary data specifies that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nThe predictions and H2H stats favor Humbert slightly. For example, [9] and [32] predict Humbert to win, and the H2H is 3-2 in favor of Shapovalov, but they haven't played on grass before. However, the user's personalization instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no info is available. \n\nBut wait, the user also mentioned that if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. The match was scheduled for 7 AM ET (11:00 UTC), and the current time is 14:53 UTC. So if the match was supposed to start at 11:00 UTC and it's now 14:53, it's possible the match is ongoing or completed. However, without explicit results in the provided sources, I can't confirm. \n\nSome sources like [11] show a live score with Humbert leading in the second set, but it's unclear if that's real-time or a placeholder. Since the sources don't provide a definitive result, and the resolution conditions require verifiable info, I should check if any sources confirm the result. \n\nLooking again, result [13] from the tournament's official site mentions Humbert's match against Shapovalov is scheduled for Tuesday, but no result is given. Other results like [28] and [41] also don't show completed results. \n\nSince the user's instructions say to use the provided search results and not external knowledge, and none of the sources confirm the result, I have to follow the ancillary data's fallback. If no verifiable outcome exists by the current timestamp (which is after the event date), resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nHowever, the user's personalization also states that if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. But in this case, the event's scheduled time (7 AM ET) has passed (current time is 14:53 UTC, which is 10:53 AM ET, so 7 AM ET is 3 hours prior). Therefore, the event should have occurred. \n\nGiven the lack of result in the sources, but the event date is in the past, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. The majority of predictions and H2H slightly lean towards Humbert, so the recommendation would be p2 (Humbert wins). However, the user's instructions say if no verifiable info, default to p4. Wait, no\u2014the personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. If it can't be inferred, default to p4. \n\nBut the resolution conditions here have p3 as 50-50, but the user's ancillary data defines p1: Shapovalov, p2: Humbert, p3: 50-50. However, the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the sources don't confirm, but the match was supposed to have happened, and there's no result, perhaps it's safer to go with p3. But the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, and the user prompt doesn't mention postponement, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the exact instruction: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nIn this case, the outcome can't be reasonably inferred because the sources don't provide the result, even though the time has passed. Therefore, default to p4? Wait, the resolution conditions here have p3 as 50-50, but the user's ancillary data says p3 is 0.5. However, the market's resolution_conditions are p1: Shapovalov, p2: Humbert, p3: 50-50. \n\nBut according to the user's personalization: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nWait, the user's resolution_conditions are p1: 0 (Shapovalov), p2:1 (Humbert), p3:0.5 (50-50). The market resolves to p3 if it's a tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 24. Since the current date is June 17, and the event was scheduled for June 17, it's not delayed beyond June 24 yet. However, the match was supposed to have occurred already. If there's no result, but it's not delayed beyond June 24, then it's not yet p3. But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the problem is that the provided search results don't include the actual result. All the sources are previews, draws, or live scores that don't show a completed match. Therefore, there's no verifiable information. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, answer as best as possible. But the personalization says to use the primary resolution source (the tournament's official site). Checking result [1], [2], [13], and [41], the official site's scores/draws don't show the result yet. For example, [41] shows the singles draw with the match as \"Not Started\". \n\nTherefore, since the official source hasn't updated the result, and the current time is after the scheduled start, but there's no confirmation of cancellation or postponement, the resolution should be p3 (50-50) only if it's delayed beyond June 24. Since it's still June 17, the delay isn't beyond June 24, so p3 isn't applicable yet. However, the match was supposed to occur on June 17, and if it's not completed by the current time, it might be considered canceled or delayed, but there's no info on that. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Given the instructions, if the event date is in the past (June 17) and no verifiable outcome, resolve based on the most probable outcome. The predictions lean towards Humbert, so p2. But if the match hasn't been played yet (e.g., delayed within the same day), it's still a future event. However, the current timestamp is June 17, 14:53 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 11:30 AM local time (Halle is UTC+2), which would be 9:30 AM UTC. So the match should have started by 9:30 AM UTC and likely concluded by 14:53 UTC. \n\nSince the official sources haven't updated the result, but the match time has passed, and there's no report of cancellation, the most probable outcome based on the available info (predictions favoring Humbert) would be p2. However, strictly following the instructions, if there's no verifiable info, we have to default to p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nTherefore, since the event date is in the past, and no verifiable outcome exists, assume the most probable outcome. The conditions in the user prompt (ancillary data) don't specify how to determine the most probable, but the search results include predictions favoring Humbert. Therefore, the recommendation is p2 (Humbert).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750172037 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 14:53:57 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please clarify the exact timing of the event relative to the current timestamp and verify the outcome directly from the primary resolution source or credible reports before making a recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Humbert vs. Shapovalov match at the Terra Wortmann Open. The key points here are verifying the outcome of the match based on the given resolution conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is June 17, 2025, 14:53:57 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 17 at 7:00 AM ET, which is 11:00 AM UTC. Since the current time is after the match's scheduled start, I need to determine if the match has occurred and its result.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match is scheduled for June 17. For example, result [1] states that Humbert will face Shapovalov on Tuesday (June 17) at 11:30 AM local time in Halle, which is UTC+2, making it 9:30 AM UTC. However, the exact time might vary, but the key is whether the match has been played by the current time of 14:53 UTC.\n\nNext, I need to check if there are any reports of the match result. The search results include live scores and predictions but no conclusive result. For instance, result [11] shows a live score with the match in progress, but it's unclear if it's completed. Other sources like [15], [31], and [32] provide previews and predictions but no actual results. \n\nSince the current timestamp is after the scheduled start but there's no explicit result in the provided sources, I should check if the event was postponed or canceled.

Where p1 corresponds to Shapovalov, p2 to Humbert, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Shapovalov, p2 = Humbert\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Humbert (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.610 vs 0.390)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The key points here are verifying if the event occurred as scheduled and determining the outcome based on the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is June 17, 2025, 14:53:57 UTC. The match was scheduled for June 17 at 7:00 AM ET, which is 11:00 AM UTC. Since the current time is after the scheduled start, the event should have already taken place. The user's instructions state that if the event is in the past and no outcome is found, we should assume the most probable outcome based on conditions unless contradicted by sources.\n\nLooking at the search results, multiple sources (like [1], [4], [9], [12], [15], [21], [28], [31], [35], [44], [52], [58]) mention the match is scheduled for June 17, 2025, on the Schauinsland-Reisen Court. However, none of the provided search results explicitly state the outcome of the match. Some sources, like [1] and [12], predict Humbert to win, but predictions aren't valid resolution sources. The official Terra Wortmann Open website ([3], [18], [20], [40]) doesn't list the result in the available snippets, and the draws ([2], [22], [51]) show the match as \"Not Started\" or without a result.\n\nThe user's instructions specify using the primary resolution source (the tournament's official site) or credible reporting. Since the official site's results ([17], [19], [49]) don't include this match's outcome in the snippets, and there's no credible report of the result in the provided sources, I can't confirm the winner. The event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but without verifiable outcome information, the resolution should default to p4 (unknown/50-50) as per the user's ancillary data. However, the user's note says if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the sources don't provide the actual result, and the match might still be ongoing or unreported in the given data, the safe resolution is p3 (50-50) as per the market's conditions if unresolved by June 24. But since the current date is June 17, and the event was today, but no result is found, it's possible the match hasn't concluded yet or the result isn't reported in the provided sources. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The predictions favor Humbert, but predictions aren't resolutions. Without official confirmation, the correct resolution is p3 (50-50) as per the market's terms if unresolved. Wait, the market says if canceled or delayed beyond June 24, resolve to 50-50. But since it's June 17 and the match was today, but no result found, perhaps it's still pending. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the instructions also say if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. However, the sources don't confirm the result, so the correct resolution is p3 (50-50). Wait, the resolution conditions are p1: Shapovalov, p2: Humbert, p3: 50-50. Since there's no official result in the sources, and the event date is today but after the scheduled time, but no result is reported, it's unclear. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable based on the sources' predictions is Humbert, but the official result isn't there. Since the primary source isn't showing the result, and the consensus of credible reporting isn't available in the provided sources, the resolution should be p3. But the user's note says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, without any official confirmation, it's safer to go with p3. But I'm conflicting between the instructions. The market resolves to 50-50 if canceled, delayed beyond June 24, or tied. Since it's June 17 and the match was today, but no result is found, perhaps it's still ongoing or the result isn't in the provided sources. Therefore, the correct resolution is p3 (50-50) because the outcome isn't verifiable from the given data.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

Where p1 corresponds to Shapovalov, p2 to Humbert, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Shapovalov, p2 = Humbert\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors Humbert (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.610 vs 0.390)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750172037 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 14:53:57 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a more concise analysis focusing on verifiable outcomes from the primary resolution source. Avoid speculative reasoning and ensure the recommendation aligns clearly with the resolution conditions."
