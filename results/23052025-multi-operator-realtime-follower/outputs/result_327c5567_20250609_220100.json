      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"President Xi\" during his May 16, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of \"President Xi\" by Trump in that interview. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles related to the May 16 interview. \n\nLooking at the search results, [1] is a transcript from the May 16 Special Report. In the transcript, Trump discusses his relationship with Middle Eastern leaders and mentions China in the context of a group being coaxed by China. However, the exact term \"President Xi\" isn't present here. \n\nResult [5] mentions a phone call between Trump and Xi on June 5, 2025, but that's after May 16, so it's not relevant. Result [64] also discusses a call in June, so same issue. \n\nResult [9] is a YouTube video from May 16, 2025, where Trump talks about China and his trip to the Middle East. The description mentions Trump discussing trade negotiations and plans for Gaza, but without the transcript, it's hard to confirm. However, the video's transcript snippet in [9] doesn't include \"President Xi.\"\n\nResult [41] is the full transcript of the May 16 Special Report. In the 3:04 pm segment, Trump talks about China influencing a group, but again, \"President Xi\" isn't used. He refers to China as a country, not by the leader's name.\n\nResult [56] from Asia Financial mentions Trump's May 16 interview where he said, \"If I didn't do that deal with China, I think China would have broken apart.\" But he refers to China, not President Xi specifically.\n\nResult [64] from Fox News on June 5 mentions a call with Xi, but that's after the May 16 interview. \n\nOther results like [58], [63], [66] refer to Trump's willingness to travel to China for talks with Xi, but these are from May 19 or later, so again, after the interview date.\n\nNone of the search results directly show Trump saying \"President Xi\" during the May 16 interview. He mentions China and trade deals but doesn't refer to Xi by name in the provided transcripts. Therefore, based on the available information, the answer should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nAfter reviewing the provided search results, including the transcript of the May 16, 2025, *Special Report* interview[1][41], there is no evidence that Donald Trump used the exact term **\"President Xi\"** during the conversation with Bret Baier. While Trump discussed China extensively and referenced trade negotiations[1][9][56], he did not explicitly name Xi Jinping in the cited segments. References to Xi in other sources[5][64] pertain to events after May 16 or unrelated contexts. Since the resolution criteria require the **exact term** \"President Xi\" and no instances are documented in the May 16 interview transcripts, the market resolves to **No (p1)**.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749506355 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 21:59:15 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said \"President Xi\" during his May 16, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of \"President Xi\" by Trump in that interview. The key sources here are the transcripts and articles related to the May 16 interview. \n\nLooking at the search results, [1] is a transcript from the May 16 Special Report. In the transcript, Trump discusses his relationship with Middle Eastern leaders and mentions China in the context of a group being coaxed by China. However, the exact term \"President Xi\" isn't present here. \n\nResult [5] mentions a phone call between Trump and Xi on June 5, 2025, but that's after May 16, so it's not relevant. Result [64] also discusses a call in June, so same issue. \n\nResult [9] is a YouTube video from May 16, 2025, where Trump talks about China and his trip to the Middle East. The description mentions Trump discussing trade negotiations and plans for Gaza, but without the transcript, it's hard to confirm. However, the video's transcript snippet in [9] doesn't include \"President Xi.\"\n\nResult [41] is the full transcript of the May 16 Special Report. In the 3:04 pm segment, Trump talks about China influencing a group, but again, \"President Xi\" isn't used. He refers to China as a country, not by the leader's name.\n\nResult [56] from Asia Financial mentions Trump's May 16 interview where he said, \"If I didn't do that deal with China, I think China would have broken apart.\" But he refers to China, not President Xi specifically.\n\nResult [64] from Fox News on June 5 mentions a call with Xi, but that's after the May 16 interview. \n\nOther results like [58], [63], [66] refer to Trump's willingness to travel to China for talks with Xi, but these are from May 19 or later, so again, after the interview date.\n\nNone of the search results directly show Trump saying \"President Xi\" during the May 16 interview. He mentions China and trade deals but doesn't refer to Xi by name in the provided transcripts. Therefore, based on the available information, the answer should be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nAfter reviewing the provided search results, including the transcript of the May 16, 2025, *Special Report* interview[1][41], there is no evidence that Donald Trump used the exact term **\"President Xi\"** during the conversation with Bret Baier. While Trump discussed China extensively and referenced trade negotiations[1][9][56], he did not explicitly name Xi Jinping in the cited segments. References to Xi in other sources[5][64] pertain to events after May 16 or unrelated contexts. Since the resolution criteria require the **exact term** \"President Xi\" and no instances are documented in the May 16 interview transcripts, the market resolves to **No (p1)**.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.5, ID: 80175545267982579125350147325002297130364080744991500310565859351316887592562, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.5, ID: 69807639781636546510623710802871073672396978492796960720086591752536278779664, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.500, NO: 0.500)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
