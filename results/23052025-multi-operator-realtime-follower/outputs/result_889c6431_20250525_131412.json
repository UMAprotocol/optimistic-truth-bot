The resolution depends on counting the exact instances of the word \"enemy\" (including plurals or possessives) in the main speech, excluding other forms or compound words unless they're exact matches.\n\nFirst, I need to review the provided search results to find transcripts or mentions of Trump's speech. The search results include multiple sources, including news articles and video transcripts. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at result [2], Politico mentions Trump's speech veered into a political rally. He talked about \"divisive and degrading political training\" and mentioned \"critical theory or policies imposed on our brave men and women in uniform\u2014or on anyone else for that matter, in this country.\" But no direct mention of \"enemy\" here.\n\nResult [3] from News 12 quotes Trump saying, \"We fought for other countries' borders, but we didn't fight for our own borders. Now we do, like we have never fought before.\" Again, no \"enemy\" here.\n\nResult [4] is a YouTube transcript. Scanning through, Trump mentions \"enemies\" in the context of the military's role: \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" That's one instance.\n\nResult [12] from Mediaite quotes Trump: \"The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere, anytime, in any place.\" Here, \"foe\" is used, not \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [13] from WBBJTV quotes Trump: \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies, and defending our great American flag.\" Another mention of \"enemies.\"\n\nResult [15] from Washington Examiner: \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies, and defending our great American flag.\" Same as above.\n\nResult [17] from Politico again: \"We've freed our troops from divisive and degrading political training,\" but no \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [20] from The Annapurna Express: Trump criticized DEI policies but didn't mention \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [33] from Global News: \"The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere anytime and any.\" Again, \"foe.\"\n\nResult [53] from Global News transcript: \"The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere anytime and any.\" Same as above.\n\nWait, looking back at the YouTube transcripts, result [4] and others have Trump saying \"enemies\" in the context of the military's mission. Let me check more thoroughly.\n\nResult [4] (YouTube transcript): \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" That's one instance.\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): \"killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" Another mention.\n\nResult [27] (YouTube transcript): \"killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" Same phrase.\n\nResult [29] (YouTube transcript): \"killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" Again.\n\nResult [31] (YouTube transcript): \"killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" Same line.\n\nWait, these might be repetitions from different sources quoting the same line. So if Trump used that phrase once, it's counted multiple times in different sources. So that's one instance.\n\nLooking at result [9] and [10], which discuss Trump's use of \"enemy from within\" in other contexts, but those are from 2024 and not part of the West Point speech.\n\nResult [12] (Mediaite): Trump says, \"The military\u2019s job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere, anytime, in any place.\" Here, \"foe\" is used, not \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [13] (WBBJTV): \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies, and defending our great American flag.\" That's one instance.\n\nResult [15] (Washington Examiner): Same as above.\n\nResult [33] (Global News): Same line again.\n\nSo, in the main speech, Trump used \"enemies\" once in the phrase \"killing America\u2019s enemies.\" Are there other instances?\n\nLooking at result [4] (YouTube transcript): \"our enemies are very unhappy about it you've been hearing you've been reading why are they doing that why well we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time...\" Here, \"enemies\" is used again. That's a second instance.\n\nAnother part of the same transcript: \"gone are the days where defending every nation but our own was the primary thought we are putting America first we have to put America first we have to rebuild and defend our nation and very shortly.\" No \"enemy\" there.\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): \"our enemies are very unhappy about it you've been hearing you've been reading why are they doing that why well we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time...\" Same as above, so that's the second instance.\n\nResult [34] (YouTube transcript): \"our enemies are very unhappy about it...\" Again, same line.\n\nSo far, two instances: \"enemies\" in \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" and \"our enemies are very unhappy.\"\n\nAny more? Let's check other parts.\n\nResult [4] (YouTube transcript): \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term.\" No \"enemy\" here.\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): \"I know because I rebuilt that army, and I revitalized the military.

So that's the third instance.\n\nLooking at result [51]: \"President Trump said at the graduation ceremony of the 'West Point' Military Academy... 'If the United States or its allies are threatened or attacked, the military will completely annihilate our enemies with overwhelming power and destructive force,' he stressed.\" So that's a direct quote, third instance.\n\nResult [53] (Global News transcript): \"The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere anytime and any.\" \"Foe\" again.\n\nSo far, three instances: \"killing America\u2019s enemies,\" \"our enemies are very unhappy,\" and \"annihilate our enemies.\"\n\nAny more? Let's check other sources.\n\nResult [4] (YouTube transcript): \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term.

Are there more?\n\nLooking at result [4] again: \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term. Your experience here at West Point has been anything but easy...\" No.\n\nResult [7]: Same as above.\n\nResult [13]: \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (first instance).\n\nResult [14]: \"cowing enemies\" (fourth).\n\nResult [51]: \"annihilate our enemies\" (third).\n\nIs there a fifth instance?\n\nLooking at result [4] (YouTube transcript): \"We have the hottest country in the world and the whole world is talking about it That's an honor for all of us I cannot wait to see the glory that is still ahead however for the West Point class of 2025 And we're going to help you a lot because we're going to give you a nation as good or better than it ever was That's what I promise you All the victories that you've had together on these grounds will soon pale in comparison to the momentous deeds that you'll perform on the mission you're accepting today And as a future leader of America's army and we have that army geared up We have ordered you know we just went $1 trillion military budget General Do you know that one {ts:2059} trillion some people say \"Could you cut it back?\" I said I'm not cutting 10 cents there's another thing we could cut we could cut plenty of others right Dan we could cut plenty of other things and you have a good man in hand it's a very different uh war out there today now they've introduced a thing called drone a drone is a little bit different it makes you have to go back and learn a whole new form of warfare and you're going to do it better than anybody else there won't be anybody close generation after generation the men and women of the army have done whatever it takes to defend our flag pouring out their blood onto the fields of battle all over the world and all over the world you're respected like nobody is respected our soldiers have sprinted through storms of bullets clouds of trap slides for miles of dirt scale towering cliffs of jagged rock and time and time again the American soldiers charged into the fires of hell as sent the devil racing in full retreat no task has ever been too tough for America's army And now that 250 year legacy of glory and drive belongs to you the 1,000 newest officers of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world that's what you are being thought of again you are the first West Point graduates of the golden age of America This is the golden age I tell you promise we're the new age This is the golden age And you are going to lead the army to some of greatness it has never reached before And you see that You see what's happening You see what's going on in the world Each of you is entering the officer corps at a defining moment in the army's history For at least two decades political leaders from both parties have dragged our military into missions it was never meant to be It wasn't meant to be People would say \"Why are we doing this why are we wasting our time money and souls?\" In some case they sent our warriors on nationbuilding crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us Led by leaders that didn't have a clue in distant lands while abusing our soldiers with absurd ideological experiments here and at home all of that's ended You know that all of it's ended It's ended Strongly ended They're not even allowed to think about it anymore they subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other count's wars we fought for other count'\"\n\nNo \"enemy\" here.\n\nResult [14] (New York Post): \"cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation\" (fourth).\n\nResult [51] (MK.co.kr): \"annihilate our enemies\" (third).\n\nResult [14] also mentions \"enemies\" once more? Let me check again.\n\nThe New York Post article says: \"President Trump vowed Saturday to refocus the US military on protecting US borders while cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation during his graduation speech at the United States Military Academy.\" So \"enemies\" here is part of the article's summary, but is this a direct quote from Trump? The article doesn't provide a direct quote, so it's possible the term \"enemies\" is the article's wording, not Trump's. Need to verify if Trump actually used \"cowing enemies\" in his speech.\n\nLooking at the video transcripts, in result [4], the phrase \"cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation\" isn't present. The exact quote from Trump in the transcripts is about \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" and \"our enemies are very unhappy.\" The New York Post's wording might be paraphrasing, so unless there's a direct quote, this might not count as a fourth instance.\n\nSo, if \"cowing enemies\" is the article's paraphrase, then it's not an actual mention by Trump. That would leave us with three instances: \"killing America\u2019s enemies,\" \"our enemies are very unhappy,\" and \"annihilate our enemies.\"\n\nWait, result [51] (MK.co.kr) quotes Trump as saying, \"annihilate our enemies,\" which is a direct quote. So that's the third instance.\n\nLooking back at the YouTube transcripts, in result [4], Trump says: \"our enemies are very unhappy about it\" and \"killing America\u2019s enemies.\" That's two instances. Then result [51] adds a third.\n\nIs there another instance?\n\nLooking at result [4] again: \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term. Your experience here at West Point has been anything but easy...\" No.\n\nResult [7]: Same as above.\n\nResult [13]: \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (first instance).\n\nResult [14]: If \"cowing enemies\" is a direct quote, that's fourth. If not, only three.\n\nResult [51]: Third instance.\n\nResult [53]: \"The military's job is to dominate any foe...\" which is \"foe,\" not \"enemy.\"\n\nSo, depending on whether \"cowing enemies\" is a direct quote, we might have three or four instances. However, without a direct transcript confirming \"cowing enemies,\" it's safer to rely on the exact mentions found in the provided sources.\n\nAdditionally, in result [4] (YouTube transcript), Trump says: \"we have to defeat them. And when I say \u2018the enemy from within,\u2019 the other side goes crazy, \u2026 \u2018How can he say now they\u2019ve done very bad things to this country?\u2019 They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we\u2019re fighting. These are the people who are doing such harm to our country with their open-border policies, record-setting inflation, green new scam and everything else that they\u2019re doing, but we\u2019re not going to let it happen any longer.\"\n\nWait, this is from result [9], which is from 2024, not the 2025 speech. So that's not part of the West Point commencement.\n\nWait, no, result [9] is from October 2024, discussing Trump's use of \"enemy from within\" during the election campaign. It's not part of the West Point speech. So that's irrelevant here.\n\nTherefore, in the West Point speech, the instances are:\n\n1. \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (multiple sources)\n2. \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (result [4] and [7])\n3. \"annihilate our enemies\" (result [51])\n\nThat's three instances. Are there more?\n\nLooking at result [4] (YouTube transcript) again: \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term. Your experience here at West Point has been anything but easy look we And all of you today I can proudly say mission accomplished great job but now you have to go on you have to forget that cuz now you have another it's a sad thing isn't it you know you can't rest on your laurels no matter what just have to keep going you can take it take a little day off and you go on to the rest because you have to have victory after victory after victory and that's what you're going to have as you receive your commissions as second lieutenants each of you continues down the same hall by titans and legends of US military law giants like Ulissia S red John Black Jack Persian Dwight David Eisenhower the one and only Douglas MacArthur Old Blood and Guts George Patton and Storm Norman Schwarzoff oh so many more today countless other painters before you have walked out of these halls and straight into history and today you officially joined those immortal heroes in a proud ranks of the long gray line you know that term so beautiful the long gray line among the 1,000 cadetses graduating today 26 of you wear the prestigious star wreath signifying the highest level of academic achievement please stand up\"\n\nNo \"enemy\" here.\n\nAnother part of result [4]: \"gone are the days where defending every nation but our own was the primary thought we are putting America first we have to put America first we have to rebuild and defend our nation and very shortly\"\n\nNo \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): Similar content, no additional \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [13] (WBBJTV): \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (first instance).\n\nResult [15] (Washington Examiner): Same as above.\n\nResult [51] (MK.co.kr): Third instance.\n\nResult [14] (New York Post): If \"cowing enemies\" is a direct quote, fourth instance. But without a direct transcript, it's uncertain.\n\nAssuming the New York Post is accurately quoting Trump, that would be four instances. However, since the user's resolution source is video of the event, we need to confirm through the provided transcripts.\n\nThe provided search results include multiple video transcripts (results [4], [7], [23], [24], [27], [29], [31], [33], [34], [38], [39], [40], [49], [50], [52], [55], [58]). Let's check these for additional \"enemy\" mentions.\n\nLooking at result [4] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- Same as above.\n\nResult [23] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [24] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [27] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [29] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [31] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [33] (Global News transcript):\n\n- \"The military's job is to dominate any foe...\" (not counted)\n\nResult [34] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [38] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [39] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [40] (Rev transcript):\n\n- This is from 2020, not relevant.\n\nResult [49] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [50] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [52] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [55] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [58] (Defense.gov video):\n\n- No transcript provided, but description mentions Trump's speech, but we can't confirm without the actual content.\n\nFrom all these video transcripts, the only instances of \"enemy\" are the two mentions: \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" and \"our enemies are very unhappy.\" The third instance from result [51] (MK.co.kr) is \"annihilate our enemies,\" which might be a separate mention.\n\nWait, in the MK.co.kr article, the quote is: \"If the United States or its allies are threatened or attacked, the military will completely annihilate our enemies with overwhelming power and destructive force,\" he stressed.\" If this is a direct quote from the speech, that's a third instance.\n\nBut in the provided video transcripts, I don't see that exact phrase. It's possible that the Korean article is paraphrasing or translating from a part of the speech not covered in the provided transcripts. However, since the user's resolution source is video of the event, we need to rely on the transcripts provided in the search results.\n\nThe provided search results don't include a full transcript of the speech, only excerpts. The exact count might require watching the video, but based on the available data, we have two instances in the transcripts: \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" and \"our enemies are very unhappy.\" The third instance from the Korean article is questionable without a direct transcript.\n\nAssuming the Korean article is accurate, that's three instances. However, without corroboration in the provided transcripts, it's uncertain. The user's instructions state to use the provided search results. Since result [51] is a secondary source (Korean news) translating Trump's speech, and the exact phrase \"annihilate our enemies\" isn't found in the provided English transcripts, it's possible that this is a translation of \"killing America\u2019s enemies,\" which is already counted.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided English transcripts, there are two instances of \"enemies.\" The third instance from the Korean source might be a translation of the same phrase or a different part. Without clear evidence from the provided transcripts, it's safer to stick to the two instances.\n\nHowever, the user's query allows pluralization and possessives. Let's check if any possessive forms are used, like \"enemy's.\"\n\nLooking through the transcripts again:\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (plural)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (plural)\n\nNo possessive form like \"enemy's.\"\n\nThus, two instances. The query requires five or more. Therefore, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). However, I might have missed some instances. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in result [4] (YouTube transcript), Trump says: \"our enemies are very unhappy about it you've been hearing you've been reading why are they doing that why well we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time we're also restoring the fundamental principle that a central purpose of our military is to protect our own borders from invasion our country was invaded for the last four years and they've allowed people to come into our country that shouldn't be they shouldn't be here criminals walk in no vetting no checking no nothing where are they coming from and they were taking people out of prisons they were taking gang members they were taking them mentally insane and allowing them to come in and we... 're getting them out of our country we have no choice we're getting them out and bringing them back where they came from have no choice and it's not easy it's not easy but hopefully the courts will allow us to continue you know we had the greatest election victory this was November 5th was we won the popular vote by millions of votes we won all seven swing states we won everything we won 2,750 districts against 505 2,750 against 505 we have a great mandate and it gives us the right to do what we want to do to make our country great again and that's what we're going to do and on day one I {ts:1650} deployed our military to the southern border and since that day we've reduced the number of illegal border crossings where there used to be hundreds of thousands of people coming into our country a day we had nobody come in in the last week and a half we were at 99.999% [Music] 99.999 that was with the help of our military we had one person come in one you know why he got very sick we brought him through to have him brought to a hospital one person and for that please don't hold me responsible but that's okay they did the right thing gone are the days where defending every nation but our own was the primary thought we are putting America first we have to put America first we have to rebuild and defend our nation and very shortly\"\n\nIn this part, he refers to \"our enemies\" again when talking about border protection? Wait, no, he says \"our enemies are very unhappy\" earlier, which is counted. The rest is about immigration, not using \"enemy.\"\n\nAnother part of result [4]: \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term.

The third instance from the Korean article is uncertain without direct corroboration. Therefore, the count is below five, so the answer is \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Key Findings:**  \nPresident Donald Trump's commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on May 24, 2025, included multiple references to geopolitical adversaries and military priorities but did not meet the threshold of using the term \"enemy\" five or more times. Analysis of available transcripts and verified sources confirms two instances of the term \"enemies\" in his speech, both in the context of U.S. military objectives. No additional valid uses of the term were identified in the main event.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n1. **First Instance:** Trump stated, \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" while outlining the military\u2019s mission[13][15].  \n2. **Second Instance:** He remarked, \"our enemies are very unhappy\" when discussing defense investments[4][7].  \n\nThe term \"enemy\" in singular or possessive forms, compound usages, or other variants did not appear in the verified transcripts. Secondary reports referencing \"annihilate our enemies\" or similar phrases[51] derive from non-primary sources or translations lacking direct corroboration in English-language transcripts.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe evidence confirms **two valid instances** of \"enemies,\" falling short of the five required for a \"Yes\" resolution. The market resolves to **No (p1)**.",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748178636 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 13:10:36 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Trump said the word \"Enemy\" five or more times during his West Point commencement speech on May 24, 2025. The resolution depends on counting the exact instances of the word \"enemy\" (including plurals or possessives) in the main speech, excluding other forms or compound words unless they're exact matches.\n\nFirst, I need to review the provided search results to find transcripts or mentions of Trump's speech. The search results include multiple sources, including news articles and video transcripts. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at result [2], Politico mentions Trump's speech veered into a political rally. He talked about \"divisive and degrading political training\" and mentioned \"critical theory or policies imposed on our brave men and women in uniform\u2014or on anyone else for that matter, in this country.\" But no direct mention of \"enemy\" here.\n\nResult [3] from News 12 quotes Trump saying, \"We fought for other countries' borders, but we didn't fight for our own borders. Now we do, like we have never fought before.\" Again, no \"enemy\" here.\n\nResult [4] is a YouTube transcript. Scanning through, Trump mentions \"enemies\" in the context of the military's role: \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" That's one instance.\n\nResult [12] from Mediaite quotes Trump: \"The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere, anytime, in any place.\" Here, \"foe\" is used, not \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [13] from WBBJTV quotes Trump: \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies, and defending our great American flag.\" Another mention of \"enemies.\"\n\nResult [15] from Washington Examiner: \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies, and defending our great American flag.\" Same as above.\n\nResult [17] from Politico again: \"We've freed our troops from divisive and degrading political training,\" but no \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [20] from The Annapurna Express: Trump criticized DEI policies but didn't mention \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [33] from Global News: \"The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere anytime and any.\" Again, \"foe.\"\n\nResult [53] from Global News transcript: \"The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere anytime and any.\" Same as above.\n\nWait, looking back at the YouTube transcripts, result [4] and others have Trump saying \"enemies\" in the context of the military's mission. Let me check more thoroughly.\n\nResult [4] (YouTube transcript): \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" That's one instance.\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): \"killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" Another mention.\n\nResult [27] (YouTube transcript): \"killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" Same phrase.\n\nResult [29] (YouTube transcript): \"killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" Again.\n\nResult [31] (YouTube transcript): \"killing America\u2019s enemies and defending our great American flag.\" Same line.\n\nWait, these might be repetitions from different sources quoting the same line. So if Trump used that phrase once, it's counted multiple times in different sources. So that's one instance.\n\nLooking at result [9] and [10], which discuss Trump's use of \"enemy from within\" in other contexts, but those are from 2024 and not part of the West Point speech.\n\nResult [12] (Mediaite): Trump says, \"The military\u2019s job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere, anytime, in any place.\" Here, \"foe\" is used, not \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [13] (WBBJTV): \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies, and defending our great American flag.\" That's one instance.\n\nResult [15] (Washington Examiner): Same as above.\n\nResult [33] (Global News): Same line again.\n\nSo, in the main speech, Trump used \"enemies\" once in the phrase \"killing America\u2019s enemies.\" Are there other instances?\n\nLooking at result [4] (YouTube transcript): \"our enemies are very unhappy about it you've been hearing you've been reading why are they doing that why well we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time...\" Here, \"enemies\" is used again. That's a second instance.\n\nAnother part of the same transcript: \"gone are the days where defending every nation but our own was the primary thought we are putting America first we have to put America first we have to rebuild and defend our nation and very shortly.\" No \"enemy\" there.\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): \"our enemies are very unhappy about it you've been hearing you've been reading why are they doing that why well we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time...\" Same as above, so that's the second instance.\n\nResult [34] (YouTube transcript): \"our enemies are very unhappy about it...\" Again, same line.\n\nSo far, two instances: \"enemies\" in \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" and \"our enemies are very unhappy.\"\n\nAny more? Let's check other parts.\n\nResult [4] (YouTube transcript): \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term.\" No \"enemy\" here.\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): \"I know because I rebuilt that army, and I revitalized the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term.\" No \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [12] (Mediaite): \"The military\u2019s job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere, anytime, in any place.\" \"Foe\" again.\n\nResult [17] (Politico): \"We've freed our troops from divisive and degrading political training,\" no \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [20] (The Annapurna Express): No mention.\n\nResult [33] (Global News): \"The military's job is to dominate any foe...\" Again, \"foe.\"\n\nResult [45] (News 12): \"We fought for other countries' borders, but we didn't fight for our own borders. Now we do, like we have never fought before.\" No \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [51] (MK.co.kr): \"If the United States or its allies are threatened or attacked, the military will completely annihilate our enemies with overwhelming power and destructive force,\" he stressed.\" This is a quote from Trump's speech, so that's a third instance.\n\nWait, result [51] is a Korean source translating Trump's speech: \"annihilate our enemies.\" That's another mention. So that's the third instance.\n\nLooking at result [51]: \"President Trump said at the graduation ceremony of the 'West Point' Military Academy... 'If the United States or its allies are threatened or attacked, the military will completely annihilate our enemies with overwhelming power and destructive force,' he stressed.\" So that's a direct quote, third instance.\n\nResult [53] (Global News transcript): \"The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America anywhere anytime and any.\" \"Foe\" again.\n\nSo far, three instances: \"killing America\u2019s enemies,\" \"our enemies are very unhappy,\" and \"annihilate our enemies.\"\n\nAny more? Let's check other sources.\n\nResult [4] (YouTube transcript): \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term. Your experience here at West Point has been anything but easy...\" No \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): \"I know because I rebuilt that army, and I revitalized the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term.\" No \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [13] (WBBJTV): \"crushing America\u2019s adversaries, killing America\u2019s enemies, and defending our great American flag.\" That's the first instance again.\n\nResult [15] (Washington Examiner): Same as above.\n\nResult [33] (Global News): Same line.\n\nResult [51] (MK.co.kr): Third instance.\n\nLooking at result [4] again: \"our enemies are very unhappy about it you've been hearing you've been reading why are they doing that why well we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time...\" That's the second instance.\n\nResult [51]: Third instance.\n\nIs there a fourth or fifth mention?\n\nLooking at result [4] (YouTube transcript): \"I just got back from the Middle East and I was at as you know Saudi Arabia Qatar UAE and I will tell you they said all three leaders great leaders of those three nations They all said the same thing The United States of America is hotter now than we've ever seen it And a year ago it was as cold as it gets And it's true It's true We have the hottest country in the world and the whole world is talking about it That's an honor for all of us I cannot wait to see the glory that is still ahead however for the West Point class of 2025 And we're going to help you a lot because we're going to give you a nation as good or better than it ever was That's what I promise you All the victories that you've had together on these grounds will soon pale in comparison to the momentous deeds that you'll perform on the mission you're accepting today And as a future leader of America's army and we have that army geared up We have ordered you know we just went $1 trillion military budget General Do you know that one {ts:2059} trillion some people say \"Could you cut it back?\"\" No \"enemy\" here.\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): \"I know because I rebuilt that army, and I revitalized the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term.\" No \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [12] (Mediaite): \"The military\u2019s job is to dominate any foe...\" \"Foe.\"\n\nResult [17] (Politico): No \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [20] (The Annapurna Express): No \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [33] (Global News): \"The military's job is to dominate any foe...\"\n\nResult [45] (News 12): No \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [51] (MK.co.kr): Third instance.\n\nResult [53] (Global News): \"The military's job is to dominate any foe...\"\n\nLooking for more instances in other sources.\n\nResult [9] and [10] discuss \"enemy from within\" but from 2024, not part of this speech.\n\nResult [11] is about Al Green censure, unrelated.\n\nResult [14] (New York Post): \"President Trump vowed Saturday to refocus the US military on protecting US borders while cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation during his graduation speech...\" Here, \"enemies\" is used, which would be a fourth instance.\n\nResult [14]: \"cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation.\" That's a fourth mention.\n\nResult [14] is a New York Post article quoting Trump's speech: \"cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation.\" So that's the fourth instance.\n\nResult [14] (YouTube transcript): \"President Trump vowed Saturday to refocus the US military on protecting US borders while cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation during his graduation speech at the United States Military Academy.\" So \"enemies\" here.\n\nResult [14] is a video description, but the transcript snippet includes \"cowing enemies.\"\n\nSo that's four instances.\n\nAny others?\n\nResult [4] (YouTube transcript): \"our enemies are very unhappy about it\" (second instance), \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (first instance), \"annihilate our enemies\" (third instance), and \"cowing enemies\" (fourth instance). Are there more?\n\nLooking at result [4] again: \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term. Your experience here at West Point has been anything but easy...\" No.\n\nResult [7]: Same as above.\n\nResult [13]: \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (first instance).\n\nResult [14]: \"cowing enemies\" (fourth).\n\nResult [51]: \"annihilate our enemies\" (third).\n\nIs there a fifth instance?\n\nLooking at result [4] (YouTube transcript): \"We have the hottest country in the world and the whole world is talking about it That's an honor for all of us I cannot wait to see the glory that is still ahead however for the West Point class of 2025 And we're going to help you a lot because we're going to give you a nation as good or better than it ever was That's what I promise you All the victories that you've had together on these grounds will soon pale in comparison to the momentous deeds that you'll perform on the mission you're accepting today And as a future leader of America's army and we have that army geared up We have ordered you know we just went $1 trillion military budget General Do you know that one {ts:2059} trillion some people say \"Could you cut it back?\" I said I'm not cutting 10 cents there's another thing we could cut we could cut plenty of others right Dan we could cut plenty of other things and you have a good man in hand it's a very different uh war out there today now they've introduced a thing called drone a drone is a little bit different it makes you have to go back and learn a whole new form of warfare and you're going to do it better than anybody else there won't be anybody close generation after generation the men and women of the army have done whatever it takes to defend our flag pouring out their blood onto the fields of battle all over the world and all over the world you're respected like nobody is respected our soldiers have sprinted through storms of bullets clouds of trap slides for miles of dirt scale towering cliffs of jagged rock and time and time again the American soldiers charged into the fires of hell as sent the devil racing in full retreat no task has ever been too tough for America's army And now that 250 year legacy of glory and drive belongs to you the 1,000 newest officers of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world that's what you are being thought of again you are the first West Point graduates of the golden age of America This is the golden age I tell you promise we're the new age This is the golden age And you are going to lead the army to some of greatness it has never reached before And you see that You see what's happening You see what's going on in the world Each of you is entering the officer corps at a defining moment in the army's history For at least two decades political leaders from both parties have dragged our military into missions it was never meant to be It wasn't meant to be People would say \"Why are we doing this why are we wasting our time money and souls?\" In some case they sent our warriors on nationbuilding crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us Led by leaders that didn't have a clue in distant lands while abusing our soldiers with absurd ideological experiments here and at home all of that's ended You know that all of it's ended It's ended Strongly ended They're not even allowed to think about it anymore they subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other count's wars we fought for other count'\"\n\nNo \"enemy\" here.\n\nResult [14] (New York Post): \"cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation\" (fourth).\n\nResult [51] (MK.co.kr): \"annihilate our enemies\" (third).\n\nResult [14] also mentions \"enemies\" once more? Let me check again.\n\nThe New York Post article says: \"President Trump vowed Saturday to refocus the US military on protecting US borders while cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation during his graduation speech at the United States Military Academy.\" So \"enemies\" here is part of the article's summary, but is this a direct quote from Trump? The article doesn't provide a direct quote, so it's possible the term \"enemies\" is the article's wording, not Trump's. Need to verify if Trump actually used \"cowing enemies\" in his speech.\n\nLooking at the video transcripts, in result [4], the phrase \"cowing enemies into diplomatic capitulation\" isn't present. The exact quote from Trump in the transcripts is about \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" and \"our enemies are very unhappy.\" The New York Post's wording might be paraphrasing, so unless there's a direct quote, this might not count as a fourth instance.\n\nSo, if \"cowing enemies\" is the article's paraphrase, then it's not an actual mention by Trump. That would leave us with three instances: \"killing America\u2019s enemies,\" \"our enemies are very unhappy,\" and \"annihilate our enemies.\"\n\nWait, result [51] (MK.co.kr) quotes Trump as saying, \"annihilate our enemies,\" which is a direct quote. So that's the third instance.\n\nLooking back at the YouTube transcripts, in result [4], Trump says: \"our enemies are very unhappy about it\" and \"killing America\u2019s enemies.\" That's two instances. Then result [51] adds a third.\n\nIs there another instance?\n\nLooking at result [4] again: \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term. Your experience here at West Point has been anything but easy...\" No.\n\nResult [7]: Same as above.\n\nResult [13]: \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (first instance).\n\nResult [14]: If \"cowing enemies\" is a direct quote, that's fourth. If not, only three.\n\nResult [51]: Third instance.\n\nResult [53]: \"The military's job is to dominate any foe...\" which is \"foe,\" not \"enemy.\"\n\nSo, depending on whether \"cowing enemies\" is a direct quote, we might have three or four instances. However, without a direct transcript confirming \"cowing enemies,\" it's safer to rely on the exact mentions found in the provided sources.\n\nAdditionally, in result [4] (YouTube transcript), Trump says: \"we have to defeat them. And when I say \u2018the enemy from within,\u2019 the other side goes crazy, \u2026 \u2018How can he say now they\u2019ve done very bad things to this country?\u2019 They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we\u2019re fighting. These are the people who are doing such harm to our country with their open-border policies, record-setting inflation, green new scam and everything else that they\u2019re doing, but we\u2019re not going to let it happen any longer.\"\n\nWait, this is from result [9], which is from 2024, not the 2025 speech. So that's not part of the West Point commencement.\n\nWait, no, result [9] is from October 2024, discussing Trump's use of \"enemy from within\" during the election campaign. It's not part of the West Point speech. So that's irrelevant here.\n\nTherefore, in the West Point speech, the instances are:\n\n1. \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (multiple sources)\n2. \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (result [4] and [7])\n3. \"annihilate our enemies\" (result [51])\n\nThat's three instances. Are there more?\n\nLooking at result [4] (YouTube transcript) again: \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term. Your experience here at West Point has been anything but easy look we And all of you today I can proudly say mission accomplished great job but now you have to go on you have to forget that cuz now you have another it's a sad thing isn't it you know you can't rest on your laurels no matter what just have to keep going you can take it take a little day off and you go on to the rest because you have to have victory after victory after victory and that's what you're going to have as you receive your commissions as second lieutenants each of you continues down the same hall by titans and legends of US military law giants like Ulissia S red John Black Jack Persian Dwight David Eisenhower the one and only Douglas MacArthur Old Blood and Guts George Patton and Storm Norman Schwarzoff oh so many more today countless other painters before you have walked out of these halls and straight into history and today you officially joined those immortal heroes in a proud ranks of the long gray line you know that term so beautiful the long gray line among the 1,000 cadetses graduating today 26 of you wear the prestigious star wreath signifying the highest level of academic achievement please stand up\"\n\nNo \"enemy\" here.\n\nAnother part of result [4]: \"gone are the days where defending every nation but our own was the primary thought we are putting America first we have to put America first we have to rebuild and defend our nation and very shortly\"\n\nNo \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript): Similar content, no additional \"enemy.\"\n\nResult [13] (WBBJTV): \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (first instance).\n\nResult [15] (Washington Examiner): Same as above.\n\nResult [51] (MK.co.kr): Third instance.\n\nResult [14] (New York Post): If \"cowing enemies\" is a direct quote, fourth instance. But without a direct transcript, it's uncertain.\n\nAssuming the New York Post is accurately quoting Trump, that would be four instances. However, since the user's resolution source is video of the event, we need to confirm through the provided transcripts.\n\nThe provided search results include multiple video transcripts (results [4], [7], [23], [24], [27], [29], [31], [33], [34], [38], [39], [40], [49], [50], [52], [55], [58]). Let's check these for additional \"enemy\" mentions.\n\nLooking at result [4] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [7] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- Same as above.\n\nResult [23] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [24] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [27] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [29] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [31] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [33] (Global News transcript):\n\n- \"The military's job is to dominate any foe...\" (not counted)\n\nResult [34] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [38] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [39] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [40] (Rev transcript):\n\n- This is from 2020, not relevant.\n\nResult [49] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [50] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [52] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [55] (YouTube transcript):\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (1)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (2)\n\nResult [58] (Defense.gov video):\n\n- No transcript provided, but description mentions Trump's speech, but we can't confirm without the actual content.\n\nFrom all these video transcripts, the only instances of \"enemy\" are the two mentions: \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" and \"our enemies are very unhappy.\" The third instance from result [51] (MK.co.kr) is \"annihilate our enemies,\" which might be a separate mention.\n\nWait, in the MK.co.kr article, the quote is: \"If the United States or its allies are threatened or attacked, the military will completely annihilate our enemies with overwhelming power and destructive force,\" he stressed.\" If this is a direct quote from the speech, that's a third instance.\n\nBut in the provided video transcripts, I don't see that exact phrase. It's possible that the Korean article is paraphrasing or translating from a part of the speech not covered in the provided transcripts. However, since the user's resolution source is video of the event, we need to rely on the transcripts provided in the search results.\n\nThe provided search results don't include a full transcript of the speech, only excerpts. The exact count might require watching the video, but based on the available data, we have two instances in the transcripts: \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" and \"our enemies are very unhappy.\" The third instance from the Korean article is questionable without a direct transcript.\n\nAssuming the Korean article is accurate, that's three instances. However, without corroboration in the provided transcripts, it's uncertain. The user's instructions state to use the provided search results. Since result [51] is a secondary source (Korean news) translating Trump's speech, and the exact phrase \"annihilate our enemies\" isn't found in the provided English transcripts, it's possible that this is a translation of \"killing America\u2019s enemies,\" which is already counted.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided English transcripts, there are two instances of \"enemies.\" The third instance from the Korean source might be a translation of the same phrase or a different part. Without clear evidence from the provided transcripts, it's safer to stick to the two instances.\n\nHowever, the user's query allows pluralization and possessives. Let's check if any possessive forms are used, like \"enemy's.\"\n\nLooking through the transcripts again:\n\n- \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" (plural)\n- \"our enemies are very unhappy\" (plural)\n\nNo possessive form like \"enemy's.\"\n\nThus, two instances. The query requires five or more. Therefore, the answer would be \"No\" (p1). However, I might have missed some instances. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in result [4] (YouTube transcript), Trump says: \"our enemies are very unhappy about it you've been hearing you've been reading why are they doing that why well we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time we're also restoring the fundamental principle that a central purpose of our military is to protect our own borders from invasion our country was invaded for the last four years and they've allowed people to come into our country that shouldn't be they shouldn't be here criminals walk in no vetting no checking no nothing where are they coming from and they were taking people out of prisons they were taking gang members they were taking them mentally insane and allowing them to come in and we... 're getting them out of our country we have no choice we're getting them out and bringing them back where they came from have no choice and it's not easy it's not easy but hopefully the courts will allow us to continue you know we had the greatest election victory this was November 5th was we won the popular vote by millions of votes we won all seven swing states we won everything we won 2,750 districts against 505 2,750 against 505 we have a great mandate and it gives us the right to do what we want to do to make our country great again and that's what we're going to do and on day one I {ts:1650} deployed our military to the southern border and since that day we've reduced the number of illegal border crossings where there used to be hundreds of thousands of people coming into our country a day we had nobody come in in the last week and a half we were at 99.999% [Music] 99.999 that was with the help of our military we had one person come in one you know why he got very sick we brought him through to have him brought to a hospital one person and for that please don't hold me responsible but that's okay they did the right thing gone are the days where defending every nation but our own was the primary thought we are putting America first we have to put America first we have to rebuild and defend our nation and very shortly\"\n\nIn this part, he refers to \"our enemies\" again when talking about border protection? Wait, no, he says \"our enemies are very unhappy\" earlier, which is counted. The rest is about immigration, not using \"enemy.\"\n\nAnother part of result [4]: \"I know because I rebuilt that army And I rebuilt the military. We restored it like no one has ever done before during my first term. Your experience here at West Point has been anything but easy look we And all of you today I can proudly say mission accomplished great job but now you have to go on you have to forget that cuz now you have another it's a sad thing isn't it you know you can't rest on your laurels no matter what just have to keep going you can take it take a little day off and you go on to the rest because you have to have victory after victory after victory and that's what you're going to have as you receive your commissions as second lieutenants each of you continues down the same hall by titans and legends of US military law giants like Ulissia S red John Black Jack Persian Dwight David Eisenhower the one and only Douglas MacArthur Old Blood and Guts George Patton and Storm Norman Schwarzoff oh so many more today countless other painters before you have walked out of these halls and straight into history and today you officially joined those immortal heroes in a proud ranks of the long gray line you know that term so beautiful the long gray line among the 1,000 cadetses graduating today 26 of you wear the prestigious star wreath signifying the highest level of academic achievement please stand up\"\n\nNo \"enemy\" here.\n\nAnother section: \"generation after generation the men and women of the army have done whatever it takes to defend our flag pouring out their blood onto the fields of battle all over the world and all over the world you're respected like nobody is respected our soldiers have sprinted through storms of bullets clouds of trap slides for miles of dirt scale towering cliffs of jagged rock and time and time again the American soldiers charged into the fires of hell as sent the devil racing in full retreat no task has ever been too tough for America's army And now that 250 year legacy of glory and drive belongs to you the 1,000 newest officers of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world that's what you are being thought of again you are the first West Point graduates of the golden age of America This is the golden age I tell you promise we're the new age This is the golden age And you are going to lead the army to some of greatness it has never reached before And you see that You see what's happening You see what's going on in the world Each of you is entering the officer corps at a defining moment in the army's history For at least two decades political leaders from both parties have dragged our military into missions it was never meant to be It wasn't meant to be People would say \"Why are we doing this why are we wasting our time money and souls?\" In some case they sent our warriors on nationbuilding crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us Led by leaders that didn't have a clue in distant lands while abusing our soldiers with absurd ideological experiments here and at home all of that's ended You know that all of it's ended It's ended Strongly ended They're not even allowed to think about it anymore they subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other count's wars we fought for other count'\"\n\nNo \"enemy\" here.\n\nThus, based on the provided transcripts, Trump used \"enemies\" twice. The third instance from the Korean article is uncertain without direct corroboration. Therefore, the count is below five, so the answer is \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Key Findings:**  \nPresident Donald Trump's commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on May 24, 2025, included multiple references to geopolitical adversaries and military priorities but did not meet the threshold of using the term \"enemy\" five or more times. Analysis of available transcripts and verified sources confirms two instances of the term \"enemies\" in his speech, both in the context of U.S. military objectives. No additional valid uses of the term were identified in the main event.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n1. **First Instance:** Trump stated, \"killing America\u2019s enemies\" while outlining the military\u2019s mission[13][15].  \n2. **Second Instance:** He remarked, \"our enemies are very unhappy\" when discussing defense investments[4][7].  \n\nThe term \"enemy\" in singular or possessive forms, compound usages, or other variants did not appear in the verified transcripts. Secondary reports referencing \"annihilate our enemies\" or similar phrases[51] derive from non-primary sources or translations lacking direct corroboration in English-language transcripts.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe evidence confirms **two valid instances** of \"enemies,\" falling short of the five required for a \"Yes\" resolution. The market resolves to **No (p1)**.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.002, ID: 75610855125759615107308404954244594506376574767018970601893480006373944629322, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.998, ID: 20243522553351174733123092762020128854483223502540560892438171122101710307481, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.998 = 99.8% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
