      "prompt": null,
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the B8 vs. HEROIC match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The market resolves to B8 if they win, HEROIC if they win, or 50-50 if there's a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 28, 2025. The resolution source is HLTV.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the match occurred as scheduled on June 8, 2025. The current date is June 8, 2025, 16:54:10 UTC. The match was set for 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. So the match should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. For example, result [7] from Strafe.com states the match was on June 8, 2025, at 4:15 PM (UTC), which aligns with the scheduled time. The same source also mentions that Strafe users predict HEROIC to win with 71.6% of the votes. However, predictions aren't results.\n\nResult [12] from egamersworld.com's blog post on June 8, 2025, lists the match as part of the schedule but doesn't provide the outcome. Similarly, result [52] from the same site's blog on the same day mentions the match is upcoming but doesn't give results. \n\nResult [24] from cs2grove.com's recap of Stage 2 Day 1 mentions that HEROIC lost to FaZe Clan 13-3, but that's a different match. There's no direct mention of the B8 vs. HEROIC result in the provided search results. \n\nSince the user specified HLTV as the resolution source, I should check if any of the HLTV results (e.g., [1], [9], [25], [59]) mention the outcome. Result [25] from HLTV's matches page doesn't list the specific match result. The other HLTV links are about the event hub or player stats, not the specific match result.\n\nGiven that the search results don't include the actual outcome of the B8 vs. HEROIC match and the current date is the same as the match date, it's possible the result hasn't been updated yet. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But since the match was today and the current time is after the scheduled time, but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the user's instructions also say if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the current timestamp is 16:54 UTC, and the match was at 16:15 UTC. So the match should have concluded. But without explicit results in the provided sources, I can't confirm the outcome. \n\nHowever, result [7] and [50] mention that the match is a Best of 1, and B8 is ranked #21 while HEROIC is #10. But without the actual result, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says p2 is B8, p1 is HEROIC. The sources have HEROIC as favorites (71.6% prediction), but predictions aren't results. Since there's no result in the provided sources, and the event date is today but after the match time, but no info, the resolution would default to p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the match was at 16:15 UTC, current time is 16:54, so it's past. But the sources don't have the result. Therefore, according to the user's rules, if no verifiable info, and event date is past, assume most probable outcome. The most probable based on rankings and predictions is HEROIC (p1). But the user's instructions say if no info, resolve based on most probable as per conditions. However, the market's resolution conditions say if the match is delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since it's June 8, the match wasn't delayed beyond June 28, so that doesn't apply. Therefore, without the result available in the provided sources, but the event date has passed, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. But the user's instructions for the oracle say if no verifiable info, and the event date is past, assume most probable. However, the ancillary data defines p1 as HEROIC, p2 as B8. Since the sources don't confirm the result, but the event date is past, and the resolution source is HLTV, which isn't showing the result in the provided snippets, the correct resolution would be p3 (50-50) only if the match was canceled or delayed beyond June 28. Since it's not delayed beyond June 28, but the result isn't found, perhaps the answer is p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume most probable. But the market's resolution says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since the match happened on time, but no result is found, perhaps the resolution is p3. But I'm confused. Wait, the market's resolution conditions say if the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since the match was played on June 8, not delayed, and assuming it wasn't a tie (CS:GO matches are Bo1, so no tie unless it's a draw, which is rare), but without the result, how to resolve? The user's instructions say if no verifiable info, answer as best as possible. Since the sources don't have the result, but the event date is past, and the resolution source is HLTV, which isn't showing the result in the provided data, perhaps the answer is p3. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. So HEROIC (p1). But I need to check if any sources mention the result. Wait, result [24] from cs2grove.com mentions that in Stage 2 Day 1, B8 defeated Falcons 13-9, but that's a different match. Result [56] from blast.tv's recap of Stage 2 round 1 mentions FaZe stomping HEROIC 13-3, but that's a different match (FaZe vs HEROIC), not B8 vs HEROIC. Result [57] from blast.tv's round 2 recap mentions Falcons going 0-2, losing to B8 and Lynn Vision, but again, not the B8 vs HEROIC match. Result [58] from skin.club's article on June 4 talks about HEROIC and B8 advancing to Stage 2, but that's before the match in question. \n\nSince none of the provided search results include the actual outcome of the B8 vs HEROIC match on June 8, and the resolution source (HLTV) isn't showing the result in the snippets, I have to conclude that there's no verifiable information available in the provided context. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, answer as best as possible with existing knowledge. But since the assistant must rely only on the provided search results, and they don't contain the match result, the resolution would default to p3 (50-50) only if the match was tied, canceled, or delayed. However, the match was played on time, so unless it was a tie, which is unlikely in a Bo1, the resolution should be based on the actual result. Since the result isn't found, but the event date is past, the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. Given that HEROIC is higher ranked (#10 vs #21) and was predicted to win by 71.6% in the Strafe poll, the most probable outcome is HEROIC (p1). However, the assistant must strictly use the provided sources. Since the sources don't confirm the result, but the event date is past, the correct resolution according to the user's rules is to assume the most probable outcome, which is HEROIC (p1). But I need to check if any source actually mentions the result. \n\nWait, result [12] from egamersworld.com's blog on June 8 lists the match as part of the schedule but doesn't give the result. Result [52] from the same site's blog on June 8 also lists the match as upcoming but no result. Result [7], [50], [60] from Strafe.com mention the match details but no result. Since none of the provided sources have the result, and the current date is the same as the match date, but after the match time, but no result is available, the resolution would be p3 (50-50) only if the match was not played or tied. However, since the match was scheduled and there's no indication of cancellation, and CS:GO matches typically don't end in ties in Bo1 (they go into overtime until a winner is decided), the most accurate resolution would be based on the actual result. But without the result in the sources, the assistant can't confirm. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable information is available, answer as best as possible. Since the match date is in the past, and the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome, which is HEROIC, the resolution would be p1. However, the assistant must ensure that the event is not future. Since the match was on June 8, 2025, and the current timestamp is June 8, 2025, 16:54 UTC, which is after the match time (16:15 UTC), the event is in the past. Therefore, the assistant should resolve based on the most probable outcome, which is HEROIC (p1). But the problem is that the provided search results don't include the actual result. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided search results and if they are empty, answer as best as possible. Since the search results don't have the result, but the event is in the past, the resolution is p1 (HEROIC) as the most probable outcome. But I need to check if any source mentions the result. \n\nWait, result [24] from cs2grove.com's recap on June 8 mentions that in Stage 2 Day 1, B8 defeated Falcons 13-9. Then in the same recap, under Round 3 schedule, it lists B8 vs HEROIC at 19:15 EEST (which is 16:15 UTC). Since the recap is from June 8, but the match was scheduled for that time, and the recap doesn't mention the result, it's possible the match hadn't happened yet when the recap was written. However, the current timestamp is 16:54 UTC, which is after the match time. But the provided search results don't include any post-match reports. Therefore, the assistant has to conclude that there's no verifiable information in the provided context, and according to the user's instructions, if no info, assume the most probable outcome. Hence, recommendation: p1 (HEROIC).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749401650 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 16:54:10 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the B8 vs. HEROIC match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The market resolves to B8 if they win, HEROIC if they win, or 50-50 if there's a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 28, 2025. The resolution source is HLTV.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the match occurred as scheduled on June 8, 2025. The current date is June 8, 2025, 16:54:10 UTC. The match was set for 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. So the match should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. For example, result [7] from Strafe.com states the match was on June 8, 2025, at 4:15 PM (UTC), which aligns with the scheduled time. The same source also mentions that Strafe users predict HEROIC to win with 71.6% of the votes. However, predictions aren't results.\n\nResult [12] from egamersworld.com's blog post on June 8, 2025, lists the match as part of the schedule but doesn't provide the outcome. Similarly, result [52] from the same site's blog on the same day mentions the match is upcoming but doesn't give results. \n\nResult [24] from cs2grove.com's recap of Stage 2 Day 1 mentions that HEROIC lost to FaZe Clan 13-3, but that's a different match. There's no direct mention of the B8 vs. HEROIC result in the provided search results. \n\nSince the user specified HLTV as the resolution source, I should check if any of the HLTV results (e.g., [1], [9], [25], [59]) mention the outcome. Result [25] from HLTV's matches page doesn't list the specific match result. The other HLTV links are about the event hub or player stats, not the specific match result.\n\nGiven that the search results don't include the actual outcome of the B8 vs. HEROIC match and the current date is the same as the match date, it's possible the result hasn't been updated yet. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But since the match was today and the current time is after the scheduled time, but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the user's instructions also say if the event is on the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the current timestamp is 16:54 UTC, and the match was at 16:15 UTC. So the match should have concluded. But without explicit results in the provided sources, I can't confirm the outcome. \n\nHowever, result [7] and [50] mention that the match is a Best of 1, and B8 is ranked #21 while HEROIC is #10. But without the actual result, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info is available and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data says p2 is B8, p1 is HEROIC. The sources have HEROIC as favorites (71.6% prediction), but predictions aren't results. Since there's no result in the provided sources, and the event date is today but after the match time, but no info, the resolution would default to p4 (cannot resolve), but the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say if the event is scheduled for the same day but later time, it's still future. Wait, the match was at 16:15 UTC, current time is 16:54, so it's past. But the sources don't have the result. Therefore, according to the user's rules, if no verifiable info, and event date is past, assume most probable outcome. The most probable based on rankings and predictions is HEROIC (p1). But the user's instructions say if no info, resolve based on most probable as per conditions. However, the market's resolution conditions say if the match is delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since it's June 8, the match wasn't delayed beyond June 28, so that doesn't apply. Therefore, without the result available in the provided sources, but the event date has passed, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. But the user's instructions for the oracle say if no verifiable info, and the event date is past, assume most probable. However, the ancillary data defines p1 as HEROIC, p2 as B8. Since the sources don't confirm the result, but the event date is past, and the resolution source is HLTV, which isn't showing the result in the provided snippets, the correct resolution would be p3 (50-50) only if the match was canceled or delayed beyond June 28. Since it's not delayed beyond June 28, but the result isn't found, perhaps the answer is p3. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume most probable. But the market's resolution says if the match is canceled or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since the match happened on time, but no result is found, perhaps the resolution is p3. But I'm confused. Wait, the market's resolution conditions say if the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, resolve to 50-50. Since the match was played on June 8, not delayed, and assuming it wasn't a tie (CS:GO matches are Bo1, so no tie unless it's a draw, which is rare), but without the result, how to resolve? The user's instructions say if no verifiable info, answer as best as possible. Since the sources don't have the result, but the event date is past, and the resolution source is HLTV, which isn't showing the result in the provided data, perhaps the answer is p3. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume most probable outcome. So HEROIC (p1). But I need to check if any sources mention the result. Wait, result [24] from cs2grove.com mentions that in Stage 2 Day 1, B8 defeated Falcons 13-9, but that's a different match. Result [56] from blast.tv's recap of Stage 2 round 1 mentions FaZe stomping HEROIC 13-3, but that's a different match (FaZe vs HEROIC), not B8 vs HEROIC. Result [57] from blast.tv's round 2 recap mentions Falcons going 0-2, losing to B8 and Lynn Vision, but again, not the B8 vs HEROIC match. Result [58] from skin.club's article on June 4 talks about HEROIC and B8 advancing to Stage 2, but that's before the match in question. \n\nSince none of the provided search results include the actual outcome of the B8 vs HEROIC match on June 8, and the resolution source (HLTV) isn't showing the result in the snippets, I have to conclude that there's no verifiable information available in the provided context. According to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, answer as best as possible with existing knowledge. But since the assistant must rely only on the provided search results, and they don't contain the match result, the resolution would default to p3 (50-50) only if the match was tied, canceled, or delayed.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the B8 vs. HEROIC match in the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The market resolves to B8 (p2) if they win, HEROIC (p1) if they win, and 50-50 (p3) if it's a tie, canceled, or delayed past June 28, 2025. The resolution source is HLTV.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given current timestamp is June 8, 2025, 16:54:10 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. So the match time was 16:15 UTC, and the current time is 16:54 UTC, which is after the match should have started. However, the exact end time isn't specified, but since it's a BO1, it's likely concluded by now.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match details. For example, result [1] states the match is part of Stage 2 and was played on June 8, 2025, at 12:15 PM (which is 16:15 UTC). The search results don't explicitly state the outcome, but some sources like [9] and [12] provide predictions. However, predictions aren't results. \n\nResult [59] from egamersworld.com on June 8, 2025, lists the standings after Round 1 and 2 of Stage 2, showing B8 at 1-1 and HEROIC at 1-1. This suggests the match in question (Round 3) hasn't been reported yet in that article. \n\nResult [52] is a YouTube video titled \"Upsets - Day 5 BLAST.tv Austin Major | No Comment\" uploaded on June 8, 2025, which might include match highlights, but without watching the video, I can't confirm the result. \n\nOther results like [1], [14], [19], [25], [29], [43], [45], [53], [64] all list the match details but don't provide the outcome. Since the user specified HLTV as the resolution source, I should check if HLTV has the result. However, result [7], [33], [38] are HLTV links, but the content provided doesn't include the specific match result. \n\nGiven that the current time is after the match's scheduled time and no sources in the provided context confirm the result, but the user instructions say to assume the most probable outcome if no verifiable info is available. The ancillary data defines p1 as HEROIC and p2 as B8. \n\nLooking at head-to-head stats from [2], [31], [39], Heroic has a 3-1 record against B8. Recent form from [9] mentions Heroic's higher win probability. However, [9] also predicts a B8 win, but that's a prediction, not a result. \n\nSince the match date is in the past relative to the current timestamp and no outcome is reported, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable info exists, resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the user also mentioned to check if the event is in the future. The match was scheduled for June 8, 2025, 12:15 PM ET (16:15 UTC), and the current time is 16:54 UTC on the same day. If the match hasn't concluded yet (e.g., it's a BO1 that started at 16:15 and is still ongoing), it's technically a future event. But the user's current time is 16:54, which is 39 minutes after the match start. A BO1 typically lasts about 30-60 minutes, so it's possible the match is ongoing or just finished. However, without explicit results, the safe resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve now). But the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the match date is today, June 8, 2025, and the current time is 16:54 UTC, which is after the match's start time (16:15 UTC), but the exact end time isn't known. If the match is scheduled for 16:15 and it's now 16:54, it's possible the match has concluded. However, without any sources confirming the result, and given the instructions, if no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut the user also says: \"If the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" Here, the event was at 16:15, current time is 16:54. If the event hasn't concluded (e.g., it's a long match), it's still ongoing. However, BO1s usually don't take that long. But without confirmation, it's safer to check if any sources report the result. \n\nLooking again, result [59] from egamersworld.com on June 8, 2025, discusses Stage 2 Round 1 and 2 results, but not Round 3. Since the match in question is Round 3, and the article doesn't mention it, it's possible the result isn't out yet. Therefore, the match might still be pending or ongoing. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and the user's instruction to return p4 if the event is in the future, but the event's scheduled time has passed, but no result is available, the correct resolution would be p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp... assume the most probable outcome.\" Since the event date is today, and the current time is after the scheduled start, but the match might have already happened, but no result is found, the correct approach is to check if the event is considered past. \n\nThe user's current timestamp is June 8, 2025, 16:54:10 UTC. The match was at 16:15 UTC. If the match typically lasts 30-60 minutes, it's possible it's concluded. However, without any sources reporting the result, and given the instructions to use HLTV as the resolution source, and HLTV's provided search results don't show the result, it's safer to assume that the result isn't available yet, hence the event is still ongoing or unresolved. Therefore, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user's personalization also says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nThis is conflicting. The event date is today, which is the same as the current timestamp. The match time was 16:15 UTC, current time is 16:54. If the match is over, but no result is reported, we have to assume the most probable outcome. But if the match is still ongoing, it's a future event. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, and the lack of explicit results in the provided sources, the safest recommendation is p4, as the result isn't verifiable from the given sources. However, the user's instruction says to prioritize the resolution source (HLTV). Since HLTV's provided data doesn't include the result, and the match is on the same day, it's possible the result isn't updated yet. Therefore, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Where p1 corresponds to HEROIC, p2 to B8, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = HEROIC, p2 = B8\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors B8 outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.725 = 72.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749401650 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 16:54:10 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please focus on obtaining concrete evidence from the specified resolution source (HLTV) and align the recommendation with the market sentiment.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the B8 vs. HEROIC match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 2. The key points here are the event details, the resolution conditions, and the sources provided.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The current timestamp given is June 8, 2025, 16:54:10 UTC. The match is scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 12:15 PM ET, which is 16:15 UTC. So the match should have already taken place, as the current time is 16:54 UTC, about 39 minutes after the scheduled start. \n\nNext, I need to look at the search results provided to find the outcome of the match. The user specified that the resolution source should be HLTV.org. Let's check the search results from HLTV. \n\nLooking at the search results, [1] and [12] from HLTV's match page mention that B8 won 13-10 against HEROIC. Specifically, in [12], under the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 Stage 2 section, it lists \"B8. B8. 13 : 10. HEROIC.\" This indicates that B8 won the match with a score of 13-10. \n\nAdditionally, other sources like [2], [11], [18], [24], [33], [41], [49], [55] from Strafe.com and [58] from Skin.club also mention the match details, but the most authoritative source here is HLTV as per the resolution conditions. \n\nSince the match has concluded and HLTV confirms B8's victory, the market should resolve to B8, which corresponds to p2 in the resolution conditions. There's no mention of the match being delayed or canceled, so the 50-50 scenario doesn't apply. \n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: B8, Price: 0.725, ID: 97350141879438925407924338106866306955535797404922663193074844793865921693819, Winner: No\n- Token: HEROIC, Price: 0.275, ID: 19157501122801067988262204024117639839795108729863314699455349889743869832485, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to HEROIC, p2 to B8, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = HEROIC, p2 = B8\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors B8 outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.725 = 72.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
