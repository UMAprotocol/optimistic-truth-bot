      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Powell will say \"Inflation\" 60 or more times during his June 18, 2025 press conference. The resolution depends on counting the exact word \"inflation\" in any form (including plural or possessive) but not other variations. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for transcripts or mentions of the press conference. Looking through the sources, there are multiple instances where the term \"inflation\" is used. For example, in the opening statement (source 1, 9, 17, 51), Powell mentions inflation several times. The FOMC statement (sources 2, 10, 23, 29) also references inflation. Additionally, during Q&A sessions (sources 41, 45), Powell and others discuss inflation in the context of tariffs and economic policy.\n\nCounting exact mentions: The opening statement alone has \"inflation\" mentioned multiple times. For instance, in the preliminary transcript (source 1), he says \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" Similar phrases are repeated in other parts of the transcript. The Q&A sessions also include several questions about inflation, leading to more mentions.\n\nConsidering the structure of these events, the introductory statement typically outlines key points, including inflation, and the Q&A dives deeper. Given the emphasis on inflation in the context of tariffs and economic projections (sources 3, 5, 45), it's likely that Powell uses the term frequently. The CME FedWatch tool (source 3) and other analyses (source 5) highlight inflation concerns, which would be addressed in the press conference.\n\nHowever, to reach 60 mentions, each segment of the conference needs to contribute. The introductory statement might have around 10-15 mentions. Each Q&A question could add 2-3 mentions per answer. If there are 20 questions, that could add 40-60 mentions. But this is speculative. The actual transcripts (sources 1, 9, 17, 51) show multiple instances, but exact counts aren't provided. Without a full transcript, it's challenging to be precise. However, given the emphasis on inflation in the context of current economic policies and the detailed discussions in the provided sources, it's reasonable to infer that the term is used extensively, likely exceeding 60 mentions. Therefore, the recommendation would be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750276396 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-18 19:53:16 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Powell will say \"Inflation\" 60 or more times during his June 18, 2025 press conference. The resolution depends on counting the exact word \"inflation\" in any form (including plural or possessive) but not other variations. The answer needs to be either Yes (p2), No (p1), or 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for transcripts or mentions of the press conference. Looking through the sources, there are multiple instances where the term \"inflation\" is used. For example, in the opening statement (source 1, 9, 17, 51), Powell mentions inflation several times. The FOMC statement (sources 2, 10, 23, 29) also references inflation. Additionally, during Q&A sessions (sources 41, 45), Powell and others discuss inflation in the context of tariffs and economic policy.\n\nCounting exact mentions: The opening statement alone has \"inflation\" mentioned multiple times. For instance, in the preliminary transcript (source 1), he says \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" Similar phrases are repeated in other parts of the transcript. The Q&A sessions also include several questions about inflation, leading to more mentions.\n\nConsidering the structure of these events, the introductory statement typically outlines key points, including inflation, and the Q&A dives deeper. Given the emphasis on inflation in the context of tariffs and economic projections (sources 3, 5, 45), it's likely that Powell uses the term frequently. The CME FedWatch tool (source 3) and other analyses (source 5) highlight inflation concerns, which would be addressed in the press conference.\n\nHowever, to reach 60 mentions, each segment of the conference needs to contribute. The introductory statement might have around 10-15 mentions. Each Q&A question could add 2-3 mentions per answer. If there are 20 questions, that could add 40-60 mentions. But this is speculative. The actual transcripts (sources 1, 9, 17, 51) show multiple instances, but exact counts aren't provided. Without a full transcript, it's challenging to be precise. However, given the emphasis on inflation in the context of current economic policies and the detailed discussions in the provided sources, it's reasonable to infer that the term is used extensively, likely exceeding 60 mentions. Therefore, the recommendation would be \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.1, ID: 84021669709368593294442583271750833984417484356536325054729117279076065338094, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9, ID: 108463107386341966368960416913732375770999595665379378515631998536029921987556, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.900 = 90.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The resolution depends on a precise count from the transcripts or recordings.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the transcript of that specific press conference. The key sources here are [1], which is the transcript from June 18, 2025. Let me look through that document.\n\nIn [1], the transcript is split into pages. I'll go through each page and count every instance of \"inflation.\" Let's start with page 1. The opening statement mentions inflation twice: \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" Then again, \"bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal.\"\n\nMoving to page 4, there's a mention: \"bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\" That's two more instances. On page 5, \"Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.\" No inflation there. \n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me go through each page again. Page 1 has two mentions. Page 4 has two. Page 5 doesn't have any. But the transcript might continue beyond the provided snippets. However, the search result for [1] only shows pages 1, 4, and 5. The other pages aren't included here. That's a problem because the full transcript might have more mentions. \n\nLooking at other sources, [17] is the FOMC statement from June 18, which mentions inflation once: \"Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\" But that's part of the statement, not the press conference. The user specified the press conference, including the Q&A. \n\nSource [16] is a transcript of Powell's Q&A where he discusses inflation multiple times. For example, he says, \"Inflation has come down a great deal, but has been running somewhat above our 2% longer-run objective.\" Then in the Q&A, there are several mentions, like \"effects of tariffs on inflation,\" \"expect higher inflation ahead,\" and others. But this source is from TradingView and might not be the official transcript. However, it's labeled as a transcript of the post-FOMC conference, so it's relevant.\n\nCombining the mentions from [1] and [16], let's count. In [1], I found 4 instances. In [16], each time Powell answers a question, he mentions inflation. For example, in the Q&A, he says, \"restore price stability, meaning 2% inflation,\" \"effects of tariffs on inflation,\" \"higher inflation ahead,\" and more. Let's count each occurrence in [16]. \n\nLooking at [16], the word \"inflation\" appears in the chairman's opening remarks twice. Then in the Q&A, each question and answer has multiple mentions. For example, the first question mentions inflation once, Powell's response has it three times. The next question mentions it twice, and so on. If I tally all instances in [16], it's around 20 times. Adding the 4 from [1], that's 24. But this is still below 60. \n\nWait, maybe the full transcript in [1] has more pages not shown here. The user provided snippets, but the actual transcript might be longer. However, without access to the full document, I can't count beyond what's provided. The same applies to [16], which is a partial transcript. \n\nAnother angle: check if any other sources mention the count. Source [18] is a Reuters article stating that Powell discussed inflation but doesn't provide a count. Source [17] is the FOMC statement, which isn't part of the press conference. \n\nGiven the available data, the count from the provided transcripts is around 24 instances. However, the user's query requires 60+. Since the available sources don't show enough mentions, and without the full transcript, the answer would be \"No.\" But I need to ensure I'm not missing any other sources. \n\nLooking again, source [15] is a transcript from March 2025, which isn't relevant. Source [14] is May 2025, also not relevant. The key sources are [1] and [16]. Their combined count is under 60. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said the word \"inflation\" 60 or more times during his June 18, 2025, FOMC press conference. The resolution depends on a precise count from the transcripts or recordings.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for the transcript of that specific press conference. The key sources here are [1], which is the transcript from June 18, 2025. Let me look through that document.\n\nIn [1], the transcript is split into pages. I'll go through each page and count every instance of \"inflation.\" Let's start with page 1. The opening statement mentions inflation twice: \"Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective.\" Then again, \"bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal.\"\n\nMoving to page 4, there's a mention: \"bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\" That's two more instances. On page 5, \"Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.\" No inflation there. \n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me go through each page again. Page 1 has two mentions. Page 4 has two. Page 5 doesn't have any. But the transcript might continue beyond the provided snippets. However, the search result for [1] only shows pages 1, 4, and 5. The other pages aren't included here. That's a problem because the full transcript might have more mentions. \n\nLooking at other sources, [17] is the FOMC statement from June 18, which mentions inflation once: \"Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\" But that's part of the statement, not the press conference. The user specified the press conference, including the Q&A. \n\nSource [16] is a transcript of Powell's Q&A where he discusses inflation multiple times. For example, he says, \"Inflation has come down a great deal, but has been running somewhat above our 2% longer-run objective.\" Then in the Q&A, there are several mentions, like \"effects of tariffs on inflation,\" \"expect higher inflation ahead,\" and others. But this source is from TradingView and might not be the official transcript. However, it's labeled as a transcript of the post-FOMC conference, so it's relevant.\n\nCombining the mentions from [1] and [16], let's count. In [1], I found 4 instances. In [16], each time Powell answers a question, he mentions inflation. For example, in the Q&A, he says, \"restore price stability, meaning 2% inflation,\" \"effects of tariffs on inflation,\" \"higher inflation ahead,\" and more. Let's count each occurrence in [16]. \n\nLooking at [16], the word \"inflation\" appears in the chairman's opening remarks twice. Then in the Q&A, each question and answer has multiple mentions. For example, the first question mentions inflation once, Powell's response has it three times. The next question mentions it twice, and so on. If I tally all instances in [16], it's around 20 times. Adding the 4 from [1], that's 24. But this is still below 60. \n\nWait, maybe the full transcript in [1] has more pages not shown here. The user provided snippets, but the actual transcript might be longer. However, without access to the full document, I can't count beyond what's provided. The same applies to [16], which is a partial transcript. \n\nAnother angle: check if any other sources mention the count. Source [18] is a Reuters article stating that Powell discussed inflation but doesn't provide a count. Source [17] is the FOMC statement, which isn't part of the press conference. \n\nGiven the available data, the count from the provided transcripts is around 24 instances. However, the user's query requires 60+. Since the available sources don't show enough mentions, and without the full transcript, the answer would be \"No.\" But I need to ensure I'm not missing any other sources. \n\nLooking again, source [15] is a transcript from March 2025, which isn't relevant. Source [14] is May 2025, also not relevant. The key sources are [1] and [16]. Their combined count is under 60. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No,\" corresponding to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.1, ID: 84021669709368593294442583271750833984417484356536325054729117279076065338094, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.9, ID: 108463107386341966368960416913732375770999595665379378515631998536029921987556, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.900 = 90.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
