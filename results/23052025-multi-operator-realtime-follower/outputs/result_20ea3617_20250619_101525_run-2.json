Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.99, ID: 103999105823088443645732052519051742238169557391155485684693873413307195065728, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.01, ID: 99949383007338329001814316121391697783512417800013446999028254426567301053420, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The close \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0C\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb and open \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0O\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets. market_id: 553176\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750327654 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_btc_price_at_specific_time(date_str, hour=5, minute=0, timezone_str=\"US/Eastern\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the BTC/USDT price for a specific time on Binance.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format (default: 5 AM)\n        minute: Minute (default: 0)\n        timezone_str: Timezone string (default: \"US/Eastern\")\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (open_price, close_price)\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching BTC/USDT price for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n    time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n    target_time_local = tz.localize(\n        datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    )\n    target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n    start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n    \n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # plus 1 hour\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            logger.info(f\"Successfully retrieved open price: {open_price} and close price: {close_price}\")\n            return (open_price, close_price)\n        else:\n            logger.error(\"No data returned from Binance API\")\n            return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to determine if the BTC price went up or down at the specified time.\n    \"\"\"\n    date_str = \"2025-06-19\"  # Date of interest\n    prices = get_btc_price_at_specific_time(date_str)\n    \n    if prices:\n        open_price, close_price = prices\n        if close_price >= open_price:\n            print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n        else:\n            print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 due to data fetch failure\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750327654 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the API call is correctly configured and that the data handling correctly parses the response. Consider adding error handling or alternative data retrieval methods if the primary API fails.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_btc_price_at_specific_time(date_str, hour=5, minute=0, timezone_str=\"US/Eastern\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches the 1-hour candle open and close price for BTC/USDT on Binance\n    at a specific time on a given date.\n\n    Args:\n        date_str: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format\n        hour: Hour in 24-hour format (default: 5 AM)\n        minute: Minute (default: 0)\n        timezone_str: Timezone string (default: \"US/Eastern\")\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (open price, close price)\n    \"\"\"\n    logger.info(f\"Fetching BTC/USDT price for {date_str} at {hour}:{minute} {timezone_str}\")\n    \n    # Convert the target time to UTC timestamp\n    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_str)\n    time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:{minute:02d}:00\"\n    target_time_local = tz.localize(\n        datetime.strptime(f\"{date_str} {time_str}\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    )\n    target_time_utc = target_time_local.astimezone(timezone.utc)\n    start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n    \n    # Binance API endpoint\n    api_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n    params = {\n        \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\",\n        \"interval\": \"1h\",\n        \"limit\": 1,\n        \"startTime\": start_time_ms,\n        \"endTime\": start_time_ms + 3600000  # plus 1 hour\n    }\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(api_url, params=params, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        \n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[0][1])\n            close_price = float(data[0][4])\n            return (open_price, close_price)\n        else:\n            logger.error(\"No data returned from Binance API\")\n            return None\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to handle the resolution of the Bitcoin price direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    date_str = \"2025-06-19\"  # Date of interest\n    prices = get_btc_price_at_specific_time(date_str)\n    \n    if prices:\n        open_price, close_price = prices\n        logger.info(f\"Open price: {open_price}, Close price: {close_price}\")\n        \n        if close_price >= open_price:\n            print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n        else:\n            print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n    else:\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 due to data retrieval failure\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p3\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.99, ID: 103999105823088443645732052519051742238169557391155485684693873413307195065728, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.01, ID: 99949383007338329001814316121391697783512417800013446999028254426567301053420, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1.

      "response": "<think>\nWe are given a query about a prediction market on whether Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) will go up or down in a specific 1-hour candle on Binance. The candle in question starts at June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET (Eastern Time). The market resolves to \"Up\" (p2) if the close price is >= the open price for that candle, and \"Down\" (p1) otherwise.\n\nKey details:\n- The event: The 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET on Binance for BTC/USDT.\n- Resolution source: Binance BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). We must use the open (O) and close (C) prices displayed at the top of the graph for the \"1H\" candle once the candle is finalized.\n- Current time: The current Unix timestamp is 1750327654, which corresponds to 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC (as per the system's current time).\n\nSteps to resolve:\n\n1. **Convert the event time to UTC:**\n   - The event starts at June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET (Eastern Time).\n   - Eastern Time (ET) can be either EST (UTC-5) or EDT (UTC-4) depending on daylight saving.\n   - On June 19, 2025, Eastern Time is observing Daylight Saving Time (EDT), which is UTC-4.\n   - Therefore, 5:00 AM EDT is 5:00 AM UTC-4, which is 9:00 AM UTC (because 5:00 AM + 4 hours = 9:00 AM UTC).\n\n2. **Check if the event has occurred:**\n   - The event candle starts at 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC and ends at 2025-06-19 10:00:00 UTC (since it's a 1-hour candle).\n   - The current time is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC, which is after the end time of the candle (10:00:00 UTC). Therefore, the candle has closed and the data should be available.\n\n3. **Retrieve the open and close prices for the candle:**\n   - We need the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC and ending at 2025-06-19 10:00:00 UTC.\n   - The resolution source is the Binance BTC/USDT trading pair page (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). However, note that the provided search results do not contain real-time data for this specific candle.\n\n4. **Challenges with the provided search results:**\n   - The search results include historical data and API documentation, but none of them provide the specific open and close prices for the candle in question (2025-06-19 09:00:00 to 10:00:00 UTC).\n   - The search result [5] (CentralCharts) shows a current price of 103,974.87 USDT as of 06/15/2025 10:57, which is not the date we need.\n   - The search result [6] (TradingView) shows a current price of 104,960 USDT, but the date is not specified and it's not for the specific candle.\n   - The search result [17] (Binance Spot) shows a price of 104,706.06, but again, without a timestamp for the specific candle.\n\n5. **Using the Binance API:**\n   - The Binance API provides kline/candlestick data. We can use the klines endpoint to get the 1-hour candle for the specified time.\n   - The endpoint for spot market is: `/api/v3/klines` (as per [2]).\n   - Parameters:\n        symbol: BTCUSDT\n        interval: 1h\n        startTime: the start time of the candle in milliseconds (Unix timestamp in milliseconds for 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC)\n        endTime: the end time of the candle in milliseconds (2025-06-19 10:00:00 UTC)\n        limit: 1\n   - The startTime in milliseconds: 1750323600000 (which is 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC in seconds: 1750323600, then multiplied by 1000).\n   - The endTime in milliseconds: 1750327200000 (2025-06-19 10:00:00 UTC: 1750327200 * 1000).\n\n6. **Current time and data availability:**\n   - The candle ended at 10:00:00 UTC and the current time is 10:07:34 UTC, so the data should be available (the candle is closed and finalized).\n\n7. **Hypothetical API call and response:**\n   - We don't have the actual API response in the search results, but we can simulate what the response would look like based on the API documentation.\n   - Example response for one candle (from [1] and [2]):\n        [\n          [\n            1750323600000,      // Open time\n            \"104000.00\",        // Open price\n            \"104500.00\",        // High\n            \"103500.00\",        // Low\n            \"104200.00\",        // Close price\n            \"1000.00000000\",    // Volume\n            1750327199999,       // Close time\n            \"104000000.00\",      // Quote asset volume\n            1000,                // Number of trades\n            \"500.00000000\",      // Taker buy base asset volume\n            \"52000000.00\",       // Taker buy quote asset volume\n            \"0\"                  // Ignore\n          ]\n        ]\n\n8. **Extracting open and close:**\n   - Open price: the second element in the array (string) -> convert to number.\n   - Close price: the fifth element in the array (string) -> convert to number.\n\n9. **Resolution:**\n   - If close >= open, then resolve to \"Up\" (p2).\n   - Else, resolve to \"Down\" (p1).\n\n10. **Problem: We don't have the actual data.**\n    - The search results do not contain the actual price for the specific candle. We must rely on the Binance page or API.\n\n11. **Alternative: Using the Binance web page.**\n    - The resolution source is the Binance page. We are instructed to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle.\n    - However, the provided search results do not include a snapshot of that page at the required time.\n\n12. **Conclusion given the constraints:**\n    - Since we don't have the actual data in the search results, and the event has occurred (the candle is closed), we must assume that the data is available on Binance.\n    - However, without the actual numbers, we cannot compute the exact open and close.\n\n13. **But note: The system prompt says:**\n    - \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\n    However, we cannot assume an outcome without data. The event has occurred, but we don't have the data. Therefore, we must return p4 (cannot be resolved at this time) because we lack the verifiable information.\n\n    But wait: the event has occurred and the data should be available. We are expected to use the Binance source. Since we don't have it in the context, we cannot verify.\n\n    However, note the instruction: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user prompt does contain a URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT. But the search results do not include the content of that page for the specific candle.\n\n    Therefore, we must conclude that we do not have the required data to resolve.\n\n14. **Final decision:**\n    - We cannot resolve without the data. We return p4.\n\nHowever, let's reexamine: the system prompt also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" But what is the most probable outcome? We don't have any basis to assume up or down. The ancillary data does not provide a default.\n\nBut note: the ancillary data says: \"p3: 0.5\" for unknown/50-50. However, the resolution conditions say: \"p3: 0.5\" meaning 50-50. But the market is designed to resolve to p1 or p2. The p3 is for unknown. So in the absence of data, we should use p3? But the resolution conditions in the ancillary data are: \"res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5\". And the system prompt says: \"If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nWe don't have any information to infer. Therefore, we must use p4.\n\nBut note: the system prompt says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nWhat is the most probable outcome? We don't have any data to determine probability. Therefore, we cannot assume. The safe choice is p4.\n\nHowever, the system prompt also says: \"If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\" We have no information, so we default to p4.\n\nBut wait: the event has occurred and the data is available on Binance. We are just not provided with it in the search results. Therefore, we must rely on the search results we have. Since we don't have the data, we cannot resolve.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p4.\n\nHowever, let's check the current price in the search results to see if we can infer? But note: the event is for a specific candle that has already closed. We have the current time after the candle, but we don't have the open and close of that candle.\n\nIn the search results, we have:\n- [5]: CentralCharts: data as of 06/15/2025, which is before the event.\n- [6]: TradingView: current price of 104,960 USDT, but without a timestamp. However, the system time is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC, which is after the candle (which ended at 10:00:00 UTC). The TradingView page might show the current price, but not the open and close of the specific candle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use that.\n\nConclusion: We do not have the required data to resolve the market. We must return p4.\n\nBut note: the system prompt says: \"If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.\" This is not a video.\n\nFinal recommendation: p4.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the event time conversion:\n\n- 5:00 AM ET (Eastern Time) on June 19, 2025, is 9:00 AM UTC (because ET is EDT, UTC-4).\n- The candle: 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM UTC.\n- Current time: 10:07:34 UTC -> the candle is closed.\n\nBut without the data, we cannot know the open and close.\n\nTherefore:\n\nrecommendation: p4\n</think>\n### Analysis of Bitcoin Price Movement for June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET\n\nThe query requires determining whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET closed higher or lower than its open price, using Binance as the resolution source. Key steps in the analysis:\n\n1. **Time Conversion**:  \n   - 5:00 AM ET (Eastern Time) corresponds to 9:00 AM UTC, as Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is UTC-4[7][18].  \n   - The candle spans 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\n2. **Data Availability**:  \n   - Binance provides finalized candle data via its API endpoints[1][2][3], with open (O) and close (C) prices as primary resolution metrics.  \n   - The current timestamp (2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC)[9][14] confirms the candle has closed (10:00 AM UTC), making data available.\n\n3. **Price Verification**:  \n   - Binance's kline/candlestick API returns arrays containing open/close prices[1][2][8]. For example:  \n     - Open: First value after the timestamp.  \n     - Close: Fifth value in the array.  \n   - No real-time price for the specific candle is found in the search results[5][6][17], as they display aggregate or outdated data.\n\n4. **Resolution Logic**:  \n   - If \\( C \\geq O \\), resolve to \"Up\" (p2).  \n   - If \\( C < O \\), resolve to \"Down\" (p1).  \n   - Absent verifiable data for this exact candle, resolution defaults to p4 per ancillary rules[personalization].\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe event occurred in the past, but the provided search results lack explicit open/close prices for the 9:00\u201310:00 AM UTC candle. Binance's API would supply this, but without direct access to the finalized data in this context, the outcome cannot be verified.  \n\n**Recommendation**: p4  \n\n**Final Resolution**:  \nThe market cannot be resolved due to insufficient verifiable data.  \n\nrecommendation: p4",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750327654 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about a prediction market on whether Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) will go up or down in a specific 1-hour candle on Binance. The candle in question starts at June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET (Eastern Time). The market resolves to \"Up\" (p2) if the close price is >= the open price for that candle, and \"Down\" (p1) otherwise.\n\nKey details:\n- The event: The 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET on Binance for BTC/USDT.\n- Resolution source: Binance BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). We must use the open (O) and close (C) prices displayed at the top of the graph for the \"1H\" candle once the candle is finalized.\n- Current time: The current Unix timestamp is 1750327654, which corresponds to 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC (as per the system's current time).\n\nSteps to resolve:\n\n1. **Convert the event time to UTC:**\n   - The event starts at June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET (Eastern Time).\n   - Eastern Time (ET) can be either EST (UTC-5) or EDT (UTC-4) depending on daylight saving.\n   - On June 19, 2025, Eastern Time is observing Daylight Saving Time (EDT), which is UTC-4.\n   - Therefore, 5:00 AM EDT is 5:00 AM UTC-4, which is 9:00 AM UTC (because 5:00 AM + 4 hours = 9:00 AM UTC).\n\n2. **Check if the event has occurred:**\n   - The event candle starts at 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC and ends at 2025-06-19 10:00:00 UTC (since it's a 1-hour candle).\n   - The current time is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC, which is after the end time of the candle (10:00:00 UTC). Therefore, the candle has closed and the data should be available.\n\n3. **Retrieve the open and close prices for the candle:**\n   - We need the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC and ending at 2025-06-19 10:00:00 UTC.\n   - The resolution source is the Binance BTC/USDT trading pair page (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). However, note that the provided search results do not contain real-time data for this specific candle.\n\n4. **Challenges with the provided search results:**\n   - The search results include historical data and API documentation, but none of them provide the specific open and close prices for the candle in question (2025-06-19 09:00:00 to 10:00:00 UTC).\n   - The search result [5] (CentralCharts) shows a current price of 103,974.87 USDT as of 06/15/2025 10:57, which is not the date we need.\n   - The search result [6] (TradingView) shows a current price of 104,960 USDT, but the date is not specified and it's not for the specific candle.\n   - The search result [17] (Binance Spot) shows a price of 104,706.06, but again, without a timestamp for the specific candle.\n\n5. **Using the Binance API:**\n   - The Binance API provides kline/candlestick data. We can use the klines endpoint to get the 1-hour candle for the specified time.\n   - The endpoint for spot market is: `/api/v3/klines` (as per [2]).\n   - Parameters:\n        symbol: BTCUSDT\n        interval: 1h\n        startTime: the start time of the candle in milliseconds (Unix timestamp in milliseconds for 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC)\n        endTime: the end time of the candle in milliseconds (2025-06-19 10:00:00 UTC)\n        limit: 1\n   - The startTime in milliseconds: 1750323600000 (which is 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC in seconds: 1750323600, then multiplied by 1000).\n   - The endTime in milliseconds: 1750327200000 (2025-06-19 10:00:00 UTC: 1750327200 * 1000).\n\n6. **Current time and data availability:**\n   - The candle ended at 10:00:00 UTC and the current time is 10:07:34 UTC, so the data should be available (the candle is closed and finalized).\n\n7. **Hypothetical API call and response:**\n   - We don't have the actual API response in the search results, but we can simulate what the response would look like based on the API documentation.\n   - Example response for one candle (from [1] and [2]):\n        [\n          [\n            1750323600000,      // Open time\n            \"104000.00\",        // Open price\n            \"104500.00\",        // High\n            \"103500.00\",        // Low\n            \"104200.00\",        // Close price\n            \"1000.00000000\",    // Volume\n            1750327199999,       // Close time\n            \"104000000.00\",      // Quote asset volume\n            1000,                // Number of trades\n            \"500.00000000\",      // Taker buy base asset volume\n            \"52000000.00\",       // Taker buy quote asset volume\n            \"0\"                  // Ignore\n          ]\n        ]\n\n8. **Extracting open and close:**\n   - Open price: the second element in the array (string) -> convert to number.\n   - Close price: the fifth element in the array (string) -> convert to number.\n\n9. **Resolution:**\n   - If close >= open, then resolve to \"Up\" (p2).\n   - Else, resolve to \"Down\" (p1).\n\n10. **Problem: We don't have the actual data.**\n    - The search results do not contain the actual price for the specific candle. We must rely on the Binance page or API.\n\n11. **Alternative: Using the Binance web page.**\n    - The resolution source is the Binance page. We are instructed to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle.\n    - However, the provided search results do not include a snapshot of that page at the required time.\n\n12. **Conclusion given the constraints:**\n    - Since we don't have the actual data in the search results, and the event has occurred (the candle is closed), we must assume that the data is available on Binance.\n    - However, without the actual numbers, we cannot compute the exact open and close.\n\n13. **But note: The system prompt says:**\n    - \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\n    However, we cannot assume an outcome without data. The event has occurred, but we don't have the data. Therefore, we must return p4 (cannot be resolved at this time) because we lack the verifiable information.\n\n    But wait: the event has occurred and the data should be available. We are expected to use the Binance source. Since we don't have it in the context, we cannot verify.\n\n    However, note the instruction: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user prompt does contain a URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT. But the search results do not include the content of that page for the specific candle.\n\n    Therefore, we must conclude that we do not have the required data to resolve.\n\n14. **Final decision:**\n    - We cannot resolve without the data. We return p4.\n\nHowever, let's reexamine: the system prompt also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" But what is the most probable outcome? We don't have any basis to assume up or down. The ancillary data does not provide a default.\n\nBut note: the ancillary data says: \"p3: 0.5\" for unknown/50-50. However, the resolution conditions say: \"p3: 0.5\" meaning 50-50. But the market is designed to resolve to p1 or p2. The p3 is for unknown. So in the absence of data, we should use p3? But the resolution conditions in the ancillary data are: \"res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5\". And the system prompt says: \"If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nWe don't have any information to infer. Therefore, we must use p4.\n\nBut note: the system prompt says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nWhat is the most probable outcome? We don't have any data to determine probability. Therefore, we cannot assume. The safe choice is p4.\n\nHowever, the system prompt also says: \"If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\" We have no information, so we default to p4.\n\nBut wait: the event has occurred and the data is available on Binance. We are just not provided with it in the search results. Therefore, we must rely on the search results we have. Since we don't have the data, we cannot resolve.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p4.\n\nHowever, let's check the current price in the search results to see if we can infer? But note: the event is for a specific candle that has already closed. We have the current time after the candle, but we don't have the open and close of that candle.\n\nIn the search results, we have:\n- [5]: CentralCharts: data as of 06/15/2025, which is before the event.\n- [6]: TradingView: current price of 104,960 USDT, but without a timestamp. However, the system time is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC, which is after the candle (which ended at 10:00:00 UTC). The TradingView page might show the current price, but not the open and close of the specific candle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use that.\n\nConclusion: We do not have the required data to resolve the market. We must return p4.\n\nBut note: the system prompt says: \"If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.\" This is not a video.\n\nFinal recommendation: p4.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the event time conversion:\n\n- 5:00 AM ET (Eastern Time) on June 19, 2025, is 9:00 AM UTC (because ET is EDT, UTC-4).\n- The candle: 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM UTC.\n- Current time: 10:07:34 UTC -> the candle is closed.\n\nBut without the data, we cannot know the open and close.\n\nTherefore:\n\nrecommendation: p4\n</think>\n### Analysis of Bitcoin Price Movement for June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET\n\nThe query requires determining whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET closed higher or lower than its open price, using Binance as the resolution source. Key steps in the analysis:\n\n1. **Time Conversion**:  \n   - 5:00 AM ET (Eastern Time) corresponds to 9:00 AM UTC, as Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) is UTC-4[7][18].  \n   - The candle spans 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\n2. **Data Availability**:  \n   - Binance provides finalized candle data via its API endpoints[1][2][3], with open (O) and close (C) prices as primary resolution metrics.  \n   - The current timestamp (2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC)[9][14] confirms the candle has closed (10:00 AM UTC), making data available.\n\n3. **Price Verification**:  \n   - Binance's kline/candlestick API returns arrays containing open/close prices[1][2][8]. For example:  \n     - Open: First value after the timestamp.  \n     - Close: Fifth value in the array.  \n   - No real-time price for the specific candle is found in the search results[5][6][17], as they display aggregate or outdated data.\n\n4. **Resolution Logic**:  \n   - If \\( C \\geq O \\), resolve to \"Up\" (p2).  \n   - If \\( C < O \\), resolve to \"Down\" (p1).  \n   - Absent verifiable data for this exact candle, resolution defaults to p4 per ancillary rules[personalization].\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe event occurred in the past, but the provided search results lack explicit open/close prices for the 9:00\u201310:00 AM UTC candle. Binance's API would supply this, but without direct access to the finalized data in this context, the outcome cannot be verified.  \n\n**Recommendation**: p4  \n\n**Final Resolution**:  \nThe market cannot be resolved due to insufficient verifiable data.  \n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.99, ID: 103999105823088443645732052519051742238169557391155485684693873413307195065728, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.01, ID: 99949383007338329001814316121391697783512417800013446999028254426567301053420, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The market resolves to \"Up\" if the close price is >= the open price, and \"Down\" otherwise. The data source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair.\n\nThe current time is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC (as per the Unix timestamp 1750327654). The candle in question (starting at 2025-06-19 09:00 UTC) would have ended at 2025-06-19 10:00 UTC. Since the current time is 10:07:34 UTC, the candle has closed and the data should be available.\n\nWe have search results that include:\n- Binance API documentation for kline/candlestick data [1][2][3][4]\n- Historical datasets [5][9][18][35][60]\n- Real-time price data and charts [6][11][30][32][33][36][37][57][58][61][62]\n- Tools for converting timestamps and timezones [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][63][64][65][66][67][68][69]\n\nHowever, we need the specific open and close prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 2025-06-19 09:00 UTC (which is the same as 2025-06-19 05:00 AM ET, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time).\n\nFrom the search results, we see that Binance provides kline/candlestick data via their API. The endpoint for klines is `/api/v3/klines` for the spot market [2]. The parameters include:\n- symbol: BTCUSDT\n- interval: 1h\n- startTime: optional, but we can specify the start time of the candle in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.\n\nThe candle we are interested in started at 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC. We can convert this to a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.\n\nFirst, convert the date to a Unix timestamp in seconds:\n  2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC\nUsing a timestamp converter (as in [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][63][64][65][66][67][68][69]), we can calculate:\n\nWe know the current time is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC, which is Unix timestamp 1750327654 seconds.\n\nThe candle start time: 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC is 1 hour and 7 minutes and 34 seconds before the current time. So:\n  1750327654 - (1*3600 + 7*60 + 34) = 1750327654 - (3600+420+34) = 1750327654 - 4054 = 1750323600 seconds.\n\nSo the start time in seconds is 1750323600, and in milliseconds: 1750323600000.\n\nWe can use the Binance API to get the kline for that hour. However, we don't have direct API access, but we have search results that might have the data or real-time data.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n- [6] CoinMarketCap shows the BTC to USDT rate history for June 19, 2025: 105,109.67 USDT (with 0.24% change). But this is daily data, not hourly.\n- [11] TradingView's BTCUSDT chart shows the current price and historical data, but we don't have the exact open and close for the 9:00-10:00 UTC candle.\n- [33] and [58] are live price charts for BTC/USDT on Binance, but they show the current price and recent news, not the specific candle.\n\nWe also have [35][60] which are historical datasets on Kaggle, but we cannot access them in real-time.\n\nHowever, we have [6] which is from CoinMarketCap and shows the daily closing prices, but we need hourly.\n\nAnother approach: we have the current time and the candle has closed. We can look for the most recent hourly data in the search results.\n\nIn [33] (Coinalyze) and [58] (Coinalyze for perpetual) we see news and discussions, but not the specific candle.\n\nBut we have [6] which is CoinMarketCap and it shows the BTC to USDT rate for June 19, 2025: 105,109.67 USDT. However, that is the daily close (at 00:00 UTC). We need the hourly candle.\n\nWe also have [30] which is the Binance spot trading page for BTC/USDT. It would show the current price and the chart. But we don't have a snapshot.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must rely on the available data in the search results.\n\nLooking at [6] again, it says:\n  \"The BTC to USDT conversion rate today is 104,716.61 USDT. This is a decrease of 0.21% in the last hour and a decrease of 1.42% in the last 24 hours.\"\n\nBut this is as of the time of the search result (which is not specified, but the page was likely crawled at a certain time). We don't know if this is at 10:00 UTC.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the historical data from the Binance API via the provided datasets. But we don't have the exact data point.\n\nWe have [16] which is CryptoDataDownload, and they provide historical data. But we don't have the specific file.\n\nGiven the time constraints, we must use the available information.\n\nAnother idea: the search result [6] has a table of the last week's daily closing prices. But we need hourly.\n\nWe have [33] which is Coinalyze for the perpetual contract, and it has a live chart. But we don't have the exact value.\n\nBut note: the query says the resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, and the data is taken from the top of the graph for the 1H candle.\n\nWe have a search result [30] (Binance trade page) but it doesn't show the historical candle.\n\nHowever, we have [61] (TradingView) which shows the BTCUSDT chart. The current price is 104,960 USDT (as per [61]). But we need the open and close for 9:00-10:00 UTC.\n\nGiven that the candle has closed (at 10:00 UTC) and the current time is 10:07 UTC, we can assume that the data is available. But we don't have it in the search results.\n\nWe must look for the most recent hourly data in the search results.\n\nIn [33] (Coinalyze) we see news from June 19, 2025, at 09:00 and 10:00, but no price.\n\nBut we have [6] which says the current price is 104,716.61 USDT (as of the time of the page). However, we don't know when that page was crawled.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API through the provided documentation. We can simulate the API call.\n\nBut we don't have the actual data. We must rely on the search results.\n\nLooking at [6] (CoinMarketCap) again, it says:\n  \"Jun 19, 2025: 105,109.67 USDT, 0.24%\"\n\nBut that is the daily close? Actually, the table says \"These historic prices are taken at the daily closing at 00:00 (UTC+0).\" So that is the price at the end of the day (00:00 UTC of the next day). Not helpful for our hourly candle.\n\nWe need to find a source that provides the hourly candle.\n\nIn the search results, we have [35] and [60] which are Kaggle datasets that include hourly data. But we don't have the specific file.\n\nGiven the challenge, we must look for the most recent price in the search results.\n\nIn [33] (Coinalyze) we see:\n  \"Bitcoin fell 6% amid Israel-Iran tensions, but ETF inflows helped stabilize the market. ...\"\n  and the time of the news is June 19, 2025 09:00.\n\nBut we don't have the price.\n\nAnother result: [58] (Coinalyze for perpetual) has a news item at June 19, 2025 07:24: \"The post Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Today (19th June, 2025) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ...\". But again, no price.\n\nWe have [62] (Binance price page) which says:\n  \"1 Bitcoin currently costs $104933.58, up 0.31% in the last 24h.\"\n\nBut this is the current price as of the time of the page, not the hourly open and close.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data in the search results for the exact candle, we must rely on the fact that the candle has closed and the data is available on Binance. Since we don't have the actual numbers, we cannot definitively say whether it was up or down.\n\nHowever, the personalization section says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nBut we do have verifiable information available on Binance, just not in the search results. We are instructed to use the provided search results.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the current price and the trend to infer. But that is not reliable.\n\nAnother idea: we have [6] which says the price in the last hour decreased by 0.21%. That suggests that the close was lower than the open? But we don't know the exact open and close.\n\nLet me parse [6] more carefully:\n  \"The BTC to USDT conversion rate today is 104,716.61 USDT. This is a decrease of 0.21% in the last hour and a decrease of 1.42% in the last 24 hours.\"\n\nThis implies that in the last hour (which would be from 9:07 to 10:07, not our candle from 9:00 to 10:00) the price decreased by 0.21%. But our candle is from 9:00 to 10:00.\n\nWe don't have the data.\n\nGiven the instructions, if we cannot find the data in the search results, we must answer as best as we can.\n\nBut note: the personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt does not contain a URL, but the ancillary data specifies the source as Binance (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). However, we don't have a snapshot of that page at the required time.\n\nWe have to rely on the search results.\n\nLooking at [30] (Binance trade page) but it doesn't show the historical candle.\n\nGiven the time, we must make a decision.\n\nAlternative approach: we can calculate the open and close using the current time and the price movement. But we don't have the open.\n\nWe have the current price (from multiple sources) around 104,700-105,000. But we don't have the price at 9:00 and 10:00.\n\nWe must conclude that the data is not available in the search results. Therefore, we cannot verify the outcome.\n\nBut the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data says: p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5 (unknown).\n\nSince we don't have the data, we should return p3 (unknown). But the personalization also says: \"If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. p4 is not defined in the ancillary data. The ancillary data says: \"res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5\". So p3 is for unknown.\n\nBut the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. The event is in the past.\n\nSo we should return p3.\n\nHowever, let's reexamine: the candle is from 9:00 to 10:00 UTC, and the current time is 10:07 UTC. The candle has closed. The data is available on Binance, but not in our search results. We are instructed to use the provided search results.\n\nTherefore, since we cannot find the open and close in the search results, we must return p3.\n\nBut wait, the personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.\" There are no updates.\n\nSo the recommendation is p3.\n\nHowever, we have one more idea: the search result [33] has a table of the last 24 hours for BTC/USDT on Binance? No, it's news.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the price at the beginning of the hour and the end of the hour from the available data.\n\nWe have [6] which says the price at the time of the page was 104,716.61 and it decreased 0.21% in the last hour. But that doesn't give us the open and close for the specific candle.\n\nGiven the above, I think we have to return p3.\n\nBut let's check the current price and the price an hour ago from the search results.\n\nIn [6] (CoinMarketCap) it says the price at Jun 19, 2025 is 105,109.67 USDT (which is the daily close at 00:00 UTC). That's not helpful.\n\nIn [11] (TradingView) it says the current price is 104,960 USDT. But we don't have the price at 9:00 and 10:00.\n\nWe have to conclude that the data is not available in the search results.\n\nTherefore, the resolution is unknown (p3).\n\nBut note: the personalization says: \"If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\" But p4 is for when the event is in the future. The event is in the past, so we should use p3.\n\nSo the recommendation is p3.\n\nBut let's double-check the time: the candle is from 9:00 to 10:00 UTC. The current time is 10:07 UTC. The candle is closed. The data is available on Binance, but not in our search results. We are to use the search results.\n\nTherefore, we return p3.\n\nHowever, the previous response (as per the personalization) returned p4. We are to try again with a different approach.\n\nWe must find the data in the search results.\n\nLooking at [35] and [60] (Kaggle datasets) we don't have the specific data point.\n\nBut we have [16] (CryptoDataDownload) which provides historical data. We don't have the exact file, but we have a link to their data. However, we don't have the data for June 19, 2025 at 9:00-10:00.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must use the available information.\n\nAnother search result: [6] has a table of daily closes, but not hourly.\n\nWe have to accept that the data is not in the search results. Therefore, we return p3.\n\nBut the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe most probable outcome? We don't have any information to determine probability. So we should use p3 (unknown).\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p3.\n\nBut note: the ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, which is for unknown/50-50.\n\nSo we return p3.\n\nHowever, the previous response returned p4, which is for future events. We are to try again. We are now returning p3.\n\nSo the final recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) 1-Hour Candle for June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET (9:00 AM UTC)\n\nThe market resolution depends on the 1-hour BTC/USDT candle starting at June 19, 2025, 9:00 AM UTC (equivalent to 5:00 AM ET). The outcome is determined as follows:\n- **Up (p2)**: Close price \u2265 Open price\n- **Down (p1)**: Close price < Open price\n- **Unknown (p3)**: Insufficient verifiable data\n\n#### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Time Context**:  \n   The query timestamp is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC. The candle period (9:00\u201310:00 UTC) concluded at 10:00 UTC, placing the event in the past.  \n2. **Data Availability**:  \n   Binance provides finalized candle data via its API and web interface post-closure. The open (O) and close (C) values for the 1-hour candle should be accessible through:\n   - Binance's BTC/USDT trading page (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT)\n   - Historical kline/candlestick APIs ([1][2][3][12])\n3. **Search Result Limitations**:  \n   No explicit open/close values for the 9:00\u201310:00 UTC candle appear in the provided search results. Sources like CoinMarketCap [6][11], TradingView [33][58][61], and Coinalyze [36][37] offer aggregate or real-time data but lack the specific candle breakdown.\n4. **Ancillary Data Directive**:  \n   Per resolution conditions:\n   - p1 (Down) = 0\n   - p2 (Up) = 1\n   - p3 (Unknown) = 0.5  \n   If verifiable data is unavailable despite the event occurring in the past, resolution defaults to p3.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nNo verifiable open/close prices for the specified candle were found in the search results. While Binance's systems store this data, it is not retrievable from the provided context. Per the ancillary data protocol, the outcome defaults to **p3 (Unknown)** due to unverified information.\n\n**recommendation: p3**",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750327654 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about resolving a market on whether Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) went \"Up\" or \"Down\" for the 1-hour candle starting at June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET (which is 9:00 AM UTC). The market resolves to \"Up\" if the close price is >= the open price, and \"Down\" otherwise. The data source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair.\n\nThe current time is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC (as per the Unix timestamp 1750327654). The candle in question (starting at 2025-06-19 09:00 UTC) would have ended at 2025-06-19 10:00 UTC. Since the current time is 10:07:34 UTC, the candle has closed and the data should be available.\n\nWe have search results that include:\n- Binance API documentation for kline/candlestick data [1][2][3][4]\n- Historical datasets [5][9][18][35][60]\n- Real-time price data and charts [6][11][30][32][33][36][37][57][58][61][62]\n- Tools for converting timestamps and timezones [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][63][64][65][66][67][68][69]\n\nHowever, we need the specific open and close prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 2025-06-19 09:00 UTC (which is the same as 2025-06-19 05:00 AM ET, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time).\n\nFrom the search results, we see that Binance provides kline/candlestick data via their API. The endpoint for klines is `/api/v3/klines` for the spot market [2]. The parameters include:\n- symbol: BTCUSDT\n- interval: 1h\n- startTime: optional, but we can specify the start time of the candle in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.\n\nThe candle we are interested in started at 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC. We can convert this to a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.\n\nFirst, convert the date to a Unix timestamp in seconds:\n  2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC\nUsing a timestamp converter (as in [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][63][64][65][66][67][68][69]), we can calculate:\n\nWe know the current time is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC, which is Unix timestamp 1750327654 seconds.\n\nThe candle start time: 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC is 1 hour and 7 minutes and 34 seconds before the current time. So:\n  1750327654 - (1*3600 + 7*60 + 34) = 1750327654 - (3600+420+34) = 1750327654 - 4054 = 1750323600 seconds.\n\nSo the start time in seconds is 1750323600, and in milliseconds: 1750323600000.\n\nWe can use the Binance API to get the kline for that hour. However, we don't have direct API access, but we have search results that might have the data or real-time data.\n\nLooking at the search results, we have:\n- [6] CoinMarketCap shows the BTC to USDT rate history for June 19, 2025: 105,109.67 USDT (with 0.24% change). But this is daily data, not hourly.\n- [11] TradingView's BTCUSDT chart shows the current price and historical data, but we don't have the exact open and close for the 9:00-10:00 UTC candle.\n- [33] and [58] are live price charts for BTC/USDT on Binance, but they show the current price and recent news, not the specific candle.\n\nWe also have [35][60] which are historical datasets on Kaggle, but we cannot access them in real-time.\n\nHowever, we have [6] which is from CoinMarketCap and shows the daily closing prices, but we need hourly.\n\nAnother approach: we have the current time and the candle has closed. We can look for the most recent hourly data in the search results.\n\nIn [33] (Coinalyze) and [58] (Coinalyze for perpetual) we see news and discussions, but not the specific candle.\n\nBut we have [6] which is CoinMarketCap and it shows the BTC to USDT rate for June 19, 2025: 105,109.67 USDT. However, that is the daily close (at 00:00 UTC). We need the hourly candle.\n\nWe also have [30] which is the Binance spot trading page for BTC/USDT. It would show the current price and the chart. But we don't have a snapshot.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must rely on the available data in the search results.\n\nLooking at [6] again, it says:\n  \"The BTC to USDT conversion rate today is 104,716.61 USDT. This is a decrease of 0.21% in the last hour and a decrease of 1.42% in the last 24 hours.\"\n\nBut this is as of the time of the search result (which is not specified, but the page was likely crawled at a certain time). We don't know if this is at 10:00 UTC.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the historical data from the Binance API via the provided datasets. But we don't have the exact data point.\n\nWe have [16] which is CryptoDataDownload, and they provide historical data. But we don't have the specific file.\n\nGiven the time constraints, we must use the available information.\n\nAnother idea: the search result [6] has a table of the last week's daily closing prices. But we need hourly.\n\nWe have [33] which is Coinalyze for the perpetual contract, and it has a live chart. But we don't have the exact value.\n\nBut note: the query says the resolution source is Binance's BTC/USDT pair, and the data is taken from the top of the graph for the 1H candle.\n\nWe have a search result [30] (Binance trade page) but it doesn't show the historical candle.\n\nHowever, we have [61] (TradingView) which shows the BTCUSDT chart. The current price is 104,960 USDT (as per [61]). But we need the open and close for 9:00-10:00 UTC.\n\nGiven that the candle has closed (at 10:00 UTC) and the current time is 10:07 UTC, we can assume that the data is available. But we don't have it in the search results.\n\nWe must look for the most recent hourly data in the search results.\n\nIn [33] (Coinalyze) we see news from June 19, 2025, at 09:00 and 10:00, but no price.\n\nBut we have [6] which says the current price is 104,716.61 USDT (as of the time of the page). However, we don't know when that page was crawled.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API through the provided documentation. We can simulate the API call.\n\nBut we don't have the actual data. We must rely on the search results.\n\nLooking at [6] (CoinMarketCap) again, it says:\n  \"Jun 19, 2025: 105,109.67 USDT, 0.24%\"\n\nBut that is the daily close? Actually, the table says \"These historic prices are taken at the daily closing at 00:00 (UTC+0).\" So that is the price at the end of the day (00:00 UTC of the next day). Not helpful for our hourly candle.\n\nWe need to find a source that provides the hourly candle.\n\nIn the search results, we have [35] and [60] which are Kaggle datasets that include hourly data. But we don't have the specific file.\n\nGiven the challenge, we must look for the most recent price in the search results.\n\nIn [33] (Coinalyze) we see:\n  \"Bitcoin fell 6% amid Israel-Iran tensions, but ETF inflows helped stabilize the market. ...\"\n  and the time of the news is June 19, 2025 09:00.\n\nBut we don't have the price.\n\nAnother result: [58] (Coinalyze for perpetual) has a news item at June 19, 2025 07:24: \"The post Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Today (19th June, 2025) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ...\". But again, no price.\n\nWe have [62] (Binance price page) which says:\n  \"1 Bitcoin currently costs $104933.58, up 0.31% in the last 24h.\"\n\nBut this is the current price as of the time of the page, not the hourly open and close.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data in the search results for the exact candle, we must rely on the fact that the candle has closed and the data is available on Binance. Since we don't have the actual numbers, we cannot definitively say whether it was up or down.\n\nHowever, the personalization section says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nBut we do have verifiable information available on Binance, just not in the search results. We are instructed to use the provided search results.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the current price and the trend to infer. But that is not reliable.\n\nAnother idea: we have [6] which says the price in the last hour decreased by 0.21%. That suggests that the close was lower than the open? But we don't know the exact open and close.\n\nLet me parse [6] more carefully:\n  \"The BTC to USDT conversion rate today is 104,716.61 USDT. This is a decrease of 0.21% in the last hour and a decrease of 1.42% in the last 24 hours.\"\n\nThis implies that in the last hour (which would be from 9:07 to 10:07, not our candle from 9:00 to 10:00) the price decreased by 0.21%. But our candle is from 9:00 to 10:00.\n\nWe don't have the data.\n\nGiven the instructions, if we cannot find the data in the search results, we must answer as best as we can.\n\nBut note: the personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt does not contain a URL, but the ancillary data specifies the source as Binance (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). However, we don't have a snapshot of that page at the required time.\n\nWe have to rely on the search results.\n\nLooking at [30] (Binance trade page) but it doesn't show the historical candle.\n\nGiven the time, we must make a decision.\n\nAlternative approach: we can calculate the open and close using the current time and the price movement. But we don't have the open.\n\nWe have the current price (from multiple sources) around 104,700-105,000. But we don't have the price at 9:00 and 10:00.\n\nWe must conclude that the data is not available in the search results. Therefore, we cannot verify the outcome.\n\nBut the personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data says: p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: 0.5 (unknown).\n\nSince we don't have the data, we should return p3 (unknown). But the personalization also says: \"If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\"\n\nWait, the resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. p4 is not defined in the ancillary data. The ancillary data says: \"res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5\". So p3 is for unknown.\n\nBut the personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. The event is in the past.\n\nSo we should return p3.\n\nHowever, let's reexamine: the candle is from 9:00 to 10:00 UTC, and the current time is 10:07 UTC. The candle has closed. The data is available on Binance, but not in our search results. We are instructed to use the provided search results.\n\nTherefore, since we cannot find the open and close in the search results, we must return p3.\n\nBut wait, the personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.\" There are no updates.\n\nSo the recommendation is p3.\n\nHowever, we have one more idea: the search result [33] has a table of the last 24 hours for BTC/USDT on Binance? No, it's news.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the price at the beginning of the hour and the end of the hour from the available data.\n\nWe have [6] which says the price at the time of the page was 104,716.61 and it decreased 0.21% in the last hour. But that doesn't give us the open and close for the specific candle.\n\nGiven the above, I think we have to return p3.\n\nBut let's check the current price and the price an hour ago from the search results.\n\nIn [6] (CoinMarketCap) it says the price at Jun 19, 2025 is 105,109.67 USDT (which is the daily close at 00:00 UTC). That's not helpful.\n\nIn [11] (TradingView) it says the current price is 104,960 USDT. But we don't have the price at 9:00 and 10:00.\n\nWe have to conclude that the data is not available in the search results.\n\nTherefore, the resolution is unknown (p3).\n\nBut note: the personalization says: \"If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.\" But p4 is for when the event is in the future. The event is in the past, so we should use p3.\n\nSo the recommendation is p3.\n\nBut let's double-check the time: the candle is from 9:00 to 10:00 UTC. The current time is 10:07 UTC. The candle is closed. The data is available on Binance, but not in our search results. We are to use the search results.\n\nTherefore, we return p3.\n\nHowever, the previous response (as per the personalization) returned p4. We are to try again with a different approach.\n\nWe must find the data in the search results.\n\nLooking at [35] and [60] (Kaggle datasets) we don't have the specific data point.\n\nBut we have [16] (CryptoDataDownload) which provides historical data. We don't have the exact file, but we have a link to their data. However, we don't have the data for June 19, 2025 at 9:00-10:00.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must use the available information.\n\nAnother search result: [6] has a table of daily closes, but not hourly.\n\nWe have to accept that the data is not in the search results. Therefore, we return p3.\n\nBut the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe most probable outcome? We don't have any information to determine probability. So we should use p3 (unknown).\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p3.\n\nBut note: the ancillary data says p3 is 0.5, which is for unknown/50-50.\n\nSo we return p3.\n\nHowever, the previous response returned p4, which is for future events. We are to try again. We are now returning p3.\n\nSo the final recommendation is p3.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Bitcoin (BTC/USDT) 1-Hour Candle for June 19, 2025, 5:00 AM ET (9:00 AM UTC)\n\nThe market resolution depends on the 1-hour BTC/USDT candle starting at June 19, 2025, 9:00 AM UTC (equivalent to 5:00 AM ET). The outcome is determined as follows:\n- **Up (p2)**: Close price \u2265 Open price\n- **Down (p1)**: Close price < Open price\n- **Unknown (p3)**: Insufficient verifiable data\n\n#### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Time Context**:  \n   The query timestamp is 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC. The candle period (9:00\u201310:00 UTC) concluded at 10:00 UTC, placing the event in the past.  \n2. **Data Availability**:  \n   Binance provides finalized candle data via its API and web interface post-closure. The open (O) and close (C) values for the 1-hour candle should be accessible through:\n   - Binance's BTC/USDT trading page (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT)\n   - Historical kline/candlestick APIs ([1][2][3][12])\n3. **Search Result Limitations**:  \n   No explicit open/close values for the 9:00\u201310:00 UTC candle appear in the provided search results. Sources like CoinMarketCap [6][11], TradingView [33][58][61], and Coinalyze [36][37] offer aggregate or real-time data but lack the specific candle breakdown.\n4. **Ancillary Data Directive**:  \n   Per resolution conditions:\n   - p1 (Down) = 0\n   - p2 (Up) = 1\n   - p3 (Unknown) = 0.5  \n   If verifiable data is unavailable despite the event occurring in the past, resolution defaults to p3.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nNo verifiable open/close prices for the specified candle were found in the search results. While Binance's systems store this data, it is not retrievable from the provided context. Per the ancillary data protocol, the outcome defaults to **p3 (Unknown)** due to unverified information.\n\n**recommendation: p3**\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.99, ID: 103999105823088443645732052519051742238169557391155485684693873413307195065728, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.01, ID: 99949383007338329001814316121391697783512417800013446999028254426567301053420, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.990 = 99.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 19, 5AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price is greater than or equal to the open price for the BTC/USDT 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The close \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0C\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb and open \u00c2\u00ab\u00c2\u00a0O\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets. market_id: 553176\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750327654 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC",
        "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750327654 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 10:07:34 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Consider using a different solver that can access real-time or more accurate historical data directly from Binance to verify the open and close prices of the specified candle."
