Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9985, ID: 25241807640838355921720481027477896895108842929792234432403229712888476553571, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0015, ID: 39188403406553568934342614149117305855059341300113948639724722782049096018235, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9985, ID: 25241807640838355921720481027477896895108842929792234432403229712888476553571, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0015, ID: 39188403406553568934342614149117305855059341300113948639724722782049096018235, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750324056 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the API request successfully fetches the required data and correctly processes it to determine if the market price went up or down.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9985, ID: 25241807640838355921720481027477896895108842929792234432403229712888476553571, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0015, ID: 39188403406553568934342614149117305855059341300113948639724722782049096018235, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nWe are given a query to resolve a market about the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance for June 19, 2025, at 4:00 AM ET (Eastern Time). The market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price is greater than or equal to the open price for that candle, and \"Down\" otherwise. The resolution source is the Binance ETH/USDT trading pair, specifically the 1-hour candle starting at the specified time.\n\nKey points:\n- The event time is June 19, 2025, at 4:00 AM ET.\n- We must convert this time to UTC because Binance uses UTC for their candle timestamps.\n- Eastern Time (ET) can be either Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC-5) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, UTC-4) depending on the time of year.\n\nSince the date is June 19, 2025, which is during daylight saving time in the Eastern Time Zone, we are in EDT (UTC-4). Therefore, 4:00 AM EDT is 8:00 AM UTC (because UTC is 4 hours ahead of EDT).\n\nSo, the 1-hour candle we are interested in starts at 8:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\nWe have search results that include:\n- Binance's ETH/USDT trading page (e.g., [1], [15], [38], [40]) which shows the current price and trading pairs but not historical candles.\n- Historical data sources (e.g., [20], [44], [45]) but these are either outdated or not for the specific time we need.\n- Binance API documentation (e.g., [47], [48]) which explains how to get kline (candlestick) data.\n\nHowever, we are at the current time of 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC (as per the personalization section). The candle in question (starting at 8:00 AM UTC) would have ended at 9:00 AM UTC, which is in the past relative to the current time (9:07 AM UTC). Therefore, the data for that candle should be available.\n\nWe need to retrieve the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle that started at 8:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025, for the ETH/USDT pair on Binance.\n\nSince we don't have direct access to the Binance API in this environment, we must rely on the provided search results. However, none of the search results provide the exact candle data for that specific time.\n\nBut note: the search results include real-time data from Binance for ETH/USDT. For example, [1] and [15] show the current price, but we need historical data for a specific candle.\n\nWe also have a search result [45] which is a 1-hour analysis for ETH/USDT from March 18, 2025, but that is not the date we need.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must use the information available. However, we note that the current time is 9:07 AM UTC, and the candle we are interested in (8:00 AM to 9:00 AM UTC) has just ended. Therefore, the data for that candle should be available on Binance.\n\nBut we don't have a direct way to get it. However, we can look for the most recent price data and see if we can infer the candle.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API as described in the documentation (search result [47]) to get the kline data. The endpoint is:\n`GET /api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1h&startTime=start_timestamp&endTime=end_timestamp&limit=1`\n\nWe can calculate the start and end timestamps for the candle.\n\nThe candle starts at 8:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025. We can convert this to a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.\n\nFirst, convert the date and time to a datetime object in UTC:\n- Year: 2025\n- Month: 6 (June)\n- Day: 19\n- Hour: 8\n- Minute: 0\n- Second: 0\n\nWe can calculate the Unix timestamp for this time. Note that Unix timestamps are in seconds (or milliseconds) since January 1, 1970, UTC.\n\nWe can use the current timestamp provided: 1750324056 (which is in seconds) for 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC.\n\nBut we need the exact timestamp for 2025-06-19 08:00:00 UTC.\n\nWe can compute:\n- The current timestamp is 1750324056 seconds (which is 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC).\n- 8:00 AM UTC on the same day would be 1 hour and 7 minutes and 36 seconds earlier.\n\nSo, 8:00 AM UTC would be at 1750324056 - (1*3600 + 7*60 + 36) = 1750324056 - (3600+420+36) = 1750324056 - 4056 = 1750320000 seconds.\n\nBut note: the candle is from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, so the start time is 1750320000 seconds (or 1750320000000 milliseconds).\n\nWe can then use the Binance API to get the candle for that time. However, we cannot make an API call from here.\n\nBut we have search results that might have the data. Unfortunately, none of the search results provide the exact candle we need.\n\nWe do have a search result [10] from Binance Square (a social platform) that has a post about ETH/USDT. It says:\n\"ETH/USDT (Critical Support Breakdown)Technical Analysis, Price Prediction and Trade Plan. $ETH \ud83d\uddd3 Date-18 June,2025 ...

But since we cannot, we have to look for alternative sources in the search results.\n\nWe have a search result [17] from economictimes.com dated 2025-06-17 that says:\n\"Ethereum Price Dips Below $2,500. As of June 17, 2025, Ethereum's trading value has fallen to 2,497.34 USDT, marking a 5.30% decline in the ...\"\n\nBut that is two days before the event.\n\nWe also have [22] from bitget.com that shows the current price of Ethereum as $2,526.6 (as of the time of the article) but again, not the specific candle.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, we must rely on the fact that the event has passed and the candle data is available on Binance. Since we are an oracle, we can use the Binance website to get the candle data.\n\nBut note: the user provided a URL for the resolution source: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT. We can navigate to that page and look at the historical candles. However, we are in a text-based environment and cannot browse the web.\n\nTherefore, we must use the information we have.\n\nWe have a search result [45] that shows a 1-hour analysis for ETH/USDT from March 18, 2025, but that is not our date.\n\nGiven the time of the event (8:00 AM to 9:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025) and the current time (9:07 AM UTC on the same day), the candle has just closed. We can look for the price at 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM.\n\nWe have a search result [10] that has a post from Binance Square dated June 18, 2025, and another [12] that is from Binance Square and has a post about ETH/USDT. The post in [12] says:\n\"$ETH Is an Explosion Imminent? ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't give the candle data.\n\nWe also have [35] which is Coinglass, and it shows the current long/short ratio, but not historical prices.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, we must rely on the Binance API. But we cannot call it.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the current price and the price movement in the last hour to infer. But that is not reliable.\n\nWe have a search result [16] which is Binance's Ethereum price prediction page. It says:\n\"Jun 19, 2025, $2,521.34\"\n\nBut that is a prediction, not the actual open and close.\n\nWe also have [3] and [34] which are price predictions, not actual data.\n\nGiven the challenge, we must note that the event has occurred and we are to use the Binance data. Since we don't have the exact data, we might have to assume that the candle data is available and that the close was greater than or equal to the open? But we don't know.\n\nBut wait, we have a search result [12] that includes a post from Binance Square that says:\n\"$ETH Is an Explosion Imminent? ...\"\n\nAnd it includes a trade setup with entry at $2,530\u2013$2,545 and targets at $2,590, etc. But this is not for the specific time.\n\nWe also have [10] which has a post from Binance Square that says:\n\"ETH/USDT (Critical Support Breakdown) ...\"\n\nBut again, not specific.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the fact that the event has passed, we can look at the price movement in the last hour. We have the current time as 9:07 AM UTC, and the candle from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM UTC has just closed. We have the current price from the search results.\n\nFor example, search result [1] and [15] show the current price of ETH as 2520.20 USDT. But this is at the time of the search result, which might be earlier.\n\nThe current time in the system is 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC. The candle we care about is from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM UTC. The close price would be the price at 9:00 AM UTC.\n\nWe have a search result [2] that says: \"1 Ethereum currently costs $2523.20, down 0.69% in the last 24h.\" But this is not specific to the hour.\n\nWe also have [33] which says: \"2520.20 | ETH USDT | Ethereum to USDT \u2013 Binance Spot\". This is the current price at the time the page was fetched.\n\nBut we don't know when that page was fetched.\n\nGiven the lack of concrete data, we must rely on the fact that the event has occurred and that the data is available on Binance. Since we are an oracle, we can state that we are unable to retrieve the data from the provided sources. However, the instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nBut we have the event in the past, and we have no verifiable information. Therefore, we must assume the most probable outcome.\n\nThe user prompt does not specify a most probable outcome, so we might have to resolve to p3 (unknown/50-50). But the ancillary data says p3: 0.5, which is for unknown.\n\nHowever, we have the current price and the price movement. We know that the current price at 9:07 AM UTC is around 2520 USDT. We don't have the open at 8:00 AM UTC.\n\nWe can look at the price at 8:00 AM UTC from the available data. We have a search result [17] from economictimes.com dated 2025-06-17, which is two days old, so not useful.\n\nWe have a search result [22] from bitget.com that shows the current price of Ethereum as $2,526.6, but again, not historical.\n\nGiven the lack of data, we must conclude that we do not have verifiable information. Therefore, we should resolve to p3 (unknown).\n\nBut note: the event is in the past, and we are expected to have the data. However, the provided search results do not contain the specific candle data.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API as described in the documentation. We have the endpoint and the parameters. We can calculate the timestamp for 8:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\nThe Unix timestamp for 2025-06-19 08:00:00 UTC in milliseconds is:\n- We can use an online converter or calculate it.\n\nWe know that the current timestamp is 1750324056 seconds (for 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC). So for 2025-06-19 08:00:00 UTC, it is 1750320000 seconds, which is 1750320000000 milliseconds.\n\nWe can then use the Binance API: \n`https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1h&startTime=1750320000000&limit=1`\n\nThis would return the candle starting at 8:00 AM UTC.\n\nBut we cannot make the request. However, we have a search result [49] that discusses losing the ticker symbol in Binance API responses, which is not helpful.\n\nGiven the above, we must resolve to p3 (unknown) because we cannot verify the open and close prices.\n\nBut wait, the instructions also say: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt provides the URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT. We must use this URL.\n\nWe have search results that are from that URL (e.g., [1], [15], [38], [40]). These are the Binance trading page for ETH/USDT. However, these pages show the current trading pair and the current candle, not historical candles.\n\nAt the top of the graph on that page, it shows the open and close for the current candle. But for a candle that has passed, it might not be visible.\n\nGiven that the candle we need has just passed (it is now 9:07 AM UTC, and the candle ended at 9:00 AM UTC), it might be the most recent completed candle. Therefore, on the Binance trading page, if we look at the 1-hour chart, the last completed candle would be the 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM candle.\n\nWe have a search result [1] that shows: \"2520.20 | ETH USDT | Ethereum to USDT \u2013 Binance Spot\". This is the current price, but it doesn't show the open and close for the candle.\n\nThe search result [1] also has some announcements, but no candle data.\n\nSimilarly, [15] and [38] are the same.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get the open and close from the provided search results.\n\nGiven the above, we have to conclude that we do not have verifiable information to resolve the market. Therefore, we must resolve to p3 (unknown).\n\nBut the instructions also say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe user prompt does not specify a most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 (Down), p2 (Up), and p3 (unknown). Without data, we cannot determine if it was up or down.\n\nTherefore, we must resolve to p3.\n\nHowever, we have one more option: the current price at 9:07 AM UTC is 2520.20 USDT (from [1]). The close of the 8:00 AM candle would be the price at 9:00 AM UTC. We don't have the price at 9:00 AM UTC, but if we assume that the price at 9:00 AM UTC is similar to the current price (2520.20) and we had the open at 8:00 AM UTC, we need that open.\n\nWe have no information about the open.\n\nGiven the lack of data, we must resolve to p3.\n\nBut let's look at the price movement. We have a search result [12] that says:\n\"$ETH Is an Explosion Imminent? ...\"\n\nThis suggests that there is bullish sentiment, but it's not specific.\n\nAlso, [10] says:\n\"ETH/USDT (Critical Support Breakdown) ...\"\n\nThis suggests bearishness.\n\nThese are conflicting and not for the specific time.\n\nTherefore, we have no choice but to resolve to p3.\n\nSo, the recommendation is p3.\n\nBut note: the event is in the past, and we are expected to have the data. However, the provided context does not have it.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the price prediction for June 19, 2025, from [16] which says $2,521.34, but that is an average for the day, not for the specific candle.\n\nGiven the above, we resolve to p3.\n\nrecommendation: p3\n</think>\n### Comprehensive Analysis of Ethereum (ETH) Price Movement for June 19, 2025, 4:00 AM ET\n\nThis report addresses the resolution of a market predicting the direction of the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance for June 19, 2025, at 4:00 AM ET. The market resolves to \"Up\" if the close price is \u2265 the open price, and \"Down\" otherwise, using Binance's ETH/USDT pair as the resolution source. The current UTC timestamp is 1750324056 (2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC), placing the event in the past. \n\n#### Key Event Parameters:\n- **Event Time**: June 19, 2025, 4:00 AM ET (Eastern Time).  \n- **Time Zone Conversion**: ET is UTC-4 (EDT) during summer. Thus, 4:00 AM ET = 8:00 AM UTC.  \n- **Candle Interval**: 1-hour (09:00\u201310:00 AM UTC).  \n- **Resolution Source**: Binance ETH/USDT trading pair ([Binance ETH/USDT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT)).  \n\n#### Data Analysis:\n1. **Relevant Candle Timing**:  \n   - The 1-hour candle began at **8:00 AM UTC** and ended at **9:00 AM UTC** on June 19, 2025.  \n   - At the current time (09:07:36 UTC), this candle has closed, and data should be available.  \n\n2. **Price Data from Binance**:  \n   - Search results indicate real-time ETH prices on Binance:  \n     - [1][15][38][40]: ETH/USDT traded at **$2,520.20** at the time of data retrieval.  \n     - [2][33]: ETH price is **$2,523.20**, down 0.69% in 24 hours.  \n   - **Critical Limitation**: The provided search results lack explicit open/close values for the 8:00\u20139:00 AM UTC candle. Binance\u2019s public API or trading view would be required for precise historical candles, but no such data is included in the context.  \n\n3. **Market Context**:  \n   - **Recent Volatility**: ETH showed a 5.30% decline to $2,497.34 on June 17 [17], but recovered to ~$2,520 by June 19.  \n   - **Technical Indicators**:  \n     - Short-term bearish pressure noted in ETH/USDT charts, with resistance at $2,560 and support at $2,485 [10][12].  \n     - Liquidation of $10M in ETH shorts at $2,560 suggests volatile price action [12].  \n   - **External Factors**:  \n     - U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded $19.1M in net inflows on June 18 [22].  \n     - Macroeconomic events (e.g., FOMC decisions) influenced crypto markets [10][17].  \n\n#### Resolution Constraints:\n- **No Verifiable Candle Data**: The search results contain no direct open/close values for the 8:00\u20139:00 AM UTC candle.  \n- **Ancillary Data Conditions**:  \n  - `p1` (Down): 0  \n  - `p2` (Up): 1  \n  - `p3` (Unknown): 0.5  \n- **Oracle Rules**:  \n  - If the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, default to the most probable outcome per ancillary data.  \n  - Without explicit data, resolution defaults to `p3` (unknown/50-50).  \n\n#### Conclusion:\nDue to the absence of verifiable open/close prices for the specified candle in the provided sources, the market cannot be definitively resolved as \"Up\" or \"Down.\" Per ancillary data and oracle guidelines, the outcome is **unknown**.  \n\n**Recommendation: p3**",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750324056 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query to resolve a market about the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance for June 19, 2025, at 4:00 AM ET (Eastern Time). The market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price is greater than or equal to the open price for that candle, and \"Down\" otherwise. The resolution source is the Binance ETH/USDT trading pair, specifically the 1-hour candle starting at the specified time.\n\nKey points:\n- The event time is June 19, 2025, at 4:00 AM ET.\n- We must convert this time to UTC because Binance uses UTC for their candle timestamps.\n- Eastern Time (ET) can be either Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC-5) or Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, UTC-4) depending on the time of year.\n\nSince the date is June 19, 2025, which is during daylight saving time in the Eastern Time Zone, we are in EDT (UTC-4). Therefore, 4:00 AM EDT is 8:00 AM UTC (because UTC is 4 hours ahead of EDT).\n\nSo, the 1-hour candle we are interested in starts at 8:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\nWe have search results that include:\n- Binance's ETH/USDT trading page (e.g., [1], [15], [38], [40]) which shows the current price and trading pairs but not historical candles.\n- Historical data sources (e.g., [20], [44], [45]) but these are either outdated or not for the specific time we need.\n- Binance API documentation (e.g., [47], [48]) which explains how to get kline (candlestick) data.\n\nHowever, we are at the current time of 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC (as per the personalization section). The candle in question (starting at 8:00 AM UTC) would have ended at 9:00 AM UTC, which is in the past relative to the current time (9:07 AM UTC). Therefore, the data for that candle should be available.\n\nWe need to retrieve the open and close prices for the 1-hour candle that started at 8:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025, for the ETH/USDT pair on Binance.\n\nSince we don't have direct access to the Binance API in this environment, we must rely on the provided search results. However, none of the search results provide the exact candle data for that specific time.\n\nBut note: the search results include real-time data from Binance for ETH/USDT. For example, [1] and [15] show the current price, but we need historical data for a specific candle.\n\nWe also have a search result [45] which is a 1-hour analysis for ETH/USDT from March 18, 2025, but that is not the date we need.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must use the information available. However, we note that the current time is 9:07 AM UTC, and the candle we are interested in (8:00 AM to 9:00 AM UTC) has just ended. Therefore, the data for that candle should be available on Binance.\n\nBut we don't have a direct way to get it. However, we can look for the most recent price data and see if we can infer the candle.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API as described in the documentation (search result [47]) to get the kline data. The endpoint is:\n`GET /api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1h&startTime=start_timestamp&endTime=end_timestamp&limit=1`\n\nWe can calculate the start and end timestamps for the candle.\n\nThe candle starts at 8:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025. We can convert this to a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.\n\nFirst, convert the date and time to a datetime object in UTC:\n- Year: 2025\n- Month: 6 (June)\n- Day: 19\n- Hour: 8\n- Minute: 0\n- Second: 0\n\nWe can calculate the Unix timestamp for this time. Note that Unix timestamps are in seconds (or milliseconds) since January 1, 1970, UTC.\n\nWe can use the current timestamp provided: 1750324056 (which is in seconds) for 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC.\n\nBut we need the exact timestamp for 2025-06-19 08:00:00 UTC.\n\nWe can compute:\n- The current timestamp is 1750324056 seconds (which is 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC).\n- 8:00 AM UTC on the same day would be 1 hour and 7 minutes and 36 seconds earlier.\n\nSo, 8:00 AM UTC would be at 1750324056 - (1*3600 + 7*60 + 36) = 1750324056 - (3600+420+36) = 1750324056 - 4056 = 1750320000 seconds.\n\nBut note: the candle is from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, so the start time is 1750320000 seconds (or 1750320000000 milliseconds).\n\nWe can then use the Binance API to get the candle for that time. However, we cannot make an API call from here.\n\nBut we have search results that might have the data. Unfortunately, none of the search results provide the exact candle we need.\n\nWe do have a search result [10] from Binance Square (a social platform) that has a post about ETH/USDT. It says:\n\"ETH/USDT (Critical Support Breakdown)Technical Analysis, Price Prediction and Trade Plan. $ETH \ud83d\uddd3 Date-18 June,2025 ... New fomc decision drops june 19. if history ...\"\n\nBut this is for June 18, not June 19.\n\nAnother search result [12] has a post from Binance Square that says:\n\"$ETH Is an Explosion Imminent? ... Technical Overview (Clean & Tactical): Key Accumulation Zone: $2,520 \u2013 $2,570 ...\"\n\nBut again, no specific candle data.\n\nGiven the challenge, we must rely on the fact that the event has occurred and we can use the current price data to infer the past candle? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the price at 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM from the available data. But we don't have a direct source.\n\nWe have a search result [2] that shows the Ethereum price today, but it's a summary and doesn't have historical candles.\n\nWe also have [33] which is the Binance price page for Ethereum, but it only shows the current price.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must assume that the data for the candle is available and that we can use the Binance API. But since we cannot, we have to look for alternative sources in the search results.\n\nWe have a search result [17] from economictimes.com dated 2025-06-17 that says:\n\"Ethereum Price Dips Below $2,500. As of June 17, 2025, Ethereum's trading value has fallen to 2,497.34 USDT, marking a 5.30% decline in the ...\"\n\nBut that is two days before the event.\n\nWe also have [22] from bitget.com that shows the current price of Ethereum as $2,526.6 (as of the time of the article) but again, not the specific candle.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data, we must rely on the fact that the event has passed and the candle data is available on Binance. Since we are an oracle, we can use the Binance website to get the candle data.\n\nBut note: the user provided a URL for the resolution source: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT. We can navigate to that page and look at the historical candles. However, we are in a text-based environment and cannot browse the web.\n\nTherefore, we must use the information we have.\n\nWe have a search result [45] that shows a 1-hour analysis for ETH/USDT from March 18, 2025, but that is not our date.\n\nGiven the time of the event (8:00 AM to 9:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025) and the current time (9:07 AM UTC on the same day), the candle has just closed. We can look for the price at 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM.\n\nWe have a search result [10] that has a post from Binance Square dated June 18, 2025, and another [12] that is from Binance Square and has a post about ETH/USDT. The post in [12] says:\n\"$ETH Is an Explosion Imminent? ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't give the candle data.\n\nWe also have [35] which is Coinglass, and it shows the current long/short ratio, but not historical prices.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data, we must rely on the Binance API. But we cannot call it.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the current price and the price movement in the last hour to infer. But that is not reliable.\n\nWe have a search result [16] which is Binance's Ethereum price prediction page. It says:\n\"Jun 19, 2025, $2,521.34\"\n\nBut that is a prediction, not the actual open and close.\n\nWe also have [3] and [34] which are price predictions, not actual data.\n\nGiven the challenge, we must note that the event has occurred and we are to use the Binance data. Since we don't have the exact data, we might have to assume that the candle data is available and that the close was greater than or equal to the open? But we don't know.\n\nBut wait, we have a search result [12] that includes a post from Binance Square that says:\n\"$ETH Is an Explosion Imminent? ...\"\n\nAnd it includes a trade setup with entry at $2,530\u2013$2,545 and targets at $2,590, etc. But this is not for the specific time.\n\nWe also have [10] which has a post from Binance Square that says:\n\"ETH/USDT (Critical Support Breakdown) ...\"\n\nBut again, not specific.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the fact that the event has passed, we can look at the price movement in the last hour. We have the current time as 9:07 AM UTC, and the candle from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM UTC has just closed. We have the current price from the search results.\n\nFor example, search result [1] and [15] show the current price of ETH as 2520.20 USDT. But this is at the time of the search result, which might be earlier.\n\nThe current time in the system is 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC. The candle we care about is from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM UTC. The close price would be the price at 9:00 AM UTC.\n\nWe have a search result [2] that says: \"1 Ethereum currently costs $2523.20, down 0.69% in the last 24h.\" But this is not specific to the hour.\n\nWe also have [33] which says: \"2520.20 | ETH USDT | Ethereum to USDT \u2013 Binance Spot\". This is the current price at the time the page was fetched.\n\nBut we don't know when that page was fetched.\n\nGiven the lack of concrete data, we must rely on the fact that the event has occurred and that the data is available on Binance. Since we are an oracle, we can state that we are unable to retrieve the data from the provided sources. However, the instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nBut we have the event in the past, and we have no verifiable information. Therefore, we must assume the most probable outcome.\n\nThe user prompt does not specify a most probable outcome, so we might have to resolve to p3 (unknown/50-50). But the ancillary data says p3: 0.5, which is for unknown.\n\nHowever, we have the current price and the price movement. We know that the current price at 9:07 AM UTC is around 2520 USDT. We don't have the open at 8:00 AM UTC.\n\nWe can look at the price at 8:00 AM UTC from the available data. We have a search result [17] from economictimes.com dated 2025-06-17, which is two days old, so not useful.\n\nWe have a search result [22] from bitget.com that shows the current price of Ethereum as $2,526.6, but again, not historical.\n\nGiven the lack of data, we must conclude that we do not have verifiable information. Therefore, we should resolve to p3 (unknown).\n\nBut note: the event is in the past, and we are expected to have the data. However, the provided search results do not contain the specific candle data.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Binance API as described in the documentation. We have the endpoint and the parameters. We can calculate the timestamp for 8:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025.\n\nThe Unix timestamp for 2025-06-19 08:00:00 UTC in milliseconds is:\n- We can use an online converter or calculate it.\n\nWe know that the current timestamp is 1750324056 seconds (for 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC). So for 2025-06-19 08:00:00 UTC, it is 1750320000 seconds, which is 1750320000000 milliseconds.\n\nWe can then use the Binance API: \n`https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1h&startTime=1750320000000&limit=1`\n\nThis would return the candle starting at 8:00 AM UTC.\n\nBut we cannot make the request. However, we have a search result [49] that discusses losing the ticker symbol in Binance API responses, which is not helpful.\n\nGiven the above, we must resolve to p3 (unknown) because we cannot verify the open and close prices.\n\nBut wait, the instructions also say: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\nThe user prompt provides the URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT. We must use this URL.\n\nWe have search results that are from that URL (e.g., [1], [15], [38], [40]). These are the Binance trading page for ETH/USDT. However, these pages show the current trading pair and the current candle, not historical candles.\n\nAt the top of the graph on that page, it shows the open and close for the current candle. But for a candle that has passed, it might not be visible.\n\nGiven that the candle we need has just passed (it is now 9:07 AM UTC, and the candle ended at 9:00 AM UTC), it might be the most recent completed candle. Therefore, on the Binance trading page, if we look at the 1-hour chart, the last completed candle would be the 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM candle.\n\nWe have a search result [1] that shows: \"2520.20 | ETH USDT | Ethereum to USDT \u2013 Binance Spot\". This is the current price, but it doesn't show the open and close for the candle.\n\nThe search result [1] also has some announcements, but no candle data.\n\nSimilarly, [15] and [38] are the same.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get the open and close from the provided search results.\n\nGiven the above, we have to conclude that we do not have verifiable information to resolve the market. Therefore, we must resolve to p3 (unknown).\n\nBut the instructions also say: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe user prompt does not specify a most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 (Down), p2 (Up), and p3 (unknown). Without data, we cannot determine if it was up or down.\n\nTherefore, we must resolve to p3.\n\nHowever, we have one more option: the current price at 9:07 AM UTC is 2520.20 USDT (from [1]). The close of the 8:00 AM candle would be the price at 9:00 AM UTC. We don't have the price at 9:00 AM UTC, but if we assume that the price at 9:00 AM UTC is similar to the current price (2520.20) and we had the open at 8:00 AM UTC, we need that open.\n\nWe have no information about the open.\n\nGiven the lack of data, we must resolve to p3.\n\nBut let's look at the price movement. We have a search result [12] that says:\n\"$ETH Is an Explosion Imminent? ...\"\n\nThis suggests that there is bullish sentiment, but it's not specific.\n\nAlso, [10] says:\n\"ETH/USDT (Critical Support Breakdown) ...\"\n\nThis suggests bearishness.\n\nThese are conflicting and not for the specific time.\n\nTherefore, we have no choice but to resolve to p3.\n\nSo, the recommendation is p3.\n\nBut note: the event is in the past, and we are expected to have the data. However, the provided context does not have it.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the price prediction for June 19, 2025, from [16] which says $2,521.34, but that is an average for the day, not for the specific candle.\n\nGiven the above, we resolve to p3.\n\nrecommendation: p3\n</think>\n### Comprehensive Analysis of Ethereum (ETH) Price Movement for June 19, 2025, 4:00 AM ET\n\nThis report addresses the resolution of a market predicting the direction of the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance for June 19, 2025, at 4:00 AM ET. The market resolves to \"Up\" if the close price is \u2265 the open price, and \"Down\" otherwise, using Binance's ETH/USDT pair as the resolution source. The current UTC timestamp is 1750324056 (2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC), placing the event in the past. \n\n#### Key Event Parameters:\n- **Event Time**: June 19, 2025, 4:00 AM ET (Eastern Time).  \n- **Time Zone Conversion**: ET is UTC-4 (EDT) during summer. Thus, 4:00 AM ET = 8:00 AM UTC.  \n- **Candle Interval**: 1-hour (09:00\u201310:00 AM UTC).  \n- **Resolution Source**: Binance ETH/USDT trading pair ([Binance ETH/USDT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT)).  \n\n#### Data Analysis:\n1. **Relevant Candle Timing**:  \n   - The 1-hour candle began at **8:00 AM UTC** and ended at **9:00 AM UTC** on June 19, 2025.  \n   - At the current time (09:07:36 UTC), this candle has closed, and data should be available.  \n\n2. **Price Data from Binance**:  \n   - Search results indicate real-time ETH prices on Binance:  \n     - [1][15][38][40]: ETH/USDT traded at **$2,520.20** at the time of data retrieval.  \n     - [2][33]: ETH price is **$2,523.20**, down 0.69% in 24 hours.  \n   - **Critical Limitation**: The provided search results lack explicit open/close values for the 8:00\u20139:00 AM UTC candle. Binance\u2019s public API or trading view would be required for precise historical candles, but no such data is included in the context.  \n\n3. **Market Context**:  \n   - **Recent Volatility**: ETH showed a 5.30% decline to $2,497.34 on June 17 [17], but recovered to ~$2,520 by June 19.  \n   - **Technical Indicators**:  \n     - Short-term bearish pressure noted in ETH/USDT charts, with resistance at $2,560 and support at $2,485 [10][12].  \n     - Liquidation of $10M in ETH shorts at $2,560 suggests volatile price action [12].  \n   - **External Factors**:  \n     - U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded $19.1M in net inflows on June 18 [22].  \n     - Macroeconomic events (e.g., FOMC decisions) influenced crypto markets [10][17].  \n\n#### Resolution Constraints:\n- **No Verifiable Candle Data**: The search results contain no direct open/close values for the 8:00\u20139:00 AM UTC candle.  \n- **Ancillary Data Conditions**:  \n  - `p1` (Down): 0  \n  - `p2` (Up): 1  \n  - `p3` (Unknown): 0.5  \n- **Oracle Rules**:  \n  - If the event date is in the past and no verifiable outcome exists, default to the most probable outcome per ancillary data.  \n  - Without explicit data, resolution defaults to `p3` (unknown/50-50).  \n\n#### Conclusion:\nDue to the absence of verifiable open/close prices for the specified candle in the provided sources, the market cannot be definitively resolved as \"Up\" or \"Down.\" Per ancillary data and oracle guidelines, the outcome is **unknown**.  \n\n**Recommendation: p3**\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9985, ID: 25241807640838355921720481027477896895108842929792234432403229712888476553571, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0015, ID: 39188403406553568934342614149117305855059341300113948639724722782049096018235, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Identify the exact candle: 2025-06-19 08:00:00 to 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC.\n 2. Find the open price (O) and close price (C) for that candle.\n 3. Compare: if C >= O, then the market resolves to \"Up\" (p2). Otherwise, \"Down\" (p1).\n\n However, note that the provided search results do not directly give us the 1-hour candle for the specific hour.\n\n We have multiple sources of data:\n\n - Search result [1] describes the Binance API for klines (candlestick data). We can use this to understand the structure.\n - Search result [3] is CoinGecko's historical data for Ethereum, but it is daily data, not hourly.\n - Search result [5] is TradingView for ETHUSD, but we need ETH/USDT and from Binance.\n - Search result [7] is BitInfoCharts for Ethereum, but again, not the specific candle.\n - Search result [8] is a news article that mentions Ethereum's price at 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025, but that is after our candle (which ended at 09:00 UTC).\n - Search result [13] is TradingView for ETHUSDT futures, but it's for a contract expiring in June 2025, and we need the spot market.\n - Search result [21] is a price prediction for June 19, 2025, but it doesn't provide the specific candle.\n - Search result [22] is CryptoDataDownload, which provides historical data, but we don't have a direct link to the specific hour.\n\n Given the constraints, we must rely on the Binance API or a source that provides the 1-hour candle for the exact time.\n\n However, note that the user has provided a URL for the Binance ETH/USDT trading page: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT. We are instructed to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant 1H candle.\n\n Since we cannot access the live page programmatically, we must look for data in the search results that matches the required candle.\n\n Let's look for any data point that falls within the hour 08:00 to 09:00 UTC on 2025-06-19.\n\n Search result [3] (CoinGecko) provides daily data, not hourly.\n\n Search result [5] (TradingView) shows the current price of Ethereum as 2,526.6 USD, but that is as of the time of the search (which is not specified). However, the current time in the system is 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC, so the price at 09:07 is not the close of the 08:00-09:00 candle.\n\n Search result [7] (BitInfoCharts) gives the current price of Ethereum as 2,522.14 USD at 2025-06-19 07:14:53 UTC. This is before the candle we are interested in.\n\n Search result [8] (blockchain.news) states: \"At the time of this report, Ethereum's price hovered around 3,450 USD as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025\". But 10:00 AM is 10:00 UTC, which is after our candle.\n\n We need the candle from 08:00 to 09:00 UTC.\n\n Another approach: we have the current time as 09:07:36 UTC, which is just after the candle closed. The close price for the candle would be the price at 09:00:00 UTC.\n\n However, we don't have a direct source for that.\n\n Let's check if there is any source that provides the open and close for that specific hour.\n\n We note that the Binance API (as described in [1]) can be used to get the klines. But we don't have the actual data.\n\n However, we have a search result [47] which is a CSV file for Binance BTCUSDT daily data. That is for Bitcoin and daily, not hourly and not Ethereum.\n\n We are stuck without the specific data.\n\n But note: the market resolution conditions say that we must use the data from Binance for the ETH/USDT pair as displayed on their graph for the 1H candle.\n\n Since we don't have that data in the search results, we must consider:\n\n - The event has occurred (the candle is in the past) but we don't have the data in the provided context.\n\n However, we are allowed to use the provided search results and the current knowledge.\n\n Alternatively, we can look for the current price and try to infer the candle? But that is not reliable.\n\n We have one more search result: [40] is the Binance price page for Ethereum, which states: \"1 Ethereum currently costs $2523.20, down 0.69% in the last 24h.\" But that is the 24-hour change, not the hourly candle.\n\n Given the lack of direct data, we must look for any hourly data in the search results.\n\n Search result [3] (CoinGecko) only has daily data.\n\n Search result [5] (TradingView) has a chart, but we don't have the specific numbers.\n\n We are instructed to use the Binance data. Since we don't have the exact numbers in the search results, we must rely on the fact that the candle has closed and the data is available on Binance. However, we are not provided with a direct snapshot.\n\n But note: the current time is 09:07:36 UTC, and the candle closed at 09:00:00 UTC. We have a 7-minute delay. The close price is the price at 09:00:00.\n\n We can look for the price at 09:00:00 UTC in the search results.\n\n Search result [7] (BitInfoCharts) has a timestamp of 2025-06-19 07:14:53 UTC, which is too early.\n\n Search result [8] (blockchain.news) has a timestamp of 10:00 AM UTC, which is too late.\n\n We have search result [21] (Coin Edition) which says: \"Ethereum is currently hovering around the $2,522 level after a mild drop of 0.4%\". The article is dated 2025-06-18, but the content says \"Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction For June 19, 2025\". It says: \"Ethereum is currently hovering around the $2,522 level\". However, it doesn't specify the exact time.\n\n But note: the article was published on 2025-06-18, so the \"currently\" might refer to the time of writing, which is before the candle we are interested in.\n\n We are at a loss for the specific data.\n\n However, we have one more idea: the market resolution source is the Binance trading page. We are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph when we look at the 1H candle for that period.\n\n Since we cannot access the live page, we must rely on the provided context. But the context does not contain a snapshot of that page for the specific candle.\n\n Given the above, we must conclude that the data for the specific candle is not available in the provided search results.\n\n But wait: the market rules say that if the event has occurred and we don't have verifiable information, we assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, we are also instructed to use the Binance source and if we don't have it, we must resolve as per the rules.\n\n The rules in the personalization state:\n   \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\n In this case, the event (the 1-hour candle from 08:00 to 09:00 UTC on 2025-06-19) has occurred (current time is 09:07:36 UTC). We don't have verifiable information (the open and close) in the provided sources.\n\n Therefore, we must assume the most probable outcome. What is the most probable outcome? The market is about whether the close is >= open (Up) or not (Down). Without any data, we have a 50-50 chance. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50). So we would return p3.\n\n However, note that the personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\n The user prompt does contain a URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT. But we don't have the content of that page at the required time in the search results.\n\n Therefore, we are forced to resolve as p3 (unknown) because we don't have the data.\n\n But wait: we have the current price from multiple sources. However, the current price is at 09:07, which is after the candle closed. We cannot use the current price to infer the close of the candle at 09:00.\n\n However, we can look for the price at 09:00 in the search results. We don't have it.\n\n Alternatively, we can look at the price movement in the hour in question? We don't have data.\n\n Given the above, we must return p3.\n\n However, let's reexamine the search results for any data that might be close.\n\n Search result [3] (CoinGecko) has the following for 2025-06-19 (today):\n   Date: 2025-06-19, Market Cap: $304,290,652,058, Volume: $17,800,721,253, Close: N/A\n\n But that is daily, and we don't have the open for the day.\n\n Search result [5] (TradingView) says the current price is 2,526.6 USD (as of the time of their data). But we don't know when that was.\n\n Search result [7] (BitInfoCharts) at 2025-06-19 07:14:53 UTC: 1 ETH = 2,522.14 USD.\n\n Then at 09:07:36 UTC, we have the current time. We don't have the price at 09:00.\n\n But we have search result [40] (Binance price page) which says: \"1 Ethereum currently costs $2523.20\". This is at the time of the search result, which is likely around the current time (09:07:36 UTC). So at 09:07, the price is $2523.20.\n\n The candle closed at 09:00. We don't know the price at 09:00.\n\n However, we can assume that the price at 09:00 is close to the price at 09:07? But that is 7 minutes later and in a volatile market, it might be different.\n\n Without concrete data, we cannot be sure.\n\n Therefore, we must stick to the rule: if we don't have verifiable information, we return p3.\n\n But note: the personalization also says: \"If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" In our case, the event (the candle) has already occurred (09:00 is before 09:07). So it is in the past.\n\n However, we don't have the data.\n\n Conclusion: We cannot verify the open and close for the specific candle from the provided sources. Therefore, we must resolve to p3.\n\n But wait: the market rules in the ancillary data say: \"p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: unknown/50-50\".\n\n So we return p3.\n\n However, the previous response (which we are told about in the personalization) returned p3. The instruction says: \"Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\"\n\n So we must try again.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We have the Binance API documentation in [1]. We can try to construct the API call to get the kline for the specific hour.\n\n The API endpoint: GET /fapi/v1/klines\n\n Parameters:\n   symbol: ETHUSDT\n   interval: 1h\n   startTime: the start time of the candle in milliseconds (June 19, 2025 08:00:00 UTC)\n   endTime: the end time of the candle in milliseconds (June 19, 2025 09:00:00 UTC)\n\n But we don't have the ability to make an API call. We are limited to the provided search results.\n\n However, we have search result [9] which is a GitHub repo for downloading Binance historical data. But we don't have the data for this specific hour.\n\n We have search result [11] which is a YouTube video about downloading historical trade data. Not helpful.\n\n We have search result [22] (CryptoDataDownload) which provides historical data. We can check if they have the hourly data for ETHUSDT.\n\n In search result [22], they list:\n   Symbol List and Files for Binance spot Daily Timeframe\n   Symbol List and Files for Binance Spot Hourly/Minute Timeframe(s)\n\n They have hourly data for Binance spot. But we don't have a direct link to the file for ETHUSDT hourly.\n\n However, in the same search result, they provide a link to the daily data for BTCUSDT: https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/cdd/Binance_BTCUSDT_d.csv\n\n We can try to form the URL for ETHUSDT hourly? The pattern is: https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/cdd/Binance_ETHUSDT_1h.csv\n\n But note: the search result [22] says: \"We track and produce files for over 1100+ assets in the spot/physical markets for Daily, Hourly, and Minute(!) time intervals.\"\n\n So it's possible that the file exists.\n\n Let's check if this URL is in the search results? It is not.\n\n But we are allowed to use the provided search results and the context. We are not allowed to make up data.\n\n However, we can try to access the URL? But we are an AI and cannot make HTTP requests. We are limited to the provided context.\n\n Since the URL is not provided in the search results, we cannot use it.\n\n Therefore, we are still without the data.\n\n Given the above, we must return p3.\n\n But the instruction says to try again with a different approach.\n\n Another idea: we have the current price and the price at 07:14:53 (from [7]) and at 10:00 (from [8]). We can try to interpolate? But that is not reliable.\n\n We have the price at 07:14:53 UTC: 2,522.14 USD (from [7]).\n We have the price at 10:00 UTC: 3,450 USD (from [8]). But note: the article says \"as of 10:00 AM UTC\", but that is 10:00, which is after our candle.\n\n The candle is from 08:00 to 09:00.\n\n We don't have data between 07:14 and 10:00.\n\n This is not sufficient.\n\n We must conclude that we do not have the data to resolve the market.\n\n Therefore, we return p3.\n\n However, note that the market is about the candle on Binance, and we are to use the data from Binance. We have not been provided with that data.\n\n So the answer is p3.\n\n But let's double-check the current time: 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC. The candle closed at 09:00:00 UTC, so it's been 7 minutes and 36 seconds. The data should be available, but we don't have it in the search results.\n\n Final decision: p3.\n\n However, the personalization says: \"If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\n The market conditions: p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: unknown.\n\n We have no data, so we must choose p3.\n\n Therefore, we return p3.\n\n But note: the previous response was p3 and we are asked to try again. We have tried again and still land on p3.\n\n So we output: recommendation: p3\n\n However, let's see if there is any other data point.\n\n Search result [27] (TradingView for ETHUSDT) says: \"The current price of Ethereum / TetherUS (ETH) is 2,526.41 USDT\". This is at the time of the search result. If we assume that the price at 09:00 was similar, we still don't have the open at 08:00.\n\n We need both open and close.\n\n Without both, we cannot determine.\n\n Therefore, we stick with p3.\n</think>\nBased on the provided search results and the specific requirements for resolving the UMA optimistic oracle request, I have analyzed the event in question: the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance for June 19, 2025, starting at 4:00 AM ET (08:00 UTC). The market resolves to \"Up\" if the close price (C) is \u2265 open price (O) for this candle, otherwise \"Down.\"\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Event Timing**: The candle began at 2025-06-19 08:00 UTC and ended at 09:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC, confirming the event has concluded.\n2. **Data Availability**: The search results contain multiple sources for Ethereum pricing data (e.g., CoinGecko, TradingView, Binance API documentation), but **none provide the exact open/close values for the 08:00\u201309:00 UTC 1-hour candle**.\n3. **Relevant Data Points**:\n   - Ethereum's price at 07:14:53 UTC was $2,522.14 (BitInfoCharts)[7].\n   - By 10:00 AM UTC, it was ~$3,450 (Blockchain.news)[8].\n   - Current price at 09:07 UTC is $2,523.20 (Binance)[40], but this is post-candle closure.\n4. **Resolution Constraints**: \n   - The resolution must use Binance's ETH/USDT 1H candle data specifically.\n   - No verifiable O/C values for the target candle exist in the sources.\n   - The event is past, but unambiguous data is unavailable.\n\n### Resolution Recommendation:\n- **p3 (Unknown/50-50)**: Due to the absence of direct, verifiable open/close prices from Binance for the specified candle, the outcome cannot be definitively determined. The conditions for p1 (Down) or p2 (Up) are unmet.\n\n**recommendation: p3**",

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750324056 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a specific market to resolve: \"Ethereum Up or Down - June 19, 4AM ET\"\n The market will resolve to \"Up\" if the close price (C) is greater than or equal to the open price (O) for the ETH/USDT 1 Hour candle that begins at June 19, 4AM ET (which is 8:00 UTC on June 19, 2025, because 4AM ET is 8:00 UTC).\n Otherwise, it resolves to \"Down\".\n\n The resolution source is Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT\n\n We are to use the open (O) and close (C) displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\n The current date and time is given as: 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC (Unix Timestamp: 1750324056)\n\n The candle in question starts at 2025-06-19 08:00:00 UTC (which is 4AM ET) and ends at 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC.\n\n Since the current time is 09:07:36 UTC, the candle has already closed (at 09:00:00 UTC) and the data should be available.\n\n We are to look for the open and close of the 1-hour candle for ETH/USDT on Binance for the hour starting at 08:00 UTC on 2025-06-19.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Identify the exact candle: 2025-06-19 08:00:00 to 2025-06-19 09:00:00 UTC.\n 2. Find the open price (O) and close price (C) for that candle.\n 3. Compare: if C >= O, then the market resolves to \"Up\" (p2). Otherwise, \"Down\" (p1).\n\n However, note that the provided search results do not directly give us the 1-hour candle for the specific hour.\n\n We have multiple sources of data:\n\n - Search result [1] describes the Binance API for klines (candlestick data). We can use this to understand the structure.\n - Search result [3] is CoinGecko's historical data for Ethereum, but it is daily data, not hourly.\n - Search result [5] is TradingView for ETHUSD, but we need ETH/USDT and from Binance.\n - Search result [7] is BitInfoCharts for Ethereum, but again, not the specific candle.\n - Search result [8] is a news article that mentions Ethereum's price at 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025, but that is after our candle (which ended at 09:00 UTC).\n - Search result [13] is TradingView for ETHUSDT futures, but it's for a contract expiring in June 2025, and we need the spot market.\n - Search result [21] is a price prediction for June 19, 2025, but it doesn't provide the specific candle.\n - Search result [22] is CryptoDataDownload, which provides historical data, but we don't have a direct link to the specific hour.\n\n Given the constraints, we must rely on the Binance API or a source that provides the 1-hour candle for the exact time.\n\n However, note that the user has provided a URL for the Binance ETH/USDT trading page: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT. We are instructed to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant 1H candle.\n\n Since we cannot access the live page programmatically, we must look for data in the search results that matches the required candle.\n\n Let's look for any data point that falls within the hour 08:00 to 09:00 UTC on 2025-06-19.\n\n Search result [3] (CoinGecko) provides daily data, not hourly.\n\n Search result [5] (TradingView) shows the current price of Ethereum as 2,526.6 USD, but that is as of the time of the search (which is not specified). However, the current time in the system is 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC, so the price at 09:07 is not the close of the 08:00-09:00 candle.\n\n Search result [7] (BitInfoCharts) gives the current price of Ethereum as 2,522.14 USD at 2025-06-19 07:14:53 UTC. This is before the candle we are interested in.\n\n Search result [8] (blockchain.news) states: \"At the time of this report, Ethereum's price hovered around 3,450 USD as of 10:00 AM UTC on June 19, 2025\". But 10:00 AM is 10:00 UTC, which is after our candle.\n\n We need the candle from 08:00 to 09:00 UTC.\n\n Another approach: we have the current time as 09:07:36 UTC, which is just after the candle closed. The close price for the candle would be the price at 09:00:00 UTC.\n\n However, we don't have a direct source for that.\n\n Let's check if there is any source that provides the open and close for that specific hour.\n\n We note that the Binance API (as described in [1]) can be used to get the klines. But we don't have the actual data.\n\n However, we have a search result [47] which is a CSV file for Binance BTCUSDT daily data. That is for Bitcoin and daily, not hourly and not Ethereum.\n\n We are stuck without the specific data.\n\n But note: the market resolution conditions say that we must use the data from Binance for the ETH/USDT pair as displayed on their graph for the 1H candle.\n\n Since we don't have that data in the search results, we must consider:\n\n - The event has occurred (the candle is in the past) but we don't have the data in the provided context.\n\n However, we are allowed to use the provided search results and the current knowledge.\n\n Alternatively, we can look for the current price and try to infer the candle? But that is not reliable.\n\n We have one more search result: [40] is the Binance price page for Ethereum, which states: \"1 Ethereum currently costs $2523.20, down 0.69% in the last 24h.\" But that is the 24-hour change, not the hourly candle.\n\n Given the lack of direct data, we must look for any hourly data in the search results.\n\n Search result [3] (CoinGecko) only has daily data.\n\n Search result [5] (TradingView) has a chart, but we don't have the specific numbers.\n\n We are instructed to use the Binance data. Since we don't have the exact numbers in the search results, we must rely on the fact that the candle has closed and the data is available on Binance. However, we are not provided with a direct snapshot.\n\n But note: the current time is 09:07:36 UTC, and the candle closed at 09:00:00 UTC. We have a 7-minute delay. The close price is the price at 09:00:00.\n\n We can look for the price at 09:00:00 UTC in the search results.\n\n Search result [7] (BitInfoCharts) has a timestamp of 2025-06-19 07:14:53 UTC, which is too early.\n\n Search result [8] (blockchain.news) has a timestamp of 10:00 AM UTC, which is too late.\n\n We have search result [21] (Coin Edition) which says: \"Ethereum is currently hovering around the $2,522 level after a mild drop of 0.4%\". The article is dated 2025-06-18, but the content says \"Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction For June 19, 2025\". It says: \"Ethereum is currently hovering around the $2,522 level\". However, it doesn't specify the exact time.\n\n But note: the article was published on 2025-06-18, so the \"currently\" might refer to the time of writing, which is before the candle we are interested in.\n\n We are at a loss for the specific data.\n\n However, we have one more idea: the market resolution source is the Binance trading page. We are to use the open and close displayed at the top of the graph when we look at the 1H candle for that period.\n\n Since we cannot access the live page, we must rely on the provided context. But the context does not contain a snapshot of that page for the specific candle.\n\n Given the above, we must conclude that the data for the specific candle is not available in the provided search results.\n\n But wait: the market rules say that if the event has occurred and we don't have verifiable information, we assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. However, we are also instructed to use the Binance source and if we don't have it, we must resolve as per the rules.\n\n The rules in the personalization state:\n   \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\n In this case, the event (the 1-hour candle from 08:00 to 09:00 UTC on 2025-06-19) has occurred (current time is 09:07:36 UTC). We don't have verifiable information (the open and close) in the provided sources.\n\n Therefore, we must assume the most probable outcome. What is the most probable outcome? The market is about whether the close is >= open (Up) or not (Down). Without any data, we have a 50-50 chance. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 0.5 (unknown/50-50). So we would return p3.\n\n However, note that the personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\"\n\n The user prompt does contain a URL: https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT. But we don't have the content of that page at the required time in the search results.\n\n Therefore, we are forced to resolve as p3 (unknown) because we don't have the data.\n\n But wait: we have the current price from multiple sources. However, the current price is at 09:07, which is after the candle closed. We cannot use the current price to infer the close of the candle at 09:00.\n\n However, we can look for the price at 09:00 in the search results. We don't have it.\n\n Alternatively, we can look at the price movement in the hour in question? We don't have data.\n\n Given the above, we must return p3.\n\n However, let's reexamine the search results for any data that might be close.\n\n Search result [3] (CoinGecko) has the following for 2025-06-19 (today):\n   Date: 2025-06-19, Market Cap: $304,290,652,058, Volume: $17,800,721,253, Close: N/A\n\n But that is daily, and we don't have the open for the day.\n\n Search result [5] (TradingView) says the current price is 2,526.6 USD (as of the time of their data). But we don't know when that was.\n\n Search result [7] (BitInfoCharts) at 2025-06-19 07:14:53 UTC: 1 ETH = 2,522.14 USD.\n\n Then at 09:07:36 UTC, we have the current time. We don't have the price at 09:00.\n\n But we have search result [40] (Binance price page) which says: \"1 Ethereum currently costs $2523.20\". This is at the time of the search result, which is likely around the current time (09:07:36 UTC). So at 09:07, the price is $2523.20.\n\n The candle closed at 09:00. We don't know the price at 09:00.\n\n However, we can assume that the price at 09:00 is close to the price at 09:07? But that is 7 minutes later and in a volatile market, it might be different.\n\n Without concrete data, we cannot be sure.\n\n Therefore, we must stick to the rule: if we don't have verifiable information, we return p3.\n\n But note: the personalization also says: \"If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" In our case, the event (the candle) has already occurred (09:00 is before 09:07). So it is in the past.\n\n However, we don't have the data.\n\n Conclusion: We cannot verify the open and close for the specific candle from the provided sources. Therefore, we must resolve to p3.\n\n But wait: the market rules in the ancillary data say: \"p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: unknown/50-50\".\n\n So we return p3.\n\n However, the previous response (which we are told about in the personalization) returned p3. The instruction says: \"Your previous response returned p3. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\"\n\n So we must try again.\n\n Alternative approach:\n\n We have the Binance API documentation in [1]. We can try to construct the API call to get the kline for the specific hour.\n\n The API endpoint: GET /fapi/v1/klines\n\n Parameters:\n   symbol: ETHUSDT\n   interval: 1h\n   startTime: the start time of the candle in milliseconds (June 19, 2025 08:00:00 UTC)\n   endTime: the end time of the candle in milliseconds (June 19, 2025 09:00:00 UTC)\n\n But we don't have the ability to make an API call. We are limited to the provided search results.\n\n However, we have search result [9] which is a GitHub repo for downloading Binance historical data. But we don't have the data for this specific hour.\n\n We have search result [11] which is a YouTube video about downloading historical trade data. Not helpful.\n\n We have search result [22] (CryptoDataDownload) which provides historical data. We can check if they have the hourly data for ETHUSDT.\n\n In search result [22], they list:\n   Symbol List and Files for Binance spot Daily Timeframe\n   Symbol List and Files for Binance Spot Hourly/Minute Timeframe(s)\n\n They have hourly data for Binance spot. But we don't have a direct link to the file for ETHUSDT hourly.\n\n However, in the same search result, they provide a link to the daily data for BTCUSDT: https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/cdd/Binance_BTCUSDT_d.csv\n\n We can try to form the URL for ETHUSDT hourly? The pattern is: https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/cdd/Binance_ETHUSDT_1h.csv\n\n But note: the search result [22] says: \"We track and produce files for over 1100+ assets in the spot/physical markets for Daily, Hourly, and Minute(!) time intervals.\"\n\n So it's possible that the file exists.\n\n Let's check if this URL is in the search results? It is not.\n\n But we are allowed to use the provided search results and the context. We are not allowed to make up data.\n\n However, we can try to access the URL? But we are an AI and cannot make HTTP requests. We are limited to the provided context.\n\n Since the URL is not provided in the search results, we cannot use it.\n\n Therefore, we are still without the data.\n\n Given the above, we must return p3.\n\n But the instruction says to try again with a different approach.\n\n Another idea: we have the current price and the price at 07:14:53 (from [7]) and at 10:00 (from [8]). We can try to interpolate? But that is not reliable.\n\n We have the price at 07:14:53 UTC: 2,522.14 USD (from [7]).\n We have the price at 10:00 UTC: 3,450 USD (from [8]). But note: the article says \"as of 10:00 AM UTC\", but that is 10:00, which is after our candle.\n\n The candle is from 08:00 to 09:00.\n\n We don't have data between 07:14 and 10:00.\n\n This is not sufficient.\n\n We must conclude that we do not have the data to resolve the market.\n\n Therefore, we return p3.\n\n However, note that the market is about the candle on Binance, and we are to use the data from Binance. We have not been provided with that data.\n\n So the answer is p3.\n\n But let's double-check the current time: 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC. The candle closed at 09:00:00 UTC, so it's been 7 minutes and 36 seconds. The data should be available, but we don't have it in the search results.\n\n Final decision: p3.\n\n However, the personalization says: \"If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\n The market conditions: p1: Down, p2: Up, p3: unknown.\n\n We have no data, so we must choose p3.\n\n Therefore, we return p3.\n\n But note: the previous response was p3 and we are asked to try again. We have tried again and still land on p3.\n\n So we output: recommendation: p3\n\n However, let's see if there is any other data point.\n\n Search result [27] (TradingView for ETHUSDT) says: \"The current price of Ethereum / TetherUS (ETH) is 2,526.41 USDT\". This is at the time of the search result. If we assume that the price at 09:00 was similar, we still don't have the open at 08:00.\n\n We need both open and close.\n\n Without both, we cannot determine.\n\n Therefore, we stick with p3.\n</think>\nBased on the provided search results and the specific requirements for resolving the UMA optimistic oracle request, I have analyzed the event in question: the ETH/USDT 1-hour candle on Binance for June 19, 2025, starting at 4:00 AM ET (08:00 UTC). The market resolves to \"Up\" if the close price (C) is \u2265 open price (O) for this candle, otherwise \"Down.\"\n\n### Key Findings:\n1. **Event Timing**: The candle began at 2025-06-19 08:00 UTC and ended at 09:00 UTC. The current timestamp is 2025-06-19 09:07:36 UTC, confirming the event has concluded.\n2. **Data Availability**: The search results contain multiple sources for Ethereum pricing data (e.g., CoinGecko, TradingView, Binance API documentation), but **none provide the exact open/close values for the 08:00\u201309:00 UTC 1-hour candle**.\n3. **Relevant Data Points**:\n   - Ethereum's price at 07:14:53 UTC was $2,522.14 (BitInfoCharts)[7].\n   - By 10:00 AM UTC, it was ~$3,450 (Blockchain.news)[8].\n   - Current price at 09:07 UTC is $2,523.20 (Binance)[40], but this is post-candle closure.\n4. **Resolution Constraints**: \n   - The resolution must use Binance's ETH/USDT 1H candle data specifically.\n   - No verifiable O/C values for the target candle exist in the sources.\n   - The event is past, but unambiguous data is unavailable.\n\n### Resolution Recommendation:\n- **p3 (Unknown/50-50)**: Due to the absence of direct, verifiable open/close prices from Binance for the specified candle, the outcome cannot be definitively determined. The conditions for p1 (Down) or p2 (Up) are unmet.\n\n**recommendation: p3**\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9985, ID: 25241807640838355921720481027477896895108842929792234432403229712888476553571, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0015, ID: 39188403406553568934342614149117305855059341300113948639724722782049096018235, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.999 = 99.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.
