The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"God\" three or more times during his West Point commencement speech on May 24, 2025. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to review the provided search results to find instances where Trump mentioned \"God.\" The search results include transcripts and articles about the speech. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at result [2], the transcript from the White House YouTube channel, Trump says, \"God bless you, God bless the United States Army, and God bless America.\" That's three mentions right there. \n\nResult [29] is a transcript from Rev.com where Trump ends his speech with \"God bless you, God bless the United States Army, and God bless America.\" Again, three instances.\n\nResult [41] also includes the same closing line, confirming three uses of \"God.\" \n\nResult [64] has a transcript where Trump says, \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" That's another mention, but in the closing, he repeats the three \"God bless\" phrases. \n\nResult [66] is a video transcript where he again uses the three \"God bless\" phrases. \n\nMultiple sources consistently show Trump using \"God\" three times in his closing remarks. There's no conflicting information in the search results suggesting he didn't. All the transcripts and reports align on this. Therefore, the answer should resolve to \"Yes,\" which is p2.\n</think>\n\n**recommendation: p2**\n\n**Explanation:**  \nPresident Donald Trump's May 24, 2025, West Point commencement speech included **three explicit uses of the term \"God\"** in his closing remarks:  \n1. \"God bless you,\"  \n2. \"God bless the United States Army,\"  \n3. \"God bless America\" [2][29][41][66].  \n\nThese instances meet the criteria for pluralization/possessive forms and occurred during the main event. No ambiguity exists in the transcripts or video evidence provided.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.005, ID: 39369058607725624372816168715124733710044313216558575927665734684531256635840, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.995, ID: 91378906342400776905196881990868628249380099438544907636818900539991291312365, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for transcripts or mentions of Trump's speech. The search results include several sources, including news articles and video transcripts. Let's go through each one.\n\nLooking at result [1], the CBS News article mentions Trump's speech but doesn't quote him saying \"God.\" The focus is on military rebuilding and foreign policy. Result [2] from Politico also discusses the speech's political tone but no mention of religious terms. \n\nResult [3] is a YouTube transcript. Scanning through, Trump says, \"god bless the United States of America in your holy name I pray amen please be seated.\" That's one instance. \n\nResult [4] includes another transcript snippet where Trump says, \"god bless the United States of America.\" That's a second mention. \n\nResult [5] is a transcript from a 2020 speech, which isn't relevant here. Results [6] and [7] (Fox News and KTVN) don't mention \"God\" in the speech quotes provided. \n\nResult [8] from News 12 mentions Trump's advice but no religious references. Result [9] is a video description without specific quotes. \n\nResult [10] is Vice President Pence's 2019 speech, so not relevant. Result [11] is Trump's 2020 speech, also not applicable. \n\nResult [12] from The White House YouTube channel has a transcript where Trump says, \"God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America.\" That's two more instances, bringing the total to four. \n\nResult [13] is another transcript where Trump mentions building the Golden Dome but no \"God.\" Result [14] from PalmBeachPost doesn't include religious terms. Result [15] from mynbc15.com also doesn't mention \"God.\" \n\nResult [16] and [17] are video transcripts; [17] includes Trump saying, \"God bless you and protect you. And God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America.\" That's three instances in this segment.\n\nWait, but need to ensure these are all from the same 2025 speech. Some transcripts might be from different years. For example, result [12] is labeled 2025 and has two mentions. Result [17] from 2025 also has three. However, need to cross-check if these are from the same event. \n\nLooking at the dates: the event was on May 24, 2025. Results [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] all reference May 24 or 25, 2025. \n\nIn result [3], the transcript shows one \"God\" mention. Result [4] has another. Result [12] has two, and result [17] has three. However, some of these might be overlapping transcripts from the same speech. For example, result [12] and [17] could be different parts of the same address. \n\nAdding up the instances from the 2025 speeches: in result [3], one; result [4], one; result [12], two; result [17], three. But need to avoid double-counting if they're from the same speech. \n\nWait, result [12] is a White House transcript snippet: \"God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America.\" That's two mentions. Result [17] includes \"God bless you and protect you. And God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America.\" That's three mentions in one segment. \n\nIf these are from the same speech, that's three instances. However, the exact count needs verification. The user specified the main speech at the event, including Q&A. The resolution depends on the exact number of \"God\" mentions in that specific speech.\n\nFrom the available transcripts, it's clear Trump mentioned \"God\" at least three times. For example, in result [17], he says \"God bless you and protect you. And God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America.\" That's three instances. Additionally, other parts of the speech might have more, but based on the provided sources, three are confirmed. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

And God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America.\" That's three instances in this segment.\n\nWait, but need to ensure these are all from the same 2025 speech. Some transcripts might be from different years. For example, result [12] is labeled 2025 and has two mentions. Result [17] from 2025 also has three. However, need to cross-check if these are from the same event. \n\nLooking at the dates: the event was on May 24, 2025. Results [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] all reference May 24 or 25, 2025. \n\nIn result [3], the transcript shows one \"God\" mention. Result [4] has another. Result [12] has two, and result [17] has three. However, some of these might be overlapping transcripts from the same speech. For example, result [12] and [17] could be different parts of the same address. \n\nAdding up the instances from the 2025 speeches: in result [3], one; result [4], one; result [12], two; result [17], three. But need to avoid double-counting if they're from the same speech. \n\nWait, result [12] is a White House transcript snippet: \"God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America.\" That's two mentions. Result [17] includes \"God bless you and protect you. And God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America.\" That's three mentions in one segment. \n\nIf these are from the same speech, that's three instances. However, the exact count needs verification. The user specified the main speech at the event, including Q&A. The resolution depends on the exact number of \"God\" mentions in that specific speech.\n\nFrom the available transcripts, it's clear Trump mentioned \"God\" at least three times. For example, in result [17], he says \"God bless you and protect you. And God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America.\" That's three instances. Additionally, other parts of the speech might have more, but based on the provided sources, three are confirmed. \n\nTherefore, the market should resolve to \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.005, ID: 39369058607725624372816168715124733710044313216558575927665734684531256635840, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.995, ID: 91378906342400776905196881990868628249380099438544907636818900539991291312365, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748179565 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 13:26:05 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

Another transcript in search result 10 (The White House) includes the quote: \u201cGod bless you, God bless the United States Army, and God bless America.\u201d Again, three mentions.\n\nSearch result 38 (another White House transcript) repeats the same three \"God\" references. Additionally, search result 65 (Rev.com transcript) from the 2020 speech has multiple \"God\" mentions, but we need to confirm if the 2025 speech followed a similar structure. However, the 2025 transcripts clearly show the three uses in the closing remarks.\n\nSome sources like search result 16 (KTVN 2 News) mention Trump's comments on transgender soldiers and critical race theory but don't reference \"God.\" However, the key transcripts from the actual speech (results 4, 10, 38, 65) confirm the three instances. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes,\" resolving to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748179565 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 13:26:05 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"God\" three or more times during his West Point commencement speech on May 24, 2025. The resolution depends on the exact count of the term \"God\" in the specified context.\n\nFirst, I need to review the provided search results to find instances where Trump mentioned \"God.\" The search results include transcripts and articles about the speech. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at the transcripts from sources like Rev.com (search results 2, 14, 21, 37, 41, 65), the 2020 speech transcript shows Trump used \"God\" multiple times, but that's from a different year. The 2025 speech is covered in other sources. For example, in search result 1, Fox News mentions Trump's speech but doesn't quote \"God.\" Similarly, search result 3 from Politico describes the speech's political tone but doesn't mention religious references.\n\nSearch result 4 is a YouTube video transcript. Scanning through it, Trump says, \"God bless you, God bless the United States Army, and God bless America.\" That's three instances right there. Another transcript in search result 10 (The White House) includes the quote: \u201cGod bless you, God bless the United States Army, and God bless America.\u201d Again, three mentions.\n\nSearch result 38 (another White House transcript) repeats the same three \"God\" references. Additionally, search result 65 (Rev.com transcript) from the 2020 speech has multiple \"God\" mentions, but we need to confirm if the 2025 speech followed a similar structure. However, the 2025 transcripts clearly show the three uses in the closing remarks.\n\nSome sources like search result 16 (KTVN 2 News) mention Trump's comments on transgender soldiers and critical race theory but don't reference \"God.\" However, the key transcripts from the actual speech (results 4, 10, 38, 65) confirm the three instances. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes,\" resolving to p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.005, ID: 39369058607725624372816168715124733710044313216558575927665734684531256635840, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.995, ID: 91378906342400776905196881990868628249380099438544907636818900539991291312365, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"God\" three or more times during his West Point commencement speech on May 24, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if it's uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for transcripts or mentions of Trump's speech. The key sources here are the transcripts and videos from the event. Let's go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at search result [1], it's a transcript from Trump's 2020 West Point speech. Not relevant here since the event in question is 2025. Result [2] is a YouTube video titled \"President Trump Addresses the Army Academy's Class of 2025.\" The description mentions a speech on May 24, 2025. The transcript snippet includes Trump saying, \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" That's one instance of \"God.\"\n\nResult [3] is another video of the 2025 speech. The transcript snippet starts with Trump thanking the audience and congratulating the class. The provided text doesn't include the word \"God,\" but it's a partial transcript. Result [4] is a news article mentioning Trump's off-script remarks but doesn't quote \"God.\" Result [5] from the LA Times details the speech's content, focusing on military rebuilding and politics, but no mention of religious terms.\n\nResult [6] is a CSPAN transcript of the 2025 commencement. The transcript includes Trump's speech where he says, \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" That's the same as in [2], so another mention here. Wait, but is this a different source? It might be the same speech, so maybe that's two mentions in different sources but the same instance. Need to check if there are multiple instances.\n\nResult [7] is a 2020 speech, irrelevant. Result [8] from Politico discusses the speech's political aspects but doesn't mention \"God.\" Result [9] from CBS News also focuses on military rebuilding without religious references. Result [10] is a school district site, irrelevant. Result [11] from News12 mentions parts of the speech but not \"God.\" Result [12] is the 2020 speech again. Result [13] is about admissions, irrelevant. Result [14] is another video of the 2025 speech; the transcript snippet here doesn't include \"God.\" Result [15] from Fox News quotes Trump but not using \"God.\" Result [16] from Axios discusses policy points, no mention of \"God.\"\n\nWait, in the search results, the key mentions of \"God\" are in [2] and [6], but they might be the same speech. Let me verify. The transcript in [2] includes: \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" The CSPAN transcript in [6] has: \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" So that's the same line, counted once. Are there other instances?\n\nLooking at the full transcript in [6], the President's speech starts at 10:17 am. The line \"With the grace of God...\" is mentioned once. Are there other mentions? Let me check the full text. In the provided snippet, after that line, he continues talking about military achievements without further religious references. The other sources don't show additional uses. \n\nHowever, in the YouTube video description from [2], there's another part: \"the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way. Nothing will slow you down and nothing will ...\" which is similar to the 2020 speech in [1], but in the 2025 speech, the exact quote is \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" Only one instance here.\n\nWait, in the 2020 speech transcript [12], Trump says, \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" The 2025 speech in [2] and [6] uses the same phrase. So that's one mention. Are there any other mentions in the 2025 speech?\n\nLooking at the LA Times article [5], it quotes Trump saying, \"We're getting rid of distractions and we're focusing our military on its core mission: crushing America's adversaries, killing America's enemies and defending our great American flag like it has never been defended before.\" No mention of God there.\n\nThe Fox News article [15] quotes Trump: \"The job of the U.S. is not to host drag shows or transform foreign countries...\" Again, no religious terms. The Axios article [16] mentions Trump's focus on military build-up and anti-DEI policies, no \"God.\"\n\nSo based on the available sources, Trump used \"God\" once in the 2025 speech. The user's query requires three or more instances. Since the sources only show one occurrence, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user mentioned that previous responses returned p2 (Yes), so they want a recheck. \n\nWait, maybe I missed other instances. Let me go through each source again. \n\nIn [2], the transcript snippet includes: \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" That's one. \n\nIn [6], the CSPAN transcript at 10:17 am: same line. \n\nIn [14], another video transcript: \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" Same instance again. \n\nNo other mentions in other sources. Therefore, only one occurrence. \n\nBut the user's ancillary data says pluralization/possessive counts, but other forms don't. The word \"God\" is used once. Therefore, the count is 1, which is less than 3. The resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's previous response was p2, so maybe there's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, perhaps the transcripts are incomplete. The search results include multiple videos and articles, but without full transcripts, it's possible that \"God\" was mentioned more times. However, based on the provided data, only one instance is found. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in the speech, Trump said \"God\" more times. For example, in the 2020 speech [12], he used it once. If the 2025 speech followed a similar structure, maybe he used it again elsewhere. But the provided transcripts don't show that. \n\nGiven the available information, the answer should be p1 (No). However, the user's instruction says to consider the market's resolution conditions and check alternative sources. Since the previous attempt returned p2, perhaps there's a missing source. \n\nWait, looking at result [16], Axios mentions Trump's speech: \"Trump referenced his anti-DEI focus, bragging that he's 'liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings.'\" No mention of \"God.\" \n\nAnother angle: the user's resolution source is video of the event. If the available videos ([2], [3], [4], [14]) show the speech, but the transcripts only capture one instance, perhaps the actual video has more. However, without access to the full video, I can only rely on the provided transcripts and articles. \n\nGiven the evidence, the count is 1. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But the user's previous response was p2, so maybe there's an error. Alternatively, perhaps the user's initial analysis missed something. \n\nWait, in the CSPAN transcript [6], after the initial mention, does Trump say \"God\" again? Let me check the full text provided. \n\nIn [6], the transcript continues: \n\n\"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way. Nothing will slow you down and nothing will ...\"\n\nThen later, Trump says: \n\n\"every cadet on the field before me should savor this morning. this is a day you will never, ever forget. in a few moments you will become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history. you will become officers in the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known. and i know, because i rebuilt that army, and i rebuilt the military. and we rebuilt it like nobody has ever rebuilt it before in my first term.\"\n\nNo further mentions of \"God.\" \n\nAnother part: \n\n\"thank your parents, your grandparents and family members who made this all possible for you. thank you. [applause] i think they must have done something right based on what i'm looking at.\"\n\nStill no. \n\nIn the Axios article [16], Trump is quoted: \"You have to watch what we're doing on trade,\" but no \"God.\" \n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, only one instance. The answer should be p1. However, the user's previous response was p2, so maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the initial analysis missed instances. \n\nWait, in the YouTube video description from [2], the transcript snippet includes: \n\n\"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way. Nothing will slow you down and nothing will ...\"\n\nAnd later: \n\n\"our enemies are very unhappy about it You've been hearing you've been reading Why are they doing that why well we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time That's why we're doing it We're also restoring the fundamental principle that a central purpose of our military is to protect our own borders from invasion...\"\n\nNo additional mentions. \n\nIn the Fox News article [15], Trump is quoted: \"You are winners every single one of you. Today I can proudly say mission accomplished, great job.\" No \"God.\" \n\nGiven all this, the conclusion is that \"God\" was mentioned once. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). But the user says previous response was p2. Maybe the initial analysis counted the 2020 speech, but the query is about 2025. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's initial response considered the 2020 speech, which is irrelevant. The current query is specifically about the 2025 event. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p1 (No), as only one instance is found in the 2025 speech based on provided sources.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748179565 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 13:26:05 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

The user wants to know if Donald Trump said the word \"God\" three or more times during his West Point commencement speech on May 24, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" (p2) if he did, \"No\" (p1) if not, and p3 if it's uncertain.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for transcripts or mentions of Trump's speech. The key sources here are the transcripts and videos from the event. Let's go through each relevant source.\n\nLooking at search result [1], it's a transcript from Trump's 2020 West Point speech. Not relevant here since the event in question is 2025. Result [2] is a YouTube video titled \"President Trump Addresses the Army Academy's Class of 2025.\" The description mentions a speech on May 24, 2025. The transcript snippet includes Trump saying, \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" That's one instance of \"God.\"\n\nResult [3] is another video of the 2025 speech. The transcript snippet starts with Trump thanking the audience and congratulating the class. The provided text doesn't include the word \"God,\" but it's a partial transcript. Result [4] is a news article mentioning Trump's off-script remarks but doesn't quote \"God.\" Result [5] from the LA Times details the speech's content, focusing on military rebuilding and politics, but no mention of religious terms.\n\nResult [6] is a CSPAN transcript of the 2025 commencement. The transcript includes Trump's speech where he says, \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" That's the same as in [2], so another mention here. Wait, but is this a different source? It might be the same speech, so maybe that's two mentions in different sources but the same instance. Need to check if there are multiple instances.\n\nResult [7] is a 2020 speech, irrelevant. Result [8] from Politico discusses the speech's political aspects but doesn't mention \"God.\" Result [9] from CBS News also focuses on military rebuilding without religious references. Result [10] is a school district site, irrelevant. Result [11] from News12 mentions parts of the speech but not \"God.\" Result [12] is the 2020 speech again. Result [13] is about admissions, irrelevant. Result [14] is another video of the 2025 speech; the transcript snippet here doesn't include \"God.\" Result [15] from Fox News quotes Trump but not using \"God.\" Result [16] from Axios discusses policy points, no mention of \"God.\"\n\nWait, in the search results, the key mentions of \"God\" are in [2] and [6], but they might be the same speech. Let me verify. The transcript in [2] includes: \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" The CSPAN transcript in [6] has: \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" So that's the same line, counted once. Are there other instances?\n\nLooking at the full transcript in [6], the President's speech starts at 10:17 am. The line \"With the grace of God...\" is mentioned once. Are there other mentions? Let me check the full text. In the provided snippet, after that line, he continues talking about military achievements without further religious references. The other sources don't show additional uses. \n\nHowever, in the YouTube video description from [2], there's another part: \"the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way. Nothing will slow you down and nothing will ...\" which is similar to the 2020 speech in [1], but in the 2025 speech, the exact quote is \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" Only one instance here.\n\nWait, in the 2020 speech transcript [12], Trump says, \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" The 2025 speech in [2] and [6] uses the same phrase. So that's one mention. Are there any other mentions in the 2025 speech?\n\nLooking at the LA Times article [5], it quotes Trump saying, \"We're getting rid of distractions and we're focusing our military on its core mission: crushing America's adversaries, killing America's enemies and defending our great American flag like it has never been defended before.\" No mention of God there.\n\nThe Fox News article [15] quotes Trump: \"The job of the U.S. is not to host drag shows or transform foreign countries...\" Again, no religious terms. The Axios article [16] mentions Trump's focus on military build-up and anti-DEI policies, no \"God.\"\n\nSo based on the available sources, Trump used \"God\" once in the 2025 speech. The user's query requires three or more instances. Since the sources only show one occurrence, the answer should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user mentioned that previous responses returned p2 (Yes), so they want a recheck. \n\nWait, maybe I missed other instances. Let me go through each source again. \n\nIn [2], the transcript snippet includes: \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" That's one. \n\nIn [6], the CSPAN transcript at 10:17 am: same line. \n\nIn [14], another video transcript: \"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail.\" Same instance again. \n\nNo other mentions in other sources. Therefore, only one occurrence. \n\nBut the user's ancillary data says pluralization/possessive counts, but other forms don't. The word \"God\" is used once. Therefore, the count is 1, which is less than 3. The resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's previous response was p2, so maybe there's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, perhaps the transcripts are incomplete.

But the user's previous response was p2, so maybe there's an error. Alternatively, perhaps the user's initial analysis missed something. \n\nWait, in the CSPAN transcript [6], after the initial mention, does Trump say \"God\" again? Let me check the full text provided. \n\nIn [6], the transcript continues: \n\n\"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way. Nothing will slow you down and nothing will ...\"\n\nThen later, Trump says: \n\n\"every cadet on the field before me should savor this morning. this is a day you will never, ever forget. in a few moments you will become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history. you will become officers in the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known. and i know, because i rebuilt that army, and i rebuilt the military. and we rebuilt it like nobody has ever rebuilt it before in my first term.\"\n\nNo further mentions of \"God.\" \n\nAnother part: \n\n\"thank your parents, your grandparents and family members who made this all possible for you. thank you. [applause] i think they must have done something right based on what i'm looking at.\"\n\nStill no. \n\nIn the Axios article [16], Trump is quoted: \"You have to watch what we're doing on trade,\" but no \"God.\" \n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, only one instance. The answer should be p1. However, the user's previous response was p2, so maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the initial analysis missed instances. \n\nWait, in the YouTube video description from [2], the transcript snippet includes: \n\n\"With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way. Nothing will slow you down and nothing will ...\"\n\nAnd later: \n\n\"our enemies are very unhappy about it You've been hearing you've been reading Why are they doing that why well we're doing it because we want to be around for a long time That's why we're doing it We're also restoring the fundamental principle that a central purpose of our military is to protect our own borders from invasion...\"\n\nNo additional mentions. \n\nIn the Fox News article [15], Trump is quoted: \"You are winners every single one of you. Today I can proudly say mission accomplished, great job.\" No \"God.\" \n\nGiven all this, the conclusion is that \"God\" was mentioned once. Therefore, the market should resolve to \"No\" (p1). But the user says previous response was p2. Maybe the initial analysis counted the 2020 speech, but the query is about 2025. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's initial response considered the 2020 speech, which is irrelevant. The current query is specifically about the 2025 event. \n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is p1 (No), as only one instance is found in the 2025 speech based on provided sources.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.005, ID: 39369058607725624372816168715124733710044313216558575927665734684531256635840, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.995, ID: 91378906342400776905196881990868628249380099438544907636818900539991291312365, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors NO outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
