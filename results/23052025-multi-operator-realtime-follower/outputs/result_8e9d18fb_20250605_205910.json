      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of a CS2 match between Chinggis Warriors and Lynn Vision at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 Stage 1. The match is scheduled for June 5, 2025, at 1:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins this specific round 4 match.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is June 5, 2025, 8:55 PM UTC. The match is set for 1:30 PM ET, which is 5:30 PM UTC. Since the current time is past the match time, the event should have already occurred. However, I need to verify if the match took place as scheduled and what the result was.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. Search result [5] from Dust2.us provides statistics and analysis, indicating Lynn Vision is the favorite. Result [6] on Liquipedia's head-to-head shows Lynn Vision has won 2 out of 3 past encounters. Result [9] from egamersworld.com states that the match is part of the Stage 1 round 4 and lists Lynn Vision as the bookmaker favorite with 1.36 odds. Result [12] on Tips.gg shows 92% of experts predict a Lynn Vision win.\n\nHowever, the critical piece is the official result. Search result [7] from Liquipedia's Stage 1 page doesn't list the specific match result yet, but result [13] is a YouTube video titled \"Chinggis Warriors vs Legacy - BLAST Austin Major 2025 Stage 1\" uploaded on June 4, 2025. The description mentions \"Chinggis Warriors fall in regulation 23 rounds of play,\" but this is against Legacy, not Lynn Vision. There's no direct mention of the Chinggis vs Lynn Vision match result in the provided sources.\n\nThe resolution source specified is HLTV.org (result [14]), but the provided HLTV link doesn't show the specific match result. Without an official update from HLTV or another primary source confirming the outcome, I can't definitively resolve the market. The user's personalization instructions state that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the instructions also say if the event date is in the past but no info is available, default to p4. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 50-50 for ties, cancellations, or delays. Since the match was supposed to happen today and there's no result, it's unclear if it was delayed or just not reported yet. Given the uncertainty and lack of official confirmation, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749156912 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 20:55:12 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market based on the outcome of a CS2 match between Chinggis Warriors and Lynn Vision at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 Stage 1. The match is scheduled for June 5, 2025, at 1:30 PM ET. The resolution depends on who wins this specific round 4 match.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The provided timestamp is June 5, 2025, 8:55 PM UTC. The match is set for 1:30 PM ET, which is 5:30 PM UTC. Since the current time is past the match time, the event should have already occurred. However, I need to verify if the match took place as scheduled and what the result was.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the match. Search result [5] from Dust2.us provides statistics and analysis, indicating Lynn Vision is the favorite. Result [6] on Liquipedia's head-to-head shows Lynn Vision has won 2 out of 3 past encounters. Result [9] from egamersworld.com states that the match is part of the Stage 1 round 4 and lists Lynn Vision as the bookmaker favorite with 1.36 odds. Result [12] on Tips.gg shows 92% of experts predict a Lynn Vision win.\n\nHowever, the critical piece is the official result. Search result [7] from Liquipedia's Stage 1 page doesn't list the specific match result yet, but result [13] is a YouTube video titled \"Chinggis Warriors vs Legacy - BLAST Austin Major 2025 Stage 1\" uploaded on June 4, 2025. The description mentions \"Chinggis Warriors fall in regulation 23 rounds of play,\" but this is against Legacy, not Lynn Vision. There's no direct mention of the Chinggis vs Lynn Vision match result in the provided sources.\n\nThe resolution source specified is HLTV.org (result [14]), but the provided HLTV link doesn't show the specific match result. Without an official update from HLTV or another primary source confirming the outcome, I can't definitively resolve the market. The user's personalization instructions state that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the instructions also say if the event date is in the past but no info is available, default to p4. But the ancillary data defines p3 as 50-50 for ties, cancellations, or delays. Since the match was supposed to happen today and there's no result, it's unclear if it was delayed or just not reported yet. Given the uncertainty and lack of official confirmation, the safest resolution is p3 (50-50).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Chinggis Warriors, Price: 0.245, ID: 17007435039160393056684547220125326418276461719469910699341506389368286159579, Winner: No\n- Token: Lynn Vision, Price: 0.755, ID: 63711334587246372000248766401913906564034685541038642059338533058370449988088, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Lynn Vision, p2 to Chinggis Warriors, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Lynn Vision, p2 = Chinggis Warriors\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Lynn Vision outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.755 = 75.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Given that the user's ancillary data defines p1 as Lynn Vision and the match date is in the past (June 5, 2025), and assuming no contradictory info from HLTV, the most probable outcome based on the provided sources is Lynn Vision's victory. Since the resolution source is HLTV, but it's not explicitly provided in the search results, I have to rely on the available data which points to Lynn Vision winning. Therefore, the recommendation should be p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Chinggis Warriors, Price: 0.245, ID: 17007435039160393056684547220125326418276461719469910699341506389368286159579, Winner: No\n- Token: Lynn Vision, Price: 0.755, ID: 63711334587246372000248766401913906564034685541038642059338533058370449988088, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Lynn Vision, p2 to Chinggis Warriors, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Lynn Vision, p2 = Chinggis Warriors\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Lynn Vision outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.755 = 75.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
