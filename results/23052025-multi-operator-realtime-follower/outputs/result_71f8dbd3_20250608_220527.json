      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MIBR vs. BetBoom match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 Stage 2. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is 2025-06-08 22:00:52 UTC, which is June 8, 2025, at 10 PM UTC. The match in question is scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 3:50 PM CDT (as per source [4]), which converts to 8:50 PM UTC. Since the current time is 10 PM UTC, the match has already concluded. So, it's not a future event anymore.\n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find the match outcome. Source [12] mentions that HEROIC defeated BetBoom in Stage 2, pushing BetBoom to the 0-2 pool. However, this is a different match (BetBoom vs. HEROIC), not the MIBR vs. BetBoom one. \n\nSource [4] provides details about the MIBR vs. BetBoom match, including the maps picked (Train, Anubis, Nuke) and the lineups. Source [6] lists the match as happening on 08.06.2025 at 20:00 UTC (which is 3:50 PM CDT, aligning with [4]). The FAQ in [6] states that the head-to-head record is 2-2, but that's historical data, not the current match result.\n\nSource [13] has a detailed scorecard for the MIBR vs. BetBoom match on Map 1 (de_train), showing MIBR won 13-11. However, the match is a BO3, so I need to check if there are results for the other maps. The search results don't provide info on Maps 2 and 3. Without complete information on all maps, it's unclear if MIBR secured the BO3 win. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that the source is HLTV. Checking source [2], which is HLTV's coverage hub, there's no direct mention of the MIBR vs. BetBoom result. Source [9] (HLTV's MIBR team page) shows recent matches up to June 7, 2024, but nothing for 2025. \n\nSince the match occurred on the same day as the current timestamp, and the only available data is Map 1's result, but the BO3 outcome isn't fully reported in the provided sources, there's insufficient verified information. According to the ancillary data, if the outcome can't be verified, it should resolve to p3 (50-50). However, the user instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But without complete data, it's safer to default to p4. Wait, the resolution conditions here have p3 as 0.5 (tie/canceled), and the market resolves to 50-50 if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28. Since the match happened on time but the full result isn't available in the sources, it's unclear. However, source [13] shows MIBR won Map 1, but without Maps 2 and 3, we can't confirm the BO3 outcome. Therefore, the result isn't verifiable through the provided sources, leading to a p3 resolution.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749420052 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-08 22:00:52 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MIBR vs. BetBoom match at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 Stage 2. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is 2025-06-08 22:00:52 UTC, which is June 8, 2025, at 10 PM UTC. The match in question is scheduled for June 8, 2025, at 3:50 PM CDT (as per source [4]), which converts to 8:50 PM UTC. Since the current time is 10 PM UTC, the match has already concluded. So, it's not a future event anymore.\n\nNext, I'll look through the search results to find the match outcome. Source [12] mentions that HEROIC defeated BetBoom in Stage 2, pushing BetBoom to the 0-2 pool. However, this is a different match (BetBoom vs. HEROIC), not the MIBR vs. BetBoom one. \n\nSource [4] provides details about the MIBR vs. BetBoom match, including the maps picked (Train, Anubis, Nuke) and the lineups. Source [6] lists the match as happening on 08.06.2025 at 20:00 UTC (which is 3:50 PM CDT, aligning with [4]). The FAQ in [6] states that the head-to-head record is 2-2, but that's historical data, not the current match result.\n\nSource [13] has a detailed scorecard for the MIBR vs. BetBoom match on Map 1 (de_train), showing MIBR won 13-11. However, the match is a BO3, so I need to check if there are results for the other maps. The search results don't provide info on Maps 2 and 3. Without complete information on all maps, it's unclear if MIBR secured the BO3 win. \n\nThe resolution conditions state that the source is HLTV. Checking source [2], which is HLTV's coverage hub, there's no direct mention of the MIBR vs. BetBoom result. Source [9] (HLTV's MIBR team page) shows recent matches up to June 7, 2024, but nothing for 2025. \n\nSince the match occurred on the same day as the current timestamp, and the only available data is Map 1's result, but the BO3 outcome isn't fully reported in the provided sources, there's insufficient verified information. According to the ancillary data, if the outcome can't be verified, it should resolve to p3 (50-50). However, the user instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. But without complete data, it's safer to default to p4. Wait, the resolution conditions here have p3 as 0.5 (tie/canceled), and the market resolves to 50-50 if the match is tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28. Since the match happened on time but the full result isn't available in the sources, it's unclear. However, source [13] shows MIBR won Map 1, but without Maps 2 and 3, we can't confirm the BO3 outcome. Therefore, the result isn't verifiable through the provided sources, leading to a p3 resolution.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p3\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: MIBR, Price: 0.5, ID: 108300411504760767758594977694373534261933609982004530910943475767866510315008, Winner: No\n- Token: BetBoom, Price: 0.5, ID: 48714431327739209782721848150746830192154632102723772062529810589384847334832, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to BetBoom, p2 to MIBR, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = BetBoom, p2 = MIBR\n\nInterpretation: Market slightly favors MIBR (maps to p2 in resolution conditions), but not decisively (0.500 vs 0.500)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
