The match is scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET (which is 11:30 PM UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). Therefore, the match has already started (or just finished) at the current time.\n\nWe are to determine the outcome of the match based on the provided search results. Since the match is recent, we must rely on the latest available information.\n\nReviewing the search results:\n\n[1] and [2] provide general information about the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, including dates and prize pool, but no specific match results.\n\n[3] (Strafe.com) is a preview of the match, dated June 19, 2025, but does not contain the result. It states the match is scheduled for 7:00 PM (likely local time, which is CDT, UTC-5). The current time in the system is 23:19 UTC, which is 18:19 CDT (if Austin is in CDT). So the match would have started at 7:00 PM CDT (which is 00:00 UTC on June 20). However, the system time is June 19, 23:19 UTC, which is before the match (if 7:00 PM CDT is 00:00 UTC). But note the query says 7:30 PM ET, which is 23:30 UTC. So at the current system time (23:19 UTC), the match has not started (it starts in 11 minutes). However, the search results do not have the result because the match hasn't happened yet.\n\nBut wait, the system prompt says the current timestamp is 1750375181 (2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC). The match is scheduled for 7:30 PM ET on June 19, 2025. 7:30 PM ET is 23:30 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). So at 23:19 UTC, the match has not started.\n\nHowever, we have search results that are dated June 19 and later. For example:\n\n[4] is a YouTube video titled \"BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, Quarter-Finals, Day 1\" and in the description it lists the matches for the day, including Team Spirit vs. MOUZ at 14:00 CDT (which is 19:00 UTC). But the system time is 23:19 UTC, which is after 19:00 UTC. So the match should have been played.\n\nBut the search result [4] is a video that was published on June 17, 2025, and it is a stream of the event. It does not contain the result.\n\n[5] (bo3.gg) is a prediction article dated June 18, 2025, predicting Spirit to win 2-1. It is not a result.\n\n[6] (egamersworld) is a match page for Team Spirit vs MOUZ, dated June 19, 2025, but it does not show the result.

Since the match was scheduled for a time that has already passed (at the system time), and we don't have a result, we must consider the possibility that the result is not available in the provided sources.\n\nHowever, the query requires us to resolve the market. We must base our resolution on the available information.\n\nGiven that the match was scheduled for June 19, 2025, and the current time is June 19, 2025, 23:19 UTC (which is after the scheduled start time of 23:30 UTC for 7:30 PM ET), and we have no result in the search results, we must check if the event was postponed or canceled.\n\nThe ancillary data says: \"If the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025, this market will resolve to 50-50.\" Since the match was scheduled for today and we have no information about postponement or cancellation, and the delay (if any) has not extended beyond June 28, we cannot assume it is delayed beyond June 28 at this point.\n\nBut note: the system time is June 19, 23:19 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 23:30 UTC. So at the system time, the match has not started (it is 11 minutes before the scheduled start). Therefore, the match has not been played yet. Since the market is about an event that has not occurred, we must return p4 (cannot be resolved at this time) as per the personalization instructions.\n\nHowever, the personalization instructions state: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" \n\nBut note: the system time is 23:19 UTC and the match is at 23:30 UTC. So it is still in the future. Therefore, we must return p4.\n\nBut wait, the query says the match is on June 19, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET, which is 23:30 UTC. The system time is 23:19 UTC on June 19, 2025. So the match is 11 minutes in the future. Therefore, the event has not occurred.\n\nTherefore, we must return p4.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the time zones. The query says 7:30 PM ET. ET could be Eastern Time, which is UTC-4 during daylight saving time. So 7:30 PM ET = 23:30 UTC. The system time is 23:19 UTC, so it is 11 minutes before the match.\n\nTherefore, the event is in the future. We cannot resolve it now.\n\nBut note: the personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4\". So we must return p4.\n\nHowever, the system prompt also says: \"If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution.\"\n\nSince the event has not occurred (it is 11 minutes in the future), we return p4.\n\nBut note: the personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user prompt does not contain a URL, so we use the provided search results.\n\nThe search results do not contain the result because the match hasn't happened. Therefore, we must return p4.\n\nConclusion: The match has not been played yet (it is scheduled for 11 minutes from the current system time). Therefore, we cannot resolve the outcome and must return p4.\n\nBut note: the personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" \n\nHowever, the event date is today (June 19) and the time is in the future relative to the system time. So it is not in the past. Therefore, we do not use the most probable outcome.\n\nTherefore, we return p4.\n\nBut note: the system time is 23:19 UTC and the match is at 23:30 UTC. So it is in the future.\n\nFinal decision: Since the event is scheduled for a future time (relative to the current timestamp), we return p4.\n</think>\nBased on the provided search results and the current timestamp of 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC, the quarterfinal match between Team Spirit and MOUZ at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 has not yet concluded. The match is scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 19:00 UTC (7:00 PM CDT)[3][4][13][18][24][29][33][40][44][47], which is 4 hours and 19 minutes after the current system time.

Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375181 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about the outcome of a specific esports match: Team Spirit vs MOUZ in the quarterfinals of the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET.\n\nThe ancillary data specifies:\n- The market will resolve to \"Spirit\" (p2) if Spirit wins.\n- The market will resolve to \"MOUZ\" (p1) if MOUZ wins.\n- If the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it resolves to 50-50 (p3).\n\nThe current date and time is Thursday, June 19, 2025, 11:21:16 PM UTC (as per the system prompt). The match is scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET (which is 11:30 PM UTC, since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). Therefore, the match has already started (or just finished) at the current time.\n\nWe are to determine the outcome of the match based on the provided search results. Since the match is recent, we must rely on the latest available information.\n\nReviewing the search results:\n\n[1] and [2] provide general information about the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, including dates and prize pool, but no specific match results.\n\n[3] (Strafe.com) is a preview of the match, dated June 19, 2025, but does not contain the result. It states the match is scheduled for 7:00 PM (likely local time, which is CDT, UTC-5). The current time in the system is 23:19 UTC, which is 18:19 CDT (if Austin is in CDT). So the match would have started at 7:00 PM CDT (which is 00:00 UTC on June 20). However, the system time is June 19, 23:19 UTC, which is before the match (if 7:00 PM CDT is 00:00 UTC). But note the query says 7:30 PM ET, which is 23:30 UTC. So at the current system time (23:19 UTC), the match has not started (it starts in 11 minutes). However, the search results do not have the result because the match hasn't happened yet.\n\nBut wait, the system prompt says the current timestamp is 1750375181 (2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC). The match is scheduled for 7:30 PM ET on June 19, 2025. 7:30 PM ET is 23:30 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). So at 23:19 UTC, the match has not started.\n\nHowever, we have search results that are dated June 19 and later. For example:\n\n[4] is a YouTube video titled \"BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025, Quarter-Finals, Day 1\" and in the description it lists the matches for the day, including Team Spirit vs. MOUZ at 14:00 CDT (which is 19:00 UTC). But the system time is 23:19 UTC, which is after 19:00 UTC. So the match should have been played.\n\nBut the search result [4] is a video that was published on June 17, 2025, and it is a stream of the event. It does not contain the result.\n\n[5] (bo3.gg) is a prediction article dated June 18, 2025, predicting Spirit to win 2-1. It is not a result.\n\n[6] (egamersworld) is a match page for Team Spirit vs MOUZ, dated June 19, 2025, but it does not show the result. It says the match is at 15:00 (which is likely UTC) and the current system time is 23:19 UTC, so it should have been played.

Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = MOUZ, p2 = Spirit\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors MOUZ outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.710 = 71.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3.

      "response": "<think>\nWe are given a query about resolving a market for the outcome of a specific esports match between Team Spirit and MOUZ in the quarterfinals of the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. The match is scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are:\n- p1: MOUZ wins\n- p2: Spirit wins\n- p3: Tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025 (resolves to 50-50)\n\nWe are to determine the outcome of the match based on the provided search results and the current date (June 19, 2025, 23:19:41 UTC). Note that the match time is 7:30 PM ET, which is 23:30 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). Therefore, at the current time (23:19 UTC), the match has not yet started (it is scheduled to start in about 11 minutes).\n\nHowever, the search results do not contain any information about the outcome of the match because it hasn't happened yet. The search results are from before the match, including previews, predictions, and schedules.\n\nGiven the instructions in the personalization section:\n- We must base our resolution on verifiable facts about events that have already occurred.\n- If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, we must return p4 (which in this context is not defined, but the instruction says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\"\n- The current time is 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC, and the match is scheduled for 23:30 UTC on the same day (which is in the future).\n\nTherefore, we must return p4 because the event has not occurred yet.\n\nBut note: the personalization section also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user provided a URL for HLTV (https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025) as the resolution source. However, in the search results, we do not have a direct capture of that page at the time after the match. The provided search results [2] and [4] are from HLTV but do not show the result of this specific match.\n\nMoreover, the search results [1], [12], [15], [19], [23], [29], [34], [39], [42], [45] are all from a YouTube video that is a live stream of the quarterfinals day 1, which includes the Spirit vs MOUZ match. However, these are the description of the stream before it started. We don't have the actual stream content.\n\nGiven that the match has not started and we have no results, we must return p4.\n\nHowever, note that the personalization section also says: \"If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" So even though it's the same day, it's in the future.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p4.\n\nBut note: the user's query says: \"If the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025, this market will resolve to 50-50.\" However, at the current time, the match is not delayed beyond June 28, 2025 (it's still June 19). It's just that the match hasn't started yet.\n\nSo, we must return p4.\n\nHowever, the personalization section also says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\nBut in this case, we have no data about the outcome because the event hasn't occurred. Therefore, we must stick with p4.\n\nBut let's check the search results again for any real-time update. The search results [26] (from esports.gg) has a live score section that says:\n  Spirit 1:0 MOUZ \u2014 Live score\n  Game 1: Mirage, MOUZ pick: Spirit 25:21 MOUZ\n  Game 2: Dust II, Spirit pick: Spirit 0:0 MOUZ\n  Game 3: Nuke, Decider: Spirit 0:0 MOUZ\n\nThis suggests that the match is ongoing and the first map (Mirage) has been won by Spirit in overtime (25:21). However, note that the current time is 23:19 UTC and the match started at 23:30 UTC? That doesn't align. Also, the source [26] is from esports.gg and the article is dated 2025-06-19. But without knowing the exact time of the article, we cannot be sure.\n\nHowever, the search result [26] is titled: \"Spirit battle MOUZ in Austin for a chance to keep their CS2 Major crown\" and includes a live score. This indicates that the match is in progress. But note: the current time in the system is 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 23:30 UTC. So it's 11 minutes before the scheduled start. How can there be a live score?\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the live score might be from a different match or a mistake. Alternatively, the time zones might be off. The match was scheduled for 14:00 CDT (Central Daylight Time), which is UTC-5. So 14:00 CDT is 19:00 UTC. Therefore, the match should have started at 19:00 UTC and by 23:19 UTC, it would be over 4 hours later, which is plenty of time for the match to have been played.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- The match was scheduled for 14:00 CDT (Central Daylight Time). CDT is UTC-5.\n- 14:00 CDT = 19:00 UTC (14:00 + 5 hours = 19:00 UTC).\n- The current time is 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC, which is 4 hours and 19 minutes after the scheduled start.\n\nTherefore, the match should have already been played.\n\nNow, looking at the search results, we have [26] (esports.gg) reporting a live score for the match. It says:\n  Spirit 1:0 MOUZ \u2014 Live score\n  Game 1: Mirage, MOUZ pick: Spirit 25:21 MOUZ\n  Game 2: Dust II, Spirit pick: Spirit 0:0 MOUZ (which means it hasn't started or in progress)\n  Game 3: Not started.\n\nBut note: the article says \"Live score\", meaning it was updated in real-time. However, we don't have the full result because the match might still be ongoing. But the current time is 23:19 UTC, which is after the scheduled start, so we can look for a final result.\n\nWe also have search result [36] (HLTV matches page) which shows the result of the match? But the content of [36] is a generic page about the Austin Major matches, and it lists some matches but not necessarily the Spirit vs MOUZ result.\n\nLooking at [36]: \n  \"Vitality. Vitality. 3 : 13. Legacy \u00b7 MOUZ. MOUZ. 11 : 13. Virtus.pro \u00b7 Spirit. Spirit. 13 : 3. paiN \u00b7 G2.\"\n\nThis seems to be a list of results, but it doesn't show the Spirit vs MOUZ match. It shows MOUZ lost to Virtus.pro (11:13) and Spirit beat paiN (13:3). But these are not the quarterfinal match.\n\nThe quarterfinal match between Spirit and MOUZ is not listed in the provided snippet of [36].\n\nWe have another source: [26] (esports.gg) which reports the first map as won by Spirit. But we don't have the final result.\n\nHowever, note that the search results also include [27] (Strafe) which is a preview and prediction, not a result.\n\nGiven the time, the match should be over. But we don't have a verifiable source that reports the final result. The HLTV page (which is the official source per the query) is not provided in the search results with the result.\n\nTherefore, we cannot verify the outcome. However, the personalization section says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nBut note: the event date is today (June 19) and the current time is 23:19 UTC, which is after the scheduled start (19:00 UTC). So the event is in the past. However, we don't have a result.\n\nBut we have a live update from [26] that shows Spirit won the first map. But we don't have the full result.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the YouTube stream [1] and others, but they are the description of the stream before it started.\n\nGiven the lack of a verifiable final result, and the fact that the market resolution requires an official source (HLTV) which we don't have in the search results, we must rely on the available information.\n\nBut note: the query says the resolution source is HLTV. We don't have the HLTV page for the match. Therefore, we cannot verify.\n\nHowever, the personalization section says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user provided the HLTV event page. But we don't have that page in the search results. We have [2] and [4] from HLTV, but they are not the specific match page.\n\nTherefore, we are unable to get the result from the specified source.\n\nGiven the above, and the fact that we have a live update from [26] (which is not the official source) showing Spirit leading 1-0, but not the final result, we cannot definitively say the outcome.\n\nBut note: the market resolution conditions say that if the match is delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it resolves to 50-50. But the match is not delayed beyond June 28; it was played today. We just don't have the result.\n\nThis is a dilemma. However, the instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt.\"\n\nBut we have some information: the first map was won by Spirit. And the predictions (from multiple sources) favored Spirit to win. But that is not a fact.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the match is part of a tournament and must have been played. But without the result, we cannot resolve.\n\nGiven the instructions, we must return p4 if we cannot resolve. But the event has occurred (it's in the past) and we don't have the result. The personalization section does not have a provision for this exact scenario.\n\nHowever, the instruction says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data (resolution conditions) does not provide a \"most probable outcome\", but the user prompt does say that the market will resolve to 50-50 only in case of tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 28. Since the match was played (we assume) and not delayed beyond June 28, then we should not use p3.\n\nBut we don't have the result. Therefore, we are stuck.\n\nGiven the complexity, and the fact that we are an oracle, we must be cautious. The safest is to return p4 because we don't have a verifiable result from the official source.\n\nBut note: the personalization section says: \"ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time\" for future events. But this event is in the past. However, we don't have the result.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for any source in the search results that gives the final result. Let's review:\n\n- [26] (esports.gg) gives a live score that shows Spirit won the first map and the second map hasn't started. This is incomplete.\n\n- No other search result provides the result.\n\nTherefore, we cannot verify the outcome.\n\nGiven the above, and the instruction to return p4 if we cannot resolve, we return p4.\n\nBut note: the additional instruction says: \"Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\" We have checked, and there is no alternative data source in the provided search results that gives the final result.\n\nTherefore, we must return p4.\n\nHowever, let's note that the match was played and we have a partial result. But without the full result, we cannot determine the winner.\n\nAlternatively, we can assume that the match was played to completion and look for the most probable outcome. But the instructions require verifiable facts.\n\nGiven the requirement for verifiable facts, and the absence of the official result, we must return p4.\n\nBut wait: the current time is 23:19 UTC on June 19, and the match started at 19:00 UTC. It's been over 4 hours. A best-of-three match typically takes 2-3 hours. So it should be over. But we don't have the result in the search results.\n\nThis is a data gap. Therefore, we return p4.\n\nHowever, the user's query specifies the resolution source as HLTV. We don't have that page. So we cannot verify.\n\nConclusion: We return p4.\n\nBut note: the market resolution conditions in the query say that if the match is delayed beyond June 28, it resolves to 50-50. But it's not delayed beyond June 28. It was played on June 19. So we cannot use p3.\n\nTherefore, we must return p4.\n\nFinal recommendation: p4\n</think>\n### Recommendation: p4\n\nThe BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 quarterfinal match between Team Spirit and MOUZ was scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 19:00 UTC (14:00 CDT). As of the current timestamp (2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC), the match has not yet concluded, and no verifiable outcome is available in the provided sources. The search results include previews, predictions, and live-streaming announcements but lack official confirmation of the match result from the designated resolution source (HLTV). \n\nPer the resolution conditions:\n- The event date (June 19) is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but the match occurred later on the same day (scheduled for 19:00 UTC, 4 hours before the current time). \n- No sources confirm cancellation, postponement beyond June 28, or a final result. \n- The ancillary data specifies resolution to p3 (50-50) only if the match is \"tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025,\" which does not apply here.\n\nSince the outcome cannot be verified from official sources (HLTV) or the provided data, the recommendation remains **p4** (cannot be resolved at this time).",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375181 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nWe are given a query about resolving a market for the outcome of a specific esports match between Team Spirit and MOUZ in the quarterfinals of the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. The match is scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. The resolution conditions are:\n- p1: MOUZ wins\n- p2: Spirit wins\n- p3: Tie, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025 (resolves to 50-50)\n\nWe are to determine the outcome of the match based on the provided search results and the current date (June 19, 2025, 23:19:41 UTC). Note that the match time is 7:30 PM ET, which is 23:30 UTC (since ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time). Therefore, at the current time (23:19 UTC), the match has not yet started (it is scheduled to start in about 11 minutes).\n\nHowever, the search results do not contain any information about the outcome of the match because it hasn't happened yet. The search results are from before the match, including previews, predictions, and schedules.\n\nGiven the instructions in the personalization section:\n- We must base our resolution on verifiable facts about events that have already occurred.\n- If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, we must return p4 (which in this context is not defined, but the instruction says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\"\n- The current time is 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC, and the match is scheduled for 23:30 UTC on the same day (which is in the future).\n\nTherefore, we must return p4 because the event has not occurred yet.\n\nBut note: the personalization section also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user provided a URL for HLTV (https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025) as the resolution source. However, in the search results, we do not have a direct capture of that page at the time after the match. The provided search results [2] and [4] are from HLTV but do not show the result of this specific match.\n\nMoreover, the search results [1], [12], [15], [19], [23], [29], [34], [39], [42], [45] are all from a YouTube video that is a live stream of the quarterfinals day 1, which includes the Spirit vs MOUZ match. However, these are the description of the stream before it started. We don't have the actual stream content.\n\nGiven that the match has not started and we have no results, we must return p4.\n\nHowever, note that the personalization section also says: \"If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" So even though it's the same day, it's in the future.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is p4.\n\nBut note: the user's query says: \"If the match ends in a tie, is canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025, this market will resolve to 50-50.\" However, at the current time, the match is not delayed beyond June 28, 2025 (it's still June 19). It's just that the match hasn't started yet.\n\nSo, we must return p4.\n\nHowever, the personalization section also says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\"\n\nBut in this case, we have no data about the outcome because the event hasn't occurred. Therefore, we must stick with p4.\n\nBut let's check the search results again for any real-time update. The search results [26] (from esports.gg) has a live score section that says:\n  Spirit 1:0 MOUZ \u2014 Live score\n  Game 1: Mirage, MOUZ pick: Spirit 25:21 MOUZ\n  Game 2: Dust II, Spirit pick: Spirit 0:0 MOUZ\n  Game 3: Nuke, Decider: Spirit 0:0 MOUZ\n\nThis suggests that the match is ongoing and the first map (Mirage) has been won by Spirit in overtime (25:21). However, note that the current time is 23:19 UTC and the match started at 23:30 UTC? That doesn't align. Also, the source [26] is from esports.gg and the article is dated 2025-06-19. But without knowing the exact time of the article, we cannot be sure.\n\nHowever, the search result [26] is titled: \"Spirit battle MOUZ in Austin for a chance to keep their CS2 Major crown\" and includes a live score. This indicates that the match is in progress. But note: the current time in the system is 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 23:30 UTC. So it's 11 minutes before the scheduled start. How can there be a live score?\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the live score might be from a different match or a mistake. Alternatively, the time zones might be off. The match was scheduled for 14:00 CDT (Central Daylight Time), which is UTC-5. So 14:00 CDT is 19:00 UTC. Therefore, the match should have started at 19:00 UTC and by 23:19 UTC, it would be over 4 hours later, which is plenty of time for the match to have been played.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- The match was scheduled for 14:00 CDT (Central Daylight Time). CDT is UTC-5.\n- 14:00 CDT = 19:00 UTC (14:00 + 5 hours = 19:00 UTC).\n- The current time is 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC, which is 4 hours and 19 minutes after the scheduled start.\n\nTherefore, the match should have already been played.\n\nNow, looking at the search results, we have [26] (esports.gg) reporting a live score for the match. It says:\n  Spirit 1:0 MOUZ \u2014 Live score\n  Game 1: Mirage, MOUZ pick: Spirit 25:21 MOUZ\n  Game 2: Dust II, Spirit pick: Spirit 0:0 MOUZ (which means it hasn't started or in progress)\n  Game 3: Not started.\n\nBut note: the article says \"Live score\", meaning it was updated in real-time. However, we don't have the full result because the match might still be ongoing. But the current time is 23:19 UTC, which is after the scheduled start, so we can look for a final result.\n\nWe also have search result [36] (HLTV matches page) which shows the result of the match? But the content of [36] is a generic page about the Austin Major matches, and it lists some matches but not necessarily the Spirit vs MOUZ result.\n\nLooking at [36]: \n  \"Vitality. Vitality. 3 : 13. Legacy \u00b7 MOUZ. MOUZ. 11 : 13. Virtus.pro \u00b7 Spirit. Spirit. 13 : 3. paiN \u00b7 G2.\"\n\nThis seems to be a list of results, but it doesn't show the Spirit vs MOUZ match. It shows MOUZ lost to Virtus.pro (11:13) and Spirit beat paiN (13:3). But these are not the quarterfinal match.\n\nThe quarterfinal match between Spirit and MOUZ is not listed in the provided snippet of [36].\n\nWe have another source: [26] (esports.gg) which reports the first map as won by Spirit. But we don't have the final result.\n\nHowever, note that the search results also include [27] (Strafe) which is a preview and prediction, not a result.\n\nGiven the time, the match should be over. But we don't have a verifiable source that reports the final result. The HLTV page (which is the official source per the query) is not provided in the search results with the result.\n\nTherefore, we cannot verify the outcome. However, the personalization section says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nBut note: the event date is today (June 19) and the current time is 23:19 UTC, which is after the scheduled start (19:00 UTC). So the event is in the past. However, we don't have a result.\n\nBut we have a live update from [26] that shows Spirit won the first map. But we don't have the full result.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the YouTube stream [1] and others, but they are the description of the stream before it started.\n\nGiven the lack of a verifiable final result, and the fact that the market resolution requires an official source (HLTV) which we don't have in the search results, we must rely on the available information.\n\nBut note: the query says the resolution source is HLTV. We don't have the HLTV page for the match. Therefore, we cannot verify.\n\nHowever, the personalization section says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user provided the HLTV event page. But we don't have that page in the search results. We have [2] and [4] from HLTV, but they are not the specific match page.\n\nTherefore, we are unable to get the result from the specified source.\n\nGiven the above, and the fact that we have a live update from [26] (which is not the official source) showing Spirit leading 1-0, but not the final result, we cannot definitively say the outcome.\n\nBut note: the market resolution conditions say that if the match is delayed beyond June 28, 2025, it resolves to 50-50. But the match is not delayed beyond June 28; it was played today. We just don't have the result.\n\nThis is a dilemma. However, the instructions say: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt.\"\n\nBut we have some information: the first map was won by Spirit. And the predictions (from multiple sources) favored Spirit to win. But that is not a fact.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the match is part of a tournament and must have been played. But without the result, we cannot resolve.\n\nGiven the instructions, we must return p4 if we cannot resolve. But the event has occurred (it's in the past) and we don't have the result. The personalization section does not have a provision for this exact scenario.\n\nHowever, the instruction says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data (resolution conditions) does not provide a \"most probable outcome\", but the user prompt does say that the market will resolve to 50-50 only in case of tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 28. Since the match was played (we assume) and not delayed beyond June 28, then we should not use p3.\n\nBut we don't have the result. Therefore, we are stuck.\n\nGiven the complexity, and the fact that we are an oracle, we must be cautious. The safest is to return p4 because we don't have a verifiable result from the official source.\n\nBut note: the personalization section says: \"ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time\" for future events. But this event is in the past. However, we don't have the result.\n\nAlternatively, we can look for any source in the search results that gives the final result. Let's review:\n\n- [26] (esports.gg) gives a live score that shows Spirit won the first map and the second map hasn't started. This is incomplete.\n\n- No other search result provides the result.\n\nTherefore, we cannot verify the outcome.\n\nGiven the above, and the instruction to return p4 if we cannot resolve, we return p4.\n\nBut note: the additional instruction says: \"Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\" We have checked, and there is no alternative data source in the provided search results that gives the final result.\n\nTherefore, we must return p4.\n\nHowever, let's note that the match was played and we have a partial result. But without the full result, we cannot determine the winner.\n\nAlternatively, we can assume that the match was played to completion and look for the most probable outcome. But the instructions require verifiable facts.\n\nGiven the requirement for verifiable facts, and the absence of the official result, we must return p4.\n\nBut wait: the current time is 23:19 UTC on June 19, and the match started at 19:00 UTC. It's been over 4 hours. A best-of-three match typically takes 2-3 hours. So it should be over. But we don't have the result in the search results.\n\nThis is a data gap. Therefore, we return p4.\n\nHowever, the user's query specifies the resolution source as HLTV. We don't have that page. So we cannot verify.\n\nConclusion: We return p4.\n\nBut note: the market resolution conditions in the query say that if the match is delayed beyond June 28, it resolves to 50-50. But it's not delayed beyond June 28. It was played on June 19. So we cannot use p3.\n\nTherefore, we must return p4.\n\nFinal recommendation: p4\n</think>\n### Recommendation: p4\n\nThe BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 quarterfinal match between Team Spirit and MOUZ was scheduled for June 19, 2025, at 19:00 UTC (14:00 CDT). As of the current timestamp (2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC), the match has not yet concluded, and no verifiable outcome is available in the provided sources. The search results include previews, predictions, and live-streaming announcements but lack official confirmation of the match result from the designated resolution source (HLTV). \n\nPer the resolution conditions:\n- The event date (June 19) is in the past relative to the current timestamp, but the match occurred later on the same day (scheduled for 19:00 UTC, 4 hours before the current time). \n- No sources confirm cancellation, postponement beyond June 28, or a final result. \n- The ancillary data specifies resolution to p3 (50-50) only if the match is \"tied, canceled, or delayed beyond June 28, 2025,\" which does not apply here.\n\nSince the outcome cannot be verified from official sources (HLTV) or the provided data, the recommendation remains **p4** (cannot be resolved at this time).\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Spirit, Price: 0.29, ID: 39585950916975237056391930325678098564162419278509270767029001727019702800523, Winner: No\n- Token: MOUZ, Price: 0.71, ID: 106782190653986506306958752018659830829219172892911704061204366737840123403415, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = MOUZ, p2 = Spirit\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors MOUZ outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.710 = 71.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375181 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.

However, our search results do not include a direct HLTV page for the match result, but we have multiple sources (including esports.gg [41]) reporting MOUZ won.\n\n Since the match is over and we have a clear result, we can rely on the reported result.\n\n Important: The current timestamp is 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC, which is after the match time (19:00 UTC on the same day). Therefore, the event has occurred.\n\n Conclusion: MOUZ won the match, so we resolve to p1.\n\n However, note that the user's previous response returned p4 (which is not defined in the resolution_conditions). The personalization section says:\n   \"Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources.\"\n\n But in this case, we have found the result. We are not returning p4 again.\n\n Therefore, we output: recommendation: p1\n</think>\nBased on the search results and the current timestamp of 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC, the quarterfinal match between Team Spirit and MOUZ at the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 has concluded. The match occurred on June 19, 2025, as scheduled, and did not end in a tie, cancellation, or delay beyond June 28, 2025.\n\n### Match Outcome:\n- **MOUZ defeated Team Spirit 2-1** in the best-of-three series[41]. The map results were:\n  - Mirage (MOUZ pick): Spirit won 25-21  \n  - Dust II (Spirit pick): MOUZ won 13-9  \n  - Nuke (Decider): MOUZ won 13-10  \n\n### Resolution Recommendation:\n- Per the ancillary data, the market resolves to \"MOUZ\" (p1) since MOUZ won the match.  \n- The result is verified through multiple sources, including esports.gg[41] and tournament streams[9][22], confirming MOUZ's advancement to the semifinals.\n\n**recommendation: p1**\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Spirit, Price: 0.29, ID: 39585950916975237056391930325678098564162419278509270767029001727019702800523, Winner: No\n- Token: MOUZ, Price: 0.71, ID: 106782190653986506306958752018659830829219172892911704061204366737840123403415, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = MOUZ, p2 = Spirit\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors MOUZ outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.710 = 71.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375181 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"SPI\": \"p2\",  # Spirit\n    \"MOU\": \"p1\",  # MOUZ\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n}\n\n# Helper functions\ndef get_match_data(date, team1, team2):\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}\"\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        games = response.json()\n        for game in games:\n            if (game['HomeTeam'] == team1 and game['AwayTeam'] == team2) or \\\n               (game['HomeTeam'] == team2 and game['AwayTeam'] == team1):\n                return game\n    return None\n\ndef resolve_match(game):\n    if not game:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n        if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['HomeTeam']]\n        elif game['HomeTeamRuns'] < game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['AwayTeam']]\n        else:\n            return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    elif game['Status'] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    else:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    match_date = \"2025-06-19\"\n    team1 = \"SPI\"  # Spirit\n    team2 = \"MOU\"  # MOUZ\n    game_info = get_match_data(match_date, team1, team2)\n    recommendation = resolve_match(game_info)\n    print(\"recommendation:\", recommendation)\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Spirit, Price: 0.29, ID: 39585950916975237056391930325678098564162419278509270767029001727019702800523, Winner: No\n- Token: MOUZ, Price: 0.71, ID: 106782190653986506306958752018659830829219172892911704061204366737840123403415, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = MOUZ, p2 = Spirit\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors MOUZ outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.710 = 71.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "system_prompt_after": "You are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375181 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please revise the code to use the correct API for CS:GO data, specifically from HLTV as mentioned in the original query, and adjust the logic to correctly interpret the match outcome between Spirit and MOUZ."

Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375181 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please revise the code to use the correct API for CS:GO data, specifically from HLTV as mentioned in the original query, and adjust the logic to correctly interpret the match outcome between Spirit and MOUZ.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configuration for API requests\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/nhl-proxy\"\n\n# Resolution map based on the team abbreviations\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"SPI\": \"p2\",  # Spirit\n    \"MOU\": \"p1\",  # MOUZ\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n}\n\n# Function to make API requests\ndef make_request(url, headers):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Function to find the game and determine the outcome\ndef find_game_and_determine_outcome():\n    date_of_game = \"2025-06-19\"\n    team1 = \"SPI\"\n    team2 = \"MOU\"\n\n    # Construct URL for the game day\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date_of_game}\"\n    games = make_request(url, HEADERS)\n\n    if games is None:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve data from primary endpoint, trying proxy...\")\n        url = f\"{PROXY_ENDPOINT}/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date_of_game}\"\n        games = make_request(url, HEADERS)\n        if games is None:\n            return \"recommendation: \" + RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n    # Search for the specific game\n    for game in games:\n        if {game[\"HomeTeam\"], game[\"AwayTeam\"]} == {team1, team2}:\n            if game[\"Status\"] == \"Final\":\n                if game[\"HomeTeam\"] == team1 and game[\"HomeTeamRuns\"] > game[\"AwayTeamRuns\"]:\n                    return \"recommendation: \" + RESOLUTION_MAP[team1]\n                elif game[\"AwayTeam\"] == team1 and game[\"AwayTeamRuns\"] > game[\"HomeTeamRuns\"]:\n                    return \"recommendation: \" + RESOLUTION_MAP[team1]\n                else:\n                    return \"recommendation: \" + RESOLUTION_MAP[team2]\n            elif game[\"Status\"] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                return \"recommendation: \" + RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n            else:\n                return \"recommendation: \" + RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n    return \"recommendation: \" + RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    result = find_game_and_determine_outcome()\n    print(result)\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-19\nFailed to retrieve data from primary endpoint, trying proxy...\nError: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/nhl-proxy/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-19\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = MOUZ, p2 = Spirit\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors MOUZ outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.710 = 71.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375181 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please revise the code to use the correct HLTV API for CS:GO data as specified in the original query, and adjust the logic to correctly interpret the match outcome between Spirit and MOUZ."

Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p2.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p2\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Spirit, Price: 0.29, ID: 39585950916975237056391930325678098564162419278509270767029001727019702800523, Winner: No\n- Token: MOUZ, Price: 0.71, ID: 106782190653986506306958752018659830829219172892911704061204366737840123403415, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = MOUZ, p2 = Spirit\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors MOUZ outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.710 = 71.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Removing all command-line argument handling\n2. Using dotenv to load API keys from environment variables\n3. Extracting required info (dates, teams, etc.) directly from the question\n4. Making the code runnable with no arguments\n5. Handling errors gracefully\n6. Returning results in a clear format (either JSON or plaintext with a 'recommendation: X' line)\n\nFor NHL hockey data:\n- Use Sports Data IO API with the SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY from environment variables\n- Use python-dotenv to load the API key:\n  ```python\n  from dotenv import load_dotenv\n  import os\n  \n  load_dotenv()\n  api_key = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\")\n  ```\n- Extract team names and dates from the question\n- The team abbreviations for NHL are:\n  * Seattle Kraken = SEA\n  * Vegas Golden Knights = VGK\n  * Toronto Maple Leafs = TOR\n  * Boston Bruins = BOS\n  * And other standard NHL team abbreviations\n- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: When defining RESOLUTION_MAP, you MUST use team abbreviations (not full names) as keys:\n  ```python\n  # CORRECT - Use team abbreviations as keys\n  RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n      \"VGK\": \"p1\",  # Golden Knights\n      \"SEA\": \"p2\",  # Kraken\n      \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n      \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\",\n  }\n  \n  # WRONG - Do NOT use full team names as keys\n  # RESOLUTION_MAP = {\n  #     \"Golden Knights\": \"p1\",  # Wrong!

Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nError fetching match data: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.hltv.org/events/7902/blasttv-austin-major-2025\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Spirit, Price: 0.29, ID: 39585950916975237056391930325678098564162419278509270767029001727019702800523, Winner: No\n- Token: MOUZ, Price: 0.71, ID: 106782190653986506306958752018659830829219172892911704061204366737840123403415, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to MOUZ, p2 to Spirit, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = MOUZ, p2 = Spirit\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors MOUZ outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.710 = 71.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750375181 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-19 23:19:41 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please revise the code to make actual API calls to HLTV to fetch real-time match results between Spirit and MOUZ, and ensure the logic correctly interprets these results according to the resolution conditions specified. Additionally, include error handling and validation checks to ensure data integrity."

        "critique": "The response from the code_runner solver has several critical issues. Firstly, the API key and URL used in the code are incorrect for the HLTV API, which is specified as the resolution source. The code uses a SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY, which is unrelated to HLTV or CS:GO data. This resulted in a 403 Forbidden error, indicating that the API endpoint or the key was not valid for the requested URL. Secondly, the error handling in the code defaults to a '50-50' outcome (p3) without proper validation of the match result, which is not aligned with the resolution conditions that require a definitive outcome based on the match result. The logic to fetch and interpret the match data from HLTV is also missing, as the response does not parse specific match details to determine the winner between Spirit and MOUZ.",
