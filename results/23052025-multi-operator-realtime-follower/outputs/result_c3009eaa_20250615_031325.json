      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the \"Grounded in the Stars\" statue by Thomas J. Price will be removed from Times Square early, specifically by June 15, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for No, p2 for Yes, and p3 for uncertain. \n\nFirst, I need to check the installation dates. The search results mention the statue was installed on April 29, 2025, and was scheduled to be removed in mid-June. Source [1] says it will be removed in mid-June, and [3] specifies the end date as June 14. Source [6] and [7] mention June 17 as the removal date. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. [3] and [9] say June 14, while [6] and [7] say June 17. The user's current date is June 15, 2025. \n\nThe user is asking if it's removed early, meaning before the scheduled date. If the original end date was June 14, then by June 15, it's already gone, so the answer would be No (p1). But if the scheduled date was June 17, then removal by June 15 would be early, so Yes (p2). \n\nLooking at the sources again: [3] from Times Square Arts states the end date as June 14. [6] (Timeout) says June 17. [7] (Wikipedia) also says June 17. However, the official Times Square website in [9] and [12] lists the end date as June 14. The artist's own site [10] also mentions June 14. So the official sources seem to point to June 14 as the scheduled removal. \n\nTherefore, if the statue was supposed to be removed on June 14, then by June 15, it's already removed as per the plan. The user's query is whether it's removed early (before the scheduled date). Since the scheduled date is June 14, removal by June 15 isn't early\u2014it's on time. Hence, the answer should be No (p1). \n\nBut wait, the user's current timestamp is June 15, 2025, 3:09 AM UTC. If the removal was scheduled for June 14, then on June 15, it's already gone. The market resolves based on whether it was removed by June 15. If the scheduled removal was June 14, then it's already removed by June 15, so the answer is No (p1) because it wasn't removed early; it was removed on schedule. However, the user's question is whether it's removed early, which would mean before the planned date. If the planned date was June 14, and it was removed on June 14, that's not early. So the answer is No. \n\nBut some sources mention June 17. If there's conflicting info, I need to check which sources are more reliable. The official Times Square Arts pages ([3], [9], [12]) state June 14. Timeout and Wikipedia might have incorrect dates. Therefore, the official end date is June 14. Thus, the statue was removed on schedule, not early. The answer is No (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749956978 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-15 03:09:38 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query.

The artist's own site [10] also mentions June 14. So the official sources seem to point to June 14 as the scheduled removal. \n\nTherefore, if the statue was supposed to be removed on June 14, then by June 15, it's already removed as per the plan. The user's query is whether it's removed early (before the scheduled date). Since the scheduled date is June 14, removal by June 15 isn't early\u2014it's on time. Hence, the answer should be No (p1). \n\nBut wait, the user's current timestamp is June 15, 2025, 3:09 AM UTC. If the removal was scheduled for June 14, then on June 15, it's already gone. The market resolves based on whether it was removed by June 15. If the scheduled removal was June 14, then it's already removed by June 15, so the answer is No (p1) because it wasn't removed early; it was removed on schedule. However, the user's question is whether it's removed early, which would mean before the planned date. If the planned date was June 14, and it was removed on June 14, that's not early. So the answer is No. \n\nBut some sources mention June 17. If there's conflicting info, I need to check which sources are more reliable. The official Times Square Arts pages ([3], [9], [12]) state June 14. Timeout and Wikipedia might have incorrect dates. Therefore, the official end date is June 14. Thus, the statue was removed on schedule, not early. The answer is No (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 53203163716141454493990183784663333432154604019994201636795599422524727068187, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 82649350187298258248888284827622645343688582335643907891261983432331947761789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the \"Grounded in the Stars\" statue by Thomas J. Price will be removed from Times Square early, specifically by June 15, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on credible reporting confirming the removal by that time.\n\nFirst, I need to check the sources provided. Let's go through each one:\n\n1. Source [1] from Fox News mentions the statue was installed on April 29 and will be removed in mid-June. The exact end date isn't specified here, but mid-June could be around the 15th. However, the Times Square website in source [3] and [4] states the installation ends on June 14. Source [5] (Wikipedia) says it's scheduled until June 17, but that might be a discrepancy. \n\n2. Source [2] from Governing.com clearly states the statue was always meant to be temporary and will be removed on Saturday, June 14. Since June 14, 2025, is a Saturday, that aligns with the removal date mentioned here.\n\n3. The official Times Square Arts pages in sources [3], [4], and [11] all confirm the end date as June 14. The artist's own website (source [11]) also lists June 14 as the removal date.\n\n4. The Wikipedia entry in source [5] mentions June 17, but this might be an error or an extension not reflected in official sources. Given that the official sources and news articles (Fox News and Governing.com) all point to June 14, it's more reliable to go with the earlier date.\n\n5. The current date is June 15, 2025, according to the system prompt. If the statue was scheduled to be removed on June 14, then by June 15, it should already be gone. However, the user's query is whether it will be removed *early*. The original plan was June 14, so removal on that date isn't early\u2014it's on time. But if the official end date was June 17 (per Wikipedia), then June 14 would be early. However, since multiple credible sources contradict the Wikipedia date, the June 14 removal is the planned date, not early.\n\nWait, the user's ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if removed by June 15. If the planned removal was June 14, then it's removed on time, not early. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\" because it wasn't removed early; it was removed as scheduled. But the user's query is phrased as \"Will the statue be removed early?\" If the official end date was June 14, then removal on June 14 is not early. However, if some sources say June 17, but the majority say June 14, there's a conflict. \n\nLooking at the sources again: the official Times Square Arts (sources [3], [4], [11]) say June 14. The Wikipedia entry (source [5]) says June 17, but that's less reliable. The news articles (sources [1], [2]) also mention mid-June or June 14. Therefore, the credible reporting consensus points to June 14 as the planned removal date. Therefore, removal by June 15 would have already happened as planned, not early. Hence, the answer is \"No\" (p1). \n\nBut wait, the user's query is whether it's removed *early*. If the original plan was June 14, then removal on June 14 is on time, not early. So the market should resolve to \"No\" because it wasn't removed before the scheduled date. However, if the user's ancillary data defines the resolution based on removal by June 15 regardless of the original schedule, then if it's removed by June 15, it's \"Yes\". But according to the official sources, the removal was scheduled for June 14, so it's removed on time, not early. Therefore, the answer is \"No\". \n\nBut the market's description says: \"This market will resolve to 'Yes' if the sculpture... is physically removed... by 11:59 PM ET on June 15, 2025.\" So regardless of the original schedule, if it's removed by that date, it's \"Yes\". However, the original schedule was to remove it on June 14, so it's removed on time, not early. But the market's question is whether it's removed by June 15, not whether it's early. Wait, the title of the market is \"Will the Black Woman statue be removed from Times Square early?\" but the description says it resolves to \"Yes\" if removed by June 15. The original end date was June 14, so removal by June 15 would be on time, not early. But perhaps the user considers any removal before June 17 (per Wikipedia) as early. However, the consensus from credible sources is June 14, so the removal on June 14 is on time. Therefore, the answer is \"No\" because it wasn't removed before the scheduled date. But the market's resolution is based on the date, not the original schedule. The description says it resolves to \"Yes\" if removed by June 15. Since it was removed on June 14, which is before June 15, the answer is \"Yes\". Wait, but the original scheduled removal was June 14, so removal on that date is not early. The confusion comes from whether \"early\" refers to before the scheduled date or just by June 15. The market's description might be ambiguously worded. However, the resolution conditions are based purely on the date, not the original schedule. Therefore, if it's removed by June 15, it's \"Yes\", regardless of whether that's the planned date. But according to the sources, the planned date was June 14, so it was removed on time, not early. However, the market's title uses \"early\", but the description's resolution is based on the date. This is a conflict. The resolution should follow the description, which is based on the date, not the term \"early\". Therefore, if the statue was removed by June 15, it's \"Yes\". Since it was removed on June 14, the answer is \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nBut the user's ancillary data says the resolution source is a consensus of credible reporting. The credible reporting (sources [2], [3], [4], [11]) all state the removal was on June 14, which is before June 15. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\" because it was removed by the specified date. The term \"early\" in the title might be misleading, but the description's resolution is based on the date, not the original schedule. Therefore, the correct resolution is \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The artist's own website (source [11]) also lists June 14 as the removal date.\n\n4. The Wikipedia entry in source [5] mentions June 17, but this might be an error or an extension not reflected in official sources. Given that the official sources and news articles (Fox News and Governing.com) all point to June 14, it's more reliable to go with the earlier date.\n\n5. The current date is June 15, 2025, according to the system prompt. If the statue was scheduled to be removed on June 14, then by June 15, it should already be gone. However, the user's query is whether it will be removed *early*. The original plan was June 14, so removal on that date isn't early\u2014it's on time. But if the official end date was June 17 (per Wikipedia), then June 14 would be early. However, since multiple credible sources contradict the Wikipedia date, the June 14 removal is the planned date, not early.\n\nWait, the user's ancillary data says the market resolves to \"Yes\" if removed by June 15. If the planned removal was June 14, then it's removed on time, not early. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\" because it wasn't removed early; it was removed as scheduled. But the user's query is phrased as \"Will the statue be removed early?\" If the official end date was June 14, then removal on June 14 is not early. However, if some sources say June 17, but the majority say June 14, there's a conflict. \n\nLooking at the sources again: the official Times Square Arts (sources [3], [4], [11]) say June 14. The Wikipedia entry (source [5]) says June 17, but that's less reliable. The news articles (sources [1], [2]) also mention mid-June or June 14. Therefore, the credible reporting consensus points to June 14 as the planned removal date. Therefore, removal by June 15 would have already happened as planned, not early. Hence, the answer is \"No\" (p1). \n\nBut wait, the user's query is whether it's removed *early*. If the original plan was June 14, then removal on June 14 is on time, not early. So the market should resolve to \"No\" because it wasn't removed before the scheduled date. However, if the user's ancillary data defines the resolution based on removal by June 15 regardless of the original schedule, then if it's removed by June 15, it's \"Yes\". But according to the official sources, the removal was scheduled for June 14, so it's removed on time, not early. Therefore, the answer is \"No\". \n\nBut the market's description says: \"This market will resolve to 'Yes' if the sculpture... is physically removed... by 11:59 PM ET on June 15, 2025.\" So regardless of the original schedule, if it's removed by that date, it's \"Yes\". However, the original schedule was to remove it on June 14, so it's removed on time, not early. But the market's question is whether it's removed by June 15, not whether it's early. Wait, the title of the market is \"Will the Black Woman statue be removed from Times Square early?\" but the description says it resolves to \"Yes\" if removed by June 15. The original end date was June 14, so removal by June 15 would be on time, not early. But perhaps the user considers any removal before June 17 (per Wikipedia) as early. However, the consensus from credible sources is June 14, so the removal on June 14 is on time. Therefore, the answer is \"No\" because it wasn't removed before the scheduled date. But the market's resolution is based on the date, not the original schedule. The description says it resolves to \"Yes\" if removed by June 15. Since it was removed on June 14, which is before June 15, the answer is \"Yes\". Wait, but the original scheduled removal was June 14, so removal on that date is not early. The confusion comes from whether \"early\" refers to before the scheduled date or just by June 15. The market's description might be ambiguously worded. However, the resolution conditions are based purely on the date, not the original schedule. Therefore, if it's removed by June 15, it's \"Yes\", regardless of whether that's the planned date. But according to the sources, the planned date was June 14, so it was removed on time, not early. However, the market's title uses \"early\", but the description's resolution is based on the date. This is a conflict. The resolution should follow the description, which is based on the date, not the term \"early\". Therefore, if the statue was removed by June 15, it's \"Yes\". Since it was removed on June 14, the answer is \"Yes\" (p2). \n\nBut the user's ancillary data says the resolution source is a consensus of credible reporting. The credible reporting (sources [2], [3], [4], [11]) all state the removal was on June 14, which is before June 15. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\" because it was removed by the specified date. The term \"early\" in the title might be misleading, but the description's resolution is based on the date, not the original schedule. Therefore, the correct resolution is \"Yes\" (p2).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.994, ID: 53203163716141454493990183784663333432154604019994201636795599422524727068187, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.006, ID: 82649350187298258248888284827622645343688582335643907891261983432331947761789, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.994 = 99.4% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
