Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Rangers vs. White Sox, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for May 25 at 2:10PM ET:\nIf the Texas Rangers win, the market will resolve to \"Rangers\".\nIf the Chicago White Sox win, the market will resolve to \"White Sox\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = White Sox, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.795 = 79.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Rangers vs. White Sox, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for May 25 at 2:10PM ET:\nIf the Texas Rangers win, the market will resolve to \"Rangers\".\nIf the Chicago White Sox win, the market will resolve to \"White Sox\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = White Sox, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.795 = 79.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Rangers vs. White Sox, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for May 25 at 2:10PM ET:\nIf the Texas Rangers win, the market will resolve to \"Rangers\".\nIf the Chicago White Sox win, the market will resolve to \"White Sox\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = White Sox, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.795 = 79.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Rangers vs. White Sox, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for May 25 at 2:10PM ET:\nIf the Texas Rangers win, the market will resolve to \"Rangers\".\nIf the Chicago White Sox win, the market will resolve to \"White Sox\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748206420 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 20:53:40 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Ensure API keys are valid and endpoints are correctly configured to retrieve data.

Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = White Sox, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.795 = 79.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Texas Rangers vs. Chicago White Sox game scheduled for May 25, 2025, at 2:10 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if the White Sox win, it's p1; if the Rangers win, p2; if postponed, it stays open until played; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on the specified date. The current timestamp given is May 25, 2025, 8:53:40 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 2:10 PM ET, which is 18:10 UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, I need to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game on May 25. For example, result [2] is a box score from May 25, 2025, showing the game between the Rangers and White Sox. However, the detailed box score isn't fully visible here. Result [4] also lists the game on May 25 with starting pitchers Patrick Corbin for the Rangers and Davis Martin for the White Sox. \n\nResult [25] provides a preview of the game, mentioning the starting pitchers and some player stats. However, the key information comes from results like [18] and [28], which detail the May 24 game where the White Sox won 10-5. But the user is asking about the May 25 game. \n\nWait, there's a possible confusion here. The user's query is about the game on May 25, but many search results refer to the May 24 game. Let me check the dates carefully. Results [1], [3], [6], [7], [10], [11], [14], [16], [17], [18], [19], [23], [27], [28], [35], [38], [52], [55], [56], [58], [62], [66], [67], [69], [72] all discuss the May 24 game where the White Sox won. \n\nHowever, the May 25 game is covered in results [2], [4], [8], [9], [24], [25], [29], [30], [33], [40], [42], [44], [46], [47], [54], [60], [65], [68], [70], [71]. For example, result [25] is a preview article from ABC7 Chicago dated May 25, discussing the upcoming game. Result [33] on ESPN shows the live score for May 25, but the data is unavailable. Result [46] is a box score for May 25, but the details are cut off. \n\nWait, result [2] is a box score for May 25, but the content shows the Rangers and White Sox with H and E columns, but the actual runs aren't visible. Similarly, result [24] is a box score for May 25, but the runs aren't listed. Result [30] is another box score for May 25, but again, the runs aren't visible. \n\nLooking deeper, result [65] is a prediction article for the May 25 game, but it doesn't provide the actual result. Result [44] is a prediction article from May 25, but again, no result. The key is to find a source that confirms the outcome of the May 25 game. \n\nWait, result [25] from ABC7 Chicago is a preview, not the result. Result [33] on ESPN's live score page for May 25 shows the game as \"Victory+\" but no score. Result [46] is a box score for May 25, but the runs aren't visible in the snippet. However, result [60] is a box score for May 25, and the snippet shows Jake Burger hitting a two-run homer in the top of the 2nd inning, putting the Rangers up 2-0. But that's just one play. \n\nWait, result [61] is a video of Jake Burger's two-run homer on May 25, indicating the Rangers scored. But without the full game result, it's hard to determine. However, result [72] is a YouTube video titled \"Rangers vs. White Sox Game Highlights (5/24/25)\" which mentions the White Sox winning 10-5, but that's the previous day's game. \n\nSince the user's query is about the May 25 game, and the current timestamp is May 25, 8:53 PM UTC (which is after the game's scheduled time), I need to check if there's any report of the game's outcome. The search results don't clearly show the result of the May 25 game. However, result [25] mentions the Rangers entering the game on a six-game losing streak, and result [70] is a prediction article from May 24, but no result. \n\nGiven that the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of the May 25 game's outcome, and the current timestamp is after the game, but the provided context doesn't include the final result, I might have to assume that the game proceeded as scheduled. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky. \n\nWait, looking at result [25], it's a preview article from May 25, 2025, stating the Rangers are 25-28 and the White Sox 17-35. The game is set for 2:10 PM EDT. The current timestamp is May 25, 8:53 PM UTC, which is 4:53 PM EDT. Wait, no\u2014UTC is 4 hours ahead of EDT. So May 25, 8:53 PM UTC is 4:53 PM EDT. The game was scheduled for 2:10 PM EDT, so it should have concluded by 4:53 PM EDT. Therefore, the game should have ended, and the result should be available. \n\nBut in the provided search results, there's no clear mention of the May 25 game's outcome. The latest results are from May 24 and previews for May 25. Since the user's personalization instructions say to resolve based on verified facts and if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data defines p1 as White Sox win, p2 as Rangers. If the game was played and no info is found, perhaps default to p4 (cannot resolve), but the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nHowever, the search results do mention the May 25 game's starting pitchers: Patrick Corbin for the Rangers and Davis Martin for the White Sox. The Rangers were slight favorites. But without the actual result, it's unclear. \n\nWait, result [61] shows Jake Burger hitting a two-run homer in the top of the 2nd inning on May 25, putting the Rangers up 2-0. But that's just one play. The full game isn't detailed. \n\nGiven the lack of conclusive evidence in the provided search results about the May 25 game's outcome, and considering the user's instruction to resolve based on available info, if no verifiable outcome is found, the resolution would depend on whether the game was played. Since the timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation, it's likely the game was played. \n\nBut without the result, the instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Rangers were favorites, but the White Sox had won the previous two games. However, without data, it's speculative. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe conditions in the user prompt (ancillary data) don't specify probabilities, just the resolution options. Since the game date is in the past and no sources confirm the outcome, but the Rangers were favorites, perhaps the default is p2 (Rangers). However, the White Sox had momentum from previous wins. \n\nBut without explicit sources, the safe answer is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the problem is that the search results don't include the May 25 game's result, only the May 24 game. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there's no information about the May 25 game's outcome. Hence, according to the resolution conditions, if the game was canceled, it's p3 (50-50), but there's no info on cancellation. Since the game was scheduled and the timestamp is past, but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven that the Rangers were favorites and the White Sox are a weaker team, but the White Sox had won the previous two games, it's a tough call. However, without explicit data, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the Rangers won. But without evidence, it's risky. \n\nWait, looking at result [25], it's a preview article from May 25, 2025, stating the Rangers are 25-28 and the White Sox 17-35. The game is part of a series where the White Sox had already won the first two games. The starting pitchers are Patrick Corbin (3-3, 3.59 ERA) for the Rangers and Davis Martin (2-5, 3.49 ERA) for the White Sox. \n\nIn the absence of the actual result, but considering the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Rangers were slight favorites, but the White Sox were at home and had momentum. However, without explicit data, it's impossible to confirm. \n\nGiven the strict instructions, if there's no verifiable information, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the event date is in the past and no sources provide the outcome, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. The conditions in the user prompt don't specify probabilities, but the ancillary data defines p1 as White Sox win, p2 as Rangers. \n\nGiven that the White Sox were on a two-game winning streak and the Rangers were on a six-game losing streak, perhaps the most probable outcome is the White Sox winning (p1). However, the Rangers were favorites in the betting odds (result [25] mentions Rangers -145, White Sox +122). \n\nIn betting terms, the Rangers were favored, so the probable outcome would be Rangers (p2). However, the White Sox had momentum. \n\nThis is conflicting. Without explicit data, but following the ancillary data's resolution conditions, and given that the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, and the Rangers were favorites, the resolution would be p2 (Rangers). However, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, if the game wasn't played due to some reason not mentioned in the search results, it would be p3. But there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the instructions, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve due to lack of information). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nSince the Rangers were favorites, but the White Sox had won the previous games, and without concrete data, it's a tough call. However, the instructions might require a resolution. \n\nWait, looking back at the search results, result [25] is a preview article from May 25, 2025, which states the Rangers are 25-28 and the White Sox 17-35. The game is scheduled for 2:10 PM EDT. The current timestamp is May 25, 8:53 PM UTC (4:53 PM EDT), so the game should have concluded. \n\nBut in the provided search results, there's no mention of the game's result. The latest results are from May 24. Therefore, it's possible that the game data isn't included in the provided context. \n\nIn this case, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p1 as White Sox win, p2 as Rangers. \n\nGiven that the Rangers were favorites (result [25] mentions Rangers -145), the probable outcome is Rangers (p2). Therefore, the recommendation would be p2. \n\nHowever, this is an assumption. Without explicit confirmation, but following the user's instructions, this is the best approach.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748206420 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 20:53:40 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Texas Rangers vs. Chicago White Sox game scheduled for May 25, 2025, at 2:10 PM ET. The resolution conditions are straightforward: if the White Sox win, it's p1; if the Rangers win, p2; if postponed, it stays open until played; if canceled, it's 50-50 (p3).\n\nFirst, I need to check if the game happened on the specified date. The current timestamp given is May 25, 2025, 8:53:40 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 2:10 PM ET, which is 18:10 UTC. Since the current time is after the game's scheduled time, I need to determine the outcome.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention the game on May 25. For example, result [2] is a box score from May 25, 2025, showing the game between the Rangers and White Sox. However, the detailed box score isn't fully visible here. Result [4] also lists the game on May 25 with starting pitchers Patrick Corbin for the Rangers and Davis Martin for the White Sox. \n\nResult [25] provides a preview of the game, mentioning the starting pitchers and some player stats. However, the key information comes from results like [18] and [28], which detail the May 24 game where the White Sox won 10-5. But the user is asking about the May 25 game. \n\nWait, there's a possible confusion here. The user's query is about the game on May 25, but many search results refer to the May 24 game. Let me check the dates carefully. Results [1], [3], [6], [7], [10], [11], [14], [16], [17], [18], [19], [23], [27], [28], [35], [38], [52], [55], [56], [58], [62], [66], [67], [69], [72] all discuss the May 24 game where the White Sox won. \n\nHowever, the May 25 game is covered in results [2], [4], [8], [9], [24], [25], [29], [30], [33], [40], [42], [44], [46], [47], [54], [60], [65], [68], [70], [71]. For example, result [25] is a preview article from ABC7 Chicago dated May 25, discussing the upcoming game. Result [33] on ESPN shows the live score for May 25, but the data is unavailable. Result [46] is a box score for May 25, but the details are cut off. \n\nWait, result [2] is a box score for May 25, but the content shows the Rangers and White Sox with H and E columns, but the actual runs aren't visible. Similarly, result [24] is a box score for May 25, but the runs aren't listed. Result [30] is another box score for May 25, but again, the runs aren't visible. \n\nLooking deeper, result [65] is a prediction article for the May 25 game, but it doesn't provide the actual result. Result [44] is a prediction article from May 25, but again, no result. The key is to find a source that confirms the outcome of the May 25 game. \n\nWait, result [25] from ABC7 Chicago is a preview, not the result. Result [33] on ESPN's live score page for May 25 shows the game as \"Victory+\" but no score. Result [46] is a box score for May 25, but the runs aren't visible in the snippet. However, result [60] is a box score for May 25, and the snippet shows Jake Burger hitting a two-run homer in the top of the 2nd inning, putting the Rangers up 2-0. But that's just one play. \n\nWait, result [61] is a video of Jake Burger's two-run homer on May 25, indicating the Rangers scored. But without the full game result, it's hard to determine. However, result [72] is a YouTube video titled \"Rangers vs. White Sox Game Highlights (5/24/25)\" which mentions the White Sox winning 10-5, but that's the previous day's game. \n\nSince the user's query is about the May 25 game, and the current timestamp is May 25, 8:53 PM UTC (which is after the game's scheduled time), I need to check if there's any report of the game's outcome. The search results don't clearly show the result of the May 25 game. However, result [25] mentions the Rangers entering the game on a six-game losing streak, and result [70] is a prediction article from May 24, but no result. \n\nGiven that the search results don't provide conclusive evidence of the May 25 game's outcome, and the current timestamp is after the game, but the provided context doesn't include the final result, I might have to assume that the game proceeded as scheduled. However, without explicit confirmation, it's risky. \n\nWait, looking at result [25], it's a preview article from May 25, 2025, stating the Rangers are 25-28 and the White Sox 17-35. The game is set for 2:10 PM EDT. The current timestamp is May 25, 8:53 PM UTC, which is 4:53 PM EDT. Wait, no\u2014UTC is 4 hours ahead of EDT. So May 25, 8:53 PM UTC is 4:53 PM EDT. The game was scheduled for 2:10 PM EDT, so it should have concluded by 4:53 PM EDT. Therefore, the game should have ended, and the result should be available. \n\nBut in the provided search results, there's no clear mention of the May 25 game's outcome. The latest results are from May 24 and previews for May 25. Since the user's personalization instructions say to resolve based on verified facts and if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data defines p1 as White Sox win, p2 as Rangers. If the game was played and no info is found, perhaps default to p4 (cannot resolve), but the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nHowever, the search results do mention the May 25 game's starting pitchers: Patrick Corbin for the Rangers and Davis Martin for the White Sox. The Rangers were slight favorites. But without the actual result, it's unclear. \n\nWait, result [61] shows Jake Burger hitting a two-run homer in the top of the 2nd inning on May 25, putting the Rangers up 2-0. But that's just one play. The full game isn't detailed. \n\nGiven the lack of conclusive evidence in the provided search results about the May 25 game's outcome, and considering the user's instruction to resolve based on available info, if no verifiable outcome is found, the resolution would depend on whether the game was played. Since the timestamp is after the game's scheduled time, and there's no mention of postponement or cancellation, it's likely the game was played. \n\nBut without the result, the instruction says to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The Rangers were favorites, but the White Sox had won the previous two games. However, without data, it's speculative. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nThe conditions in the user prompt (ancillary data) don't specify probabilities, just the resolution options. Since the game date is in the past and no sources confirm the outcome, but the Rangers were favorites, perhaps the default is p2 (Rangers). However, the White Sox had momentum from previous wins. \n\nBut without explicit sources, the safe answer is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But the problem is that the search results don't include the May 25 game's result, only the May 24 game. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there's no information about the May 25 game's outcome. Hence, according to the resolution conditions, if the game was canceled, it's p3 (50-50), but there's no info on cancellation. Since the game was scheduled and the timestamp is past, but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the user's instruction says if no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven that the Rangers were favorites and the White Sox are a weaker team, but the White Sox had won the previous two games, it's a tough call. However, without explicit data, the resolution should be p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the Rangers won. But without evidence, it's risky. \n\nWait, looking at result [25], it's a preview article from May 25, 2025, stating the Rangers are 25-28 and the White Sox 17-35. The game is part of a series where the White Sox had already won the first two games. The starting pitchers are Patrick Corbin (3-3, 3.59 ERA) for the Rangers and Davis Martin (2-5, 3.49 ERA) for the White Sox. \n\nIn the absence of the actual result, but considering the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. The Rangers were slight favorites, but the White Sox were at home and had momentum. However, without explicit data, it's impossible to confirm. \n\nGiven the strict instructions, if there's no verifiable information, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\"\n\nSince the event date is in the past and no sources provide the outcome, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. The conditions in the user prompt don't specify probabilities, but the ancillary data defines p1 as White Sox win, p2 as Rangers. \n\nGiven that the White Sox were on a two-game winning streak and the Rangers were on a six-game losing streak, perhaps the most probable outcome is the White Sox winning (p1). However, the Rangers were favorites in the betting odds (result [25] mentions Rangers -145, White Sox +122). \n\nIn betting terms, the Rangers were favored, so the probable outcome would be Rangers (p2). However, the White Sox had momentum. \n\nThis is conflicting. Without explicit data, but following the ancillary data's resolution conditions, and given that the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, and the Rangers were favorites, the resolution would be p2 (Rangers). However, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, if the game wasn't played due to some reason not mentioned in the search results, it would be p3. But there's no mention of postponement or cancellation. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and the instructions, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve due to lack of information).

Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = White Sox, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.795 = 79.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

The given timestamp is 2025-05-25 20:53:40 UTC, which is after the scheduled game time of 2:10 PM ET. So the game should have already taken place.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources to consider. The box score from Fox Sports [1] shows the final score as Rangers 5, White Sox 4. Another source from Plain Text Sports [14] confirms the final score as 5-4 in favor of the Rangers. Additionally, the ESPN AU page [6] lists the Rangers as the away team with a 25-28 record and the White Sox at 17-35 before the game, but the final result isn't directly mentioned there. However, the MLB.com video [13] and the Plain Text Sports box score [14] both indicate a Rangers victory.\n\nThere's a mention of a collision in the outfield during the sixth inning in the SoxMachine article [12], which contributed to the White Sox's six-run rally in their previous game, but that was on May 24th. The game in question here is on May 25th, which the sources [1][14] confirm as a Rangers win. \n\nI also need to check if there are any conflicting reports. The YouTube video [3] and CBS Sports recap [4] discuss the May 24th game where the White Sox won, but the May 25th game is a separate event. The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on the May 25th game, so the May 24th results are irrelevant here.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that p2 corresponds to the Rangers winning. Since multiple sources confirm the Rangers won 5-4 on May 25th, the correct resolution should be p2. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation, so the 50-50 resolution doesn't apply. All verified outcomes point to a Rangers victory.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748206420 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 20:53:40 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a response based on verified outcomes of the game or default to p4 if no verifiable information is available.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please verify the sources of information more rigorously and reconcile conflicting reports before making a recommendation. Consider the strong market sentiment favoring the Rangers in your analysis.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Rangers vs. White Sox game on May 25, 2025. The key here is to determine the outcome based on verified facts and the provided sources.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is 2025-05-25 20:53:40 UTC, which is after the scheduled game time of 2:10 PM ET. So the game should have already taken place.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources to consider. The box score from Fox Sports [1] shows the final score as Rangers 5, White Sox 4. Another source from Plain Text Sports [14] confirms the final score as 5-4 in favor of the Rangers. Additionally, the ESPN AU page [6] lists the Rangers as the away team with a 25-28 record and the White Sox at 17-35 before the game, but the final result isn't directly mentioned there. However, the MLB.com video [13] and the Plain Text Sports box score [14] both indicate a Rangers victory.\n\nThere's a mention of a collision in the outfield during the sixth inning in the SoxMachine article [12], which contributed to the White Sox's six-run rally in their previous game, but that was on May 24th. The game in question here is on May 25th, which the sources [1][14] confirm as a Rangers win. \n\nI also need to check if there are any conflicting reports. The YouTube video [3] and CBS Sports recap [4] discuss the May 24th game where the White Sox won, but the May 25th game is a separate event. The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution depends on the May 25th game, so the May 24th results are irrelevant here.\n\nThe resolution conditions state that p2 corresponds to the Rangers winning. Since multiple sources confirm the Rangers won 5-4 on May 25th, the correct resolution should be p2. There's no indication of postponement or cancellation, so the 50-50 resolution doesn't apply. All verified outcomes point to a Rangers victory.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Rangers, Price: 0.795, ID: 4799752102921647185787453082537088333063104444627603506817359605163829571029, Winner: No\n- Token: White Sox, Price: 0.205, ID: 46660957214232418169653657092628759264421752317887153732595868877768557857557, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to White Sox, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = White Sox, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.795 = 79.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
