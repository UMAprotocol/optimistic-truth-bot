      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the semifinal match between Alexander Zverev and Ben Shelton at the Boss Open on June 14, 2025. The current date is June 14, 2025, so the event is happening today. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the match has already occurred. The user provided a lot of search results, so I'll go through them to find any reports of the match result. The search results are from June 13 and 14, 2025. Most of them are previews or reports leading up to the semifinal, not the actual result. For example, sources [1], [3], [4], [11], [12], [23], [41], [52], [56], [59], [60], [61], [70] all discuss the upcoming match, predictions, and player stats but don't mention the outcome. \n\nI need to look for any sources that might have live updates or post-match reports. Source [25] is a live score page from Sofascore, but it's scheduled for June 14 at 12:00 UTC, which would be around the same time as the current timestamp (14:17:51 UTC). Since the match was set for 2:00 pm local time in Stuttgart (which is UTC+2), that would be 12:00 UTC. The current time is 14:17 UTC, so the match might still be ongoing or just concluded. However, none of the provided search results include post-match updates. \n\nSources like [27], [28], [40], [48], [54], [66] mention Zverev's quarterfinal win and setup against Shelton but don't go beyond that. There's no indication in any of the sources that the semifinal match has been played and resolved. Since the user's current timestamp is June 14, 2025, 14:17:51 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 12:00 UTC, it's possible the match is either ongoing or just finished, but without any results reported in the provided data. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if the match is delayed beyond July 14, 2025, it resolves to 50-50. However, the event date is today, so that clause doesn't apply yet. Since there's no evidence of the match result in the provided sources, and the event is scheduled for today but hasn't concluded as per the data, the resolution should be p3 (unknown/50-50). However, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the event is today, and the current time is after the scheduled start. Since the match is on the same day but later time (14:17 UTC vs. 12:00 UTC scheduled), it's still a future event relative to the current timestamp. Wait, the match was scheduled for 2:00 pm local time in Stuttgart, which is UTC+2, so 12:00 UTC. The current time is 14:17 UTC, which is 2 hours and 17 minutes after the scheduled start. A tennis match typically lasts 1.5-2 hours, so it's possible the match has concluded. However, none of the provided sources report the result. Since the user's instructions say to use the provided search results and if no info is available, answer as best as possible. Since all sources are pre-match, and no result is reported, and the event is on the same day but the current time is after the scheduled start, according to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4, but the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data defines p1 as Shelton, p2 as Zverev, p3 as 50-50. The personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4, but the resolution options here don't have p4. This might be a conflict. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. IMPORTANT: If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. The market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. However, the user's query includes ancillary data with resolution_conditions: p1: Shelton, p2: Zverev, p3: 50-50. The personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. But the market doesn't have a p4 option. This might be an error in the setup. However, according to the user's instructions, if the event is in the future, return p4, but the market only has p1, p2, p3. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to check if the event has already happened based on the current timestamp. The match was scheduled for June 14, 8:00 AM ET, which is 12:00 UTC. The current timestamp is June 14, 14:17:51 UTC, which is 2:17 PM UTC, so 2 hours and 17 minutes after the match's scheduled start. If the match was played as scheduled, it should have concluded by now. However, without any post-match sources, we can't confirm the result. According to the user's personalization: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The event date is today, which is the same day, but the time has passed. However, the personalization also states: \"If the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" In this case, the event was scheduled for 12:00 UTC, and the current time is 14:17 UTC, which is after the scheduled time. Wait, no\u2014if the event was scheduled for 12:00 UTC and it's now 14:17 UTC, the event is in the past. Therefore, the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp. Therefore, we need to check if there's any information about the outcome. Since all provided sources are from before the match, and there's no result reported, we have to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify what to do if there's no info, but the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on H2H (Zverev leads 2-0) and predictions in the sources (most pick Zverev to win). Therefore, the resolution would be p2 (Zverev). However, the user's instructions also say that if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is on the same day, and the time has passed, but no sources report the result, we have to go with the most probable outcome. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2: Zverev. But wait, the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So yes, in this case, since the event date is in the past (current time is after the scheduled time), and no info is available, we assume Zverev wins as the most probable outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to Shelton , p2 to Zverev, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749910671 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 14:17:51 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request regarding the outcome of the semifinal match between Alexander Zverev and Ben Shelton at the Boss Open on June 14, 2025. The current date is June 14, 2025, so the event is happening today. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the match has already occurred. The user provided a lot of search results, so I'll go through them to find any reports of the match result. The search results are from June 13 and 14, 2025. Most of them are previews or reports leading up to the semifinal, not the actual result. For example, sources [1], [3], [4], [11], [12], [23], [41], [52], [56], [59], [60], [61], [70] all discuss the upcoming match, predictions, and player stats but don't mention the outcome. \n\nI need to look for any sources that might have live updates or post-match reports. Source [25] is a live score page from Sofascore, but it's scheduled for June 14 at 12:00 UTC, which would be around the same time as the current timestamp (14:17:51 UTC). Since the match was set for 2:00 pm local time in Stuttgart (which is UTC+2), that would be 12:00 UTC. The current time is 14:17 UTC, so the match might still be ongoing or just concluded. However, none of the provided search results include post-match updates. \n\nSources like [27], [28], [40], [48], [54], [66] mention Zverev's quarterfinal win and setup against Shelton but don't go beyond that. There's no indication in any of the sources that the semifinal match has been played and resolved. Since the user's current timestamp is June 14, 2025, 14:17:51 UTC, and the match was scheduled for 12:00 UTC, it's possible the match is either ongoing or just finished, but without any results reported in the provided data. \n\nAdditionally, the resolution conditions state that if the match is delayed beyond July 14, 2025, it resolves to 50-50. However, the event date is today, so that clause doesn't apply yet. Since there's no evidence of the match result in the provided sources, and the event is scheduled for today but hasn't concluded as per the data, the resolution should be p3 (unknown/50-50). However, the user's personalization instructions mention that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But the event is today, and the current time is after the scheduled start. Since the match is on the same day but later time (14:17 UTC vs. 12:00 UTC scheduled), it's still a future event relative to the current timestamp. Wait, the match was scheduled for 2:00 pm local time in Stuttgart, which is UTC+2, so 12:00 UTC. The current time is 14:17 UTC, which is 2 hours and 17 minutes after the scheduled start. A tennis match typically lasts 1.5-2 hours, so it's possible the match has concluded. However, none of the provided sources report the result. Since the user's instructions say to use the provided search results and if no info is available, answer as best as possible. Since all sources are pre-match, and no result is reported, and the event is on the same day but the current time is after the scheduled start, according to the personalization rules, if the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to the current timestamp, return p4. Wait, the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4, but the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the ancillary data defines p1 as Shelton, p2 as Zverev, p3 as 50-50. The personalization says if the event is in the future, return p4, but the resolution options here don't have p4. This might be a conflict. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event. IMPORTANT: If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But the resolution conditions here are p1, p2, p3. The market's resolution conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. However, the user's query includes ancillary data with resolution_conditions: p1: Shelton, p2: Zverev, p3: 50-50. The personalization says to return p4 if the event is in the future. But the market doesn't have a p4 option. This might be an error in the setup. However, according to the user's instructions, if the event is in the future, return p4, but the market only has p1, p2, p3. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to check if the event has already happened based on the current timestamp. The match was scheduled for June 14, 8:00 AM ET, which is 12:00 UTC. The current timestamp is June 14, 14:17:51 UTC, which is 2:17 PM UTC, so 2 hours and 17 minutes after the match's scheduled start. If the match was played as scheduled, it should have concluded by now. However, without any post-match sources, we can't confirm the result. According to the user's personalization: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The event date is today, which is the same day, but the time has passed. However, the personalization also states: \"If the event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.\" In this case, the event was scheduled for 12:00 UTC, and the current time is 14:17 UTC, which is after the scheduled time. Wait, no\u2014if the event was scheduled for 12:00 UTC and it's now 14:17 UTC, the event is in the past. Therefore, the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp. Therefore, we need to check if there's any information about the outcome. Since all provided sources are from before the match, and there's no result reported, we have to assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify what to do if there's no info, but the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome. The most probable outcome based on H2H (Zverev leads 2-0) and predictions in the sources (most pick Zverev to win). Therefore, the resolution would be p2 (Zverev). However, the user's instructions also say that if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. But since the event is on the same day, and the time has passed, but no sources report the result, we have to go with the most probable outcome. Therefore, the recommendation would be p2: Zverev. But wait, the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So yes, in this case, since the event date is in the past (current time is after the scheduled time), and no info is available, we assume Zverev wins as the most probable outcome. Therefore, the recommendation is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Zverev, Price: 0.91, ID: 17241101820028260107702368310499753789376714607731702527513740482139923572520, Winner: No\n- Token: Shelton , Price: 0.09, ID: 23819250843766036770707197844115533241937051220357102225250304896831340715939, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Shelton , p2 to Zverev, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Shelton, p2 = Zverev\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Zverev outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.910 = 91.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
