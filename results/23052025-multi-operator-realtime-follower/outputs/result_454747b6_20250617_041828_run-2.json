Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nRoute to perplexity solver for further analysis\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552290\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.225, ID: 112966163854025059818661847516130715227727016580130231061428570068944485040691, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.775, ID: 114857146399825989044504827529714541570419775528840614772402669970848830793920, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.775 = 77.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 16, 11 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETH/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552290\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.225, ID: 112966163854025059818661847516130715227727016580130231061428570068944485040691, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.775, ID: 114857146399825989044504827529714541570419775528840614772402669970848830793920, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.775 = 77.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Ethereum Up or Down - June 16, 11 PM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for ETH/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the ETH/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ETH_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance ETH/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 552290\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.225, ID: 112966163854025059818661847516130715227727016580130231061428570068944485040691, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.775, ID: 114857146399825989044504827529714541570419775528840614772402669970848830793920, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.775 = 77.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether Ethereum's price went up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting June 16 at 11 PM ET on Binance's ETH/USDT pair. The current date is June 17, 2025, 4:08 AM UTC. First, I need to convert 11 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 11 PM ET is 3 AM UTC the next day. So the candle in question started at June 17, 3:00 AM UTC and ended at 4:00 AM UTC. The current time is 4:08 AM UTC, so the candle has just closed.\n\nLooking at the search results, I need to find the ETH/USDT price change for that specific 1-hour window. Search result [20] mentions that as of June 16, 22:40 PM UTC, Ethereum dropped below 2,600 USDT to 2,597.46. However, that's the previous day. The relevant time frame is June 17, 3:00-4:00 AM UTC. \n\nSearch result [47] from Blockchain.news states that as of 11:00 AM UTC on June 17, ETH is hovering near $2,550. But this is after the candle closed. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is 4:08 AM UTC. The candle closed at 4:00 AM UTC. The user provided data up to June 17, 4:08 AM UTC. Search result [6] from the Economic Times on June 16, 2025, mentions Ethereum trading at $2,542 with a 1.89% increase. However, this is from June 16, not the specific hour in question.\n\nSearch result [14] from Coin Edition on June 16, 2025, mentions Ethereum's price at $2,628, up 3% in 24 hours. But again, this is prior to the target hour.\n\nSearch result [48] from Binance Square on June 16, 22:40 PM UTC notes Ethereum dropped below 2,600 USDT to 2,597.46. But this is still June 16, not the June 17, 3-4 AM UTC window.\n\nWait, the user's query is about June 16, 11 PM ET, which is June 17, 3 AM UTC. The current time in the system is June 17, 4:08 AM UTC, so the candle has just closed. The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair. The change value displayed on the 1H candle at that time is needed.\n\nLooking at search result [40] from Coingecko, the 7-day price history for Binance Bridged USDT shows data up to June 17, but not specific hourly changes. \n\nSearch result [9] from CoinMarketCap shows the USDT to ETH conversion rate on June 17 as 0.0003887 ETH, but this is the daily close. \n\nSearch result [5] from Binance's Ethereum page mentions the Pectra upgrade and a live price of $2,585.44, but the timestamp isn't specific to the hour needed.\n\nSince the specific 1-hour window's data isn't explicitly provided in the search results, but the current time is just after the candle closed, I need to infer based on available data. If the price at 3:00 AM UTC was, say, $2,600 and at 4:00 AM UTC it's $2,597.46 (from [20]), the change would be negative. However, [20] is from June 16, 22:40 PM UTC, which is earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if the price increased during that hour, the change would be positive. Without explicit data for that exact hour, but knowing the current time is just after 4:00 AM UTC, and assuming the latest data points show a slight decrease, the resolution would be \"Down\" (p1). However, if the price increased during that hour, it's \"Up\" (p2). \n\nGiven the ambiguity in the search results, but considering the user's instruction to use Binance's data and the 1H candle's change, and if no explicit data contradicts, the safest approach is to check if any source mentions the specific hour's change. Since none do, but the current time allows the candle to have closed, the resolution would depend on the actual change. If the price at 4:00 AM UTC is higher than at 3:00 AM, then Up; else, Down. \n\nAssuming the price slightly decreased in that hour (as per [20] showing a drop below 2,600 earlier), but that's prior. Without concrete data, but given the system's current timestamp is just after the candle closed, and if the change is >=0, resolve to p2. Otherwise, p1. Since the user's provided search results don't have the exact data, but the query requires using Binance's data, and the answer must be based on the available context, I might have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event is in the past (June 16, 11 PM ET which is June 17, 3 AM UTC), and the current time is after that, but no data in the search results explicitly states the change, but the user instructions say to use the provided search results. \n\nWait, the search results include [20] which mentions Ethereum dropping below 2,600 USDT on June 16, 22:40 PM UTC, but that's before the target hour. [47] mentions ETH at $2,550 at 11:00 AM UTC on June 17, which is much later. The specific 1-hour window isn't covered. Since the resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair, and the change is displayed on their graph, but the provided search results don't include that exact data point, I might have to conclude that there's no verifiable information, hence p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If no data, but the market is about the 1H candle change, and assuming the price was stable or slightly down, but without data, it's unclear. However, the user's instructions say to answer based on provided search results. Since the search results don't have the exact 1H change for that window, but the current time is after the event, and the user is an oracle, the correct response would be p4 (cannot resolve). But the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The query's description says the market resolves to Up if the change is >=0. If the price didn't drop, it's Up. But without data, it's uncertain. However, the user might expect the assistant to infer from nearby data. For example, if the price was around $2,597 at 22:40 PM UTC on June 16, and then by 3 AM UTC June 17, maybe it increased. But this is speculative. Since the exact data isn't present, the safe answer is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The query's resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the instructions say to return p1, p2, p3, or p4. Since the event has occurred, but no data is provided in the search results for that specific hour, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750133296 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 04:08:16 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether Ethereum's price went up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting June 16 at 11 PM ET on Binance's ETH/USDT pair. The current date is June 17, 2025, 4:08 AM UTC. First, I need to convert 11 PM ET to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 11 PM ET is 3 AM UTC the next day. So the candle in question started at June 17, 3:00 AM UTC and ended at 4:00 AM UTC. The current time is 4:08 AM UTC, so the candle has just closed.\n\nLooking at the search results, I need to find the ETH/USDT price change for that specific 1-hour window. Search result [20] mentions that as of June 16, 22:40 PM UTC, Ethereum dropped below 2,600 USDT to 2,597.46. However, that's the previous day. The relevant time frame is June 17, 3:00-4:00 AM UTC. \n\nSearch result [47] from Blockchain.news states that as of 11:00 AM UTC on June 17, ETH is hovering near $2,550. But this is after the candle closed. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is 4:08 AM UTC. The candle closed at 4:00 AM UTC. The user provided data up to June 17, 4:08 AM UTC. Search result [6] from the Economic Times on June 16, 2025, mentions Ethereum trading at $2,542 with a 1.89% increase. However, this is from June 16, not the specific hour in question.\n\nSearch result [14] from Coin Edition on June 16, 2025, mentions Ethereum's price at $2,628, up 3% in 24 hours. But again, this is prior to the target hour.\n\nSearch result [48] from Binance Square on June 16, 22:40 PM UTC notes Ethereum dropped below 2,600 USDT to 2,597.46. But this is still June 16, not the June 17, 3-4 AM UTC window.\n\nWait, the user's query is about June 16, 11 PM ET, which is June 17, 3 AM UTC. The current time in the system is June 17, 4:08 AM UTC, so the candle has just closed. The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair. The change value displayed on the 1H candle at that time is needed.\n\nLooking at search result [40] from Coingecko, the 7-day price history for Binance Bridged USDT shows data up to June 17, but not specific hourly changes. \n\nSearch result [9] from CoinMarketCap shows the USDT to ETH conversion rate on June 17 as 0.0003887 ETH, but this is the daily close. \n\nSearch result [5] from Binance's Ethereum page mentions the Pectra upgrade and a live price of $2,585.44, but the timestamp isn't specific to the hour needed.\n\nSince the specific 1-hour window's data isn't explicitly provided in the search results, but the current time is just after the candle closed, I need to infer based on available data. If the price at 3:00 AM UTC was, say, $2,600 and at 4:00 AM UTC it's $2,597.46 (from [20]), the change would be negative. However, [20] is from June 16, 22:40 PM UTC, which is earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if the price increased during that hour, the change would be positive. Without explicit data for that exact hour, but knowing the current time is just after 4:00 AM UTC, and assuming the latest data points show a slight decrease, the resolution would be \"Down\" (p1). However, if the price increased during that hour, it's \"Up\" (p2). \n\nGiven the ambiguity in the search results, but considering the user's instruction to use Binance's data and the 1H candle's change, and if no explicit data contradicts, the safest approach is to check if any source mentions the specific hour's change. Since none do, but the current time allows the candle to have closed, the resolution would depend on the actual change. If the price at 4:00 AM UTC is higher than at 3:00 AM, then Up; else, Down. \n\nAssuming the price slightly decreased in that hour (as per [20] showing a drop below 2,600 earlier), but that's prior. Without concrete data, but given the system's current timestamp is just after the candle closed, and if the change is >=0, resolve to p2. Otherwise, p1. Since the user's provided search results don't have the exact data, but the query requires using Binance's data, and the answer must be based on the available context, I might have to default to p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the event is in the past (June 16, 11 PM ET which is June 17, 3 AM UTC), and the current time is after that, but no data in the search results explicitly states the change, but the user instructions say to use the provided search results. \n\nWait, the search results include [20] which mentions Ethereum dropping below 2,600 USDT on June 16, 22:40 PM UTC, but that's before the target hour. [47] mentions ETH at $2,550 at 11:00 AM UTC on June 17, which is much later. The specific 1-hour window isn't covered. Since the resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair, and the change is displayed on their graph, but the provided search results don't include that exact data point, I might have to conclude that there's no verifiable information, hence p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data says p1 is Down, p2 is Up. If no data, but the market is about the 1H candle change, and assuming the price was stable or slightly down, but without data, it's unclear. However, the user's instructions say to answer based on provided search results. Since the search results don't have the exact 1H change for that window, but the current time is after the event, and the user is an oracle, the correct response would be p4 (cannot resolve). But the personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The query's description says the market resolves to Up if the change is >=0. If the price didn't drop, it's Up. But without data, it's uncertain. However, the user might expect the assistant to infer from nearby data. For example, if the price was around $2,597 at 22:40 PM UTC on June 16, and then by 3 AM UTC June 17, maybe it increased. But this is speculative. Since the exact data isn't present, the safe answer is p4. But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The query's resolution conditions have p3 as 0.5, but the instructions say to return p1, p2, p3, or p4. Since the event has occurred, but no data is provided in the search results for that specific hour, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.225, ID: 112966163854025059818661847516130715227727016580130231061428570068944485040691, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.775, ID: 114857146399825989044504827529714541570419775528840614772402669970848830793920, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.775 = 77.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve whether Ethereum (ETH) against USDT had a price change of 0% or more in the 1-hour candle starting on June 16 at 11 PM ET. The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle once finalized.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact time window for the 1-hour candle. June 16, 11 PM ET converts to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 11 PM ET would be 3 AM UTC on June 17. The candle starts at 3:00 AM UTC and ends at 4:00 AM UTC. The current timestamp provided is June 17, 4:08:16 AM UTC, which is just after the candle closed. So the data should be available now.\n\nNext, I need to check the Binance API or reliable sources for the ETH/USDT 1H candle closing data around that time. The search results include several sources mentioning Binance's API endpoints for fetching klines/candlestick data. For example, sources [1], [3], and [30] detail how to retrieve historical klines using the Binance API, specifying the symbol (ETHUSDT), interval (1h), and the specific time range.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [5] mentions XRP's price movements but not ETH. Source [15] provides the current Ethereum price as $2,585.44, but that's the live price, not the specific 1H candle. Source [22] also lists the live price. However, the key is to get the 1H candle's open and close prices for the specified time.\n\nSource [30] explains the GET /api/v3/klines endpoint, which can fetch the required data. Parameters would be symbol=ETHUSDT, interval=1h, startTime=1718582400000 (June 17, 3:00 AM UTC in milliseconds), and endTime=1718586000000 (June 17, 4:00 AM UTC). The response includes open, high, low, close prices, etc.\n\nAssuming the API returns the candle, calculate the percentage change: ((close - open)/open)*100. If the result is >=0%, resolve to Up (p2); else, Down (p1). \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide the exact open and close values for that specific candle. Source [18] shows recent transactions but not aggregated 1H data. Source [28] on TradingView's ETHUSDT chart might have the data, but without direct access, I rely on the API.\n\nSince the current time is past the candle's close, the data should be available. If the change is >=0%, p2; else, p1. Without explicit data in the provided sources, but given the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if data isn't available, but since the event date is in the past and the data should exist, I need to infer.\n\nWait, the user's personalization mentions that if the event is in the past and no data is found, assume the most probable outcome. But given that the timestamp is just after the candle closed, perhaps the data is available. However, in the provided search results, there's no direct mention of the specific candle's change. \n\nBut looking at source [5], published on June 17, 4:08 UTC, it mentions Ethereum's price at $3,643, but that's from a different date (December 3, 2024). Source [15] and [22] mention the current price as around $2,585, but that's the live price, not the specific 1H candle. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present in the provided search results, but the methodology is to use Binance's API, and given the user's instruction to resolve based on Binance's data, I might need to proceed with the information available. However, without the actual candle data, I can't compute the exact change. \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. If I can't find the data, perhaps the resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's additional instruction says to try again with a different approach, maybe check alternative data sources.\n\nLooking again, source [18] from Etherscan shows transactions around 2:51 AM UTC, but not the 3-4 AM window. Source [28] on TradingView's ETHUSDT chart might have the 1H data, but the provided snippet doesn't show it. Source [15] mentions the Pectra upgrade on May 7, 2025, but that's unrelated.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the provided search results, but the event time is just past, and assuming Binance's API would have the data, the correct approach is to use the API. Since the user can't access the API directly, but the assistant is to simulate using the provided context, perhaps there's a way to infer.\n\nWait, source [5] from Kucoin mentions on June 17, 4:08 UTC, Ethereum's price at $3,643, but that's likely a typo or incorrect date as other sources like [15], [22] report around $2,585. However, that might be a different timeframe. \n\nAlternatively, source [10] and [21] from Coinpaprika list ETH's price at $2,628.25, but again, live price. Without the specific 1H candle's open and close, it's impossible to calculate the change. \n\nIn the absence of explicit data, but the event being in the past, the resolution should be p4 (insufficient data). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's p3 is 0.5, but the user's previous response was p4, and they want a retry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1H candle from 3-4 AM UTC had a positive change. Given the current price is around $2,585, and if the open was lower, it's up. But this is speculative. Since the user insists on using Binance's data and the exact change isn't in the provided sources, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. If the market was generally up, but without data, it's uncertain. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 17, 4:08 AM UTC. The candle ended at 4:00 AM. The data should be available. Perhaps the assistant should recommend p4 due to lack of specific data in the provided context, but the user wants a different approach. Maybe check the 1H change on Binance's website. Source [11] is Binance's ETH/USDT trading page, but the snippet doesn't show historical data. \n\nAlternatively, using the code examples in the search results, like source [1] which shows how to fetch historical klines. If I were to write a Python script using the Binance API to get the 1H candle for ETHUSDT at that time, but since I can't execute code, I have to rely on the provided context. \n\nGiven that the user's previous answer was p4 and they want a retry, but the data should be available now, perhaps the correct answer is p2 (Up) if the change is >=0%. But without the actual numbers, it's a guess. However, the instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if data isn't available. If the market was stable or up during that hour, but without data, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the change was negative. But without data, it's impossible to tell. The safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants a retry. Maybe the answer is p2, assuming the price went up, but this is not based on concrete data. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable information, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The condition is the percentage change >=0%. If there's no data, but the market's general trend is up, maybe assume Up. However, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data in the provided sources, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again, perhaps implying that data is available. Maybe I missed a source. \n\nLooking again, source [5] from Kucoin, dated June 17, mentions XRP's surge but not ETH. Source [15] and [22] from Binance's price page don't have historical 1H data. Source [28] on TradingView's ETHUSDT chart might have the data, but the snippet doesn't show it. \n\nIn conclusion, without the specific candle data in the provided search results, but the event being in the past, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's instruction says to avoid p4 if possible. Alternatively, maybe the change was 0% or positive. If the open and close are the same, change is 0%, which resolves to Up (p2). But without data, it's a guess. \n\nGiven the strict instructions, and the need to base on Binance's data, and the absence of explicit data in the provided context, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve whether Ethereum (ETH) against USDT had a price change of 0% or more in the 1-hour candle starting on June 16 at 11 PM ET. The resolution source is Binance's ETH/USDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle once finalized.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exact time window for the 1-hour candle. June 16, 11 PM ET converts to UTC. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 11 PM ET would be 3 AM UTC on June 17. The candle starts at 3:00 AM UTC and ends at 4:00 AM UTC. The current timestamp provided is June 17, 4:08:16 AM UTC, which is just after the candle closed. So the data should be available now.\n\nNext, I need to check the Binance API or reliable sources for the ETH/USDT 1H candle closing data around that time. The search results include several sources mentioning Binance's API endpoints for fetching klines/candlestick data. For example, sources [1], [3], and [30] detail how to retrieve historical klines using the Binance API, specifying the symbol (ETHUSDT), interval (1h), and the specific time range.\n\nLooking at the search results, source [5] mentions XRP's price movements but not ETH. Source [15] provides the current Ethereum price as $2,585.44, but that's the live price, not the specific 1H candle. Source [22] also lists the live price. However, the key is to get the 1H candle's open and close prices for the specified time.\n\nSource [30] explains the GET /api/v3/klines endpoint, which can fetch the required data. Parameters would be symbol=ETHUSDT, interval=1h, startTime=1718582400000 (June 17, 3:00 AM UTC in milliseconds), and endTime=1718586000000 (June 17, 4:00 AM UTC). The response includes open, high, low, close prices, etc.\n\nAssuming the API returns the candle, calculate the percentage change: ((close - open)/open)*100. If the result is >=0%, resolve to Up (p2); else, Down (p1). \n\nHowever, the search results don't provide the exact open and close values for that specific candle. Source [18] shows recent transactions but not aggregated 1H data. Source [28] on TradingView's ETHUSDT chart might have the data, but without direct access, I rely on the API.\n\nSince the current time is past the candle's close, the data should be available. If the change is >=0%, p2; else, p1. Without explicit data in the provided sources, but given the user's instruction to assume the most probable outcome if data isn't available, but since the event date is in the past and the data should exist, I need to infer.\n\nWait, the user's personalization mentions that if the event is in the past and no data is found, assume the most probable outcome. But given that the timestamp is just after the candle closed, perhaps the data is available. However, in the provided search results, there's no direct mention of the specific candle's change. \n\nBut looking at source [5], published on June 17, 4:08 UTC, it mentions Ethereum's price at $3,643, but that's from a different date (December 3, 2024). Source [15] and [22] mention the current price as around $2,585, but that's the live price, not the specific 1H candle. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present in the provided search results, but the methodology is to use Binance's API, and given the user's instruction to resolve based on Binance's data, I might need to proceed with the information available. However, without the actual candle data, I can't compute the exact change. \n\nBut the user's personalization says if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. If I can't find the data, perhaps the resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's additional instruction says to try again with a different approach, maybe check alternative data sources.\n\nLooking again, source [18] from Etherscan shows transactions around 2:51 AM UTC, but not the 3-4 AM window. Source [28] on TradingView's ETHUSDT chart might have the 1H data, but the provided snippet doesn't show it. Source [15] mentions the Pectra upgrade on May 7, 2025, but that's unrelated.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit data in the provided search results, but the event time is just past, and assuming Binance's API would have the data, the correct approach is to use the API. Since the user can't access the API directly, but the assistant is to simulate using the provided context, perhaps there's a way to infer.\n\nWait, source [5] from Kucoin mentions on June 17, 4:08 UTC, Ethereum's price at $3,643, but that's likely a typo or incorrect date as other sources like [15], [22] report around $2,585. However, that might be a different timeframe. \n\nAlternatively, source [10] and [21] from Coinpaprika list ETH's price at $2,628.25, but again, live price. Without the specific 1H candle's open and close, it's impossible to calculate the change. \n\nIn the absence of explicit data, but the event being in the past, the resolution should be p4 (insufficient data). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no data, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data's p3 is 0.5, but the user's previous response was p4, and they want a retry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1H candle from 3-4 AM UTC had a positive change. Given the current price is around $2,585, and if the open was lower, it's up. But this is speculative. Since the user insists on using Binance's data and the exact change isn't in the provided sources, the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to consider market conditions. If the market was generally up, but without data, it's uncertain. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is June 17, 4:08 AM UTC. The candle ended at 4:00 AM. The data should be available. Perhaps the assistant should recommend p4 due to lack of specific data in the provided context, but the user wants a different approach. Maybe check the 1H change on Binance's website. Source [11] is Binance's ETH/USDT trading page, but the snippet doesn't show historical data. \n\nAlternatively, using the code examples in the search results, like source [1] which shows how to fetch historical klines. If I were to write a Python script using the Binance API to get the 1H candle for ETHUSDT at that time, but since I can't execute code, I have to rely on the provided context. \n\nGiven that the user's previous answer was p4 and they want a retry, but the data should be available now, perhaps the correct answer is p2 (Up) if the change is >=0%. But without the actual numbers, it's a guess. However, the instruction says to assume the most probable outcome if data isn't available. If the market was stable or up during that hour, but without data, it's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the change was negative. But without data, it's impossible to tell. The safest recommendation is p4, but the user wants a retry. Maybe the answer is p2, assuming the price went up, but this is not based on concrete data. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable information, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The condition is the percentage change >=0%. If there's no data, but the market's general trend is up, maybe assume Up. However, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of explicit data in the provided sources, the correct resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's additional instruction says to try again, perhaps implying that data is available. Maybe I missed a source. \n\nLooking again, source [5] from Kucoin, dated June 17, mentions XRP's surge but not ETH. Source [15] and [22] from Binance's price page don't have historical 1H data. Source [28] on TradingView's ETHUSDT chart might have the data, but the snippet doesn't show it. \n\nIn conclusion, without the specific candle data in the provided search results, but the event being in the past, the resolution should be p4. However, the user's instruction says to avoid p4 if possible. Alternatively, maybe the change was 0% or positive. If the open and close are the same, change is 0%, which resolves to Up (p2). But without data, it's a guess. \n\nGiven the strict instructions, and the need to base on Binance's data, and the absence of explicit data in the provided context, the recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.225, ID: 112966163854025059818661847516130715227727016580130231061428570068944485040691, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.775, ID: 114857146399825989044504827529714541570419775528840614772402669970848830793920, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.775 = 77.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750133296 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 04:08:16 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the response utilizes direct data from the specified source (Binance) for the ETH/USDT pair to determine the price change. If direct data access is an issue, consider methodologies that can infer the outcome based on closely related data points available up to the event time.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking about resolving a market that depends on whether the ETH/USDT price on Binance went up or down in the 1-hour candle starting June 16 at 11 PM ET. The current timestamp is June 17, 2025, 4:08:16 UTC. First, I need to convert the event time from ET to UTC to match the data sources.\n\nJune 16, 11 PM ET is the same as June 17, 3 AM UTC because ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time. The candle in question is the 1-hour period from 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM UTC on June 17. The user provided search results include data up to June 17, but I need to check if there's specific data for that exact hour.\n\nLooking at the search results, several sources mention Binance's ETH/USDT pair. For example, result [6] from the Economic Times on June 16 mentions Ethereum trading at $2,542 with a 1.89% increase. However, this is as of June 15. Result [25] from Binance Square News on June 16 at 22:40 UTC notes ETH dropped below 2,600 USDT. Result [26] from Blockchain.News on June 16 at 10:00 AM UTC reports a 12.5% increase, but that's earlier in the day. \n\nResult [52] from CoinGecko's historical data shows the price on June 17 as N/A, but June 16's close is $2,561.33. Result [15] lists the ETH/USDT price on CoinGecko as $2,607.02. However, none of these specify the exact 3:00-4:00 AM UTC hour. \n\nThe user's personalization instructions emphasize using Binance data directly. Since the exact 1-hour candle data isn't explicitly found in the provided sources, but the current time is past the event, I should infer based on available data. If the price after 4:00 AM UTC is higher than at 3:00 AM, it's up. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data for that hour, but considering the market's requirement to resolve based on Binance's displayed change for that candle, and assuming the event has passed, the most probable outcome is to check if the close was higher than the open. If no data contradicts, and given the general uptrend in some sources, it's likely resolved to Up (p2). However, without explicit data, there's uncertainty. But the user's instruction says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the market resolves based on Binance's data, and if the change is >=0, it's Up. If the close is equal or higher, then p2. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's prior instruction to return p4 if unresolved, but the event is past, I should recommend p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.225, ID: 112966163854025059818661847516130715227727016580130231061428570068944485040691, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.775, ID: 114857146399825989044504827529714541570419775528840614772402669970848830793920, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.775 = 77.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1750133296 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-17 04:08:16 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure the response utilizes direct data from the specified source (Binance) for the ETH/USDT pair to determine the price change. If direct data access is an issue, consider methodologies that can infer the outcome based on closely related data points available up to the event time."

        "critique": "The response from the solver attempts to infer the outcome based on partial and indirect data sources, which do not provide a clear picture of the specific event time frame required by the query. The solver acknowledges the lack of explicit data for the exact hour in question and bases the recommendation on general trends and assumptions rather than concrete evidence from the specified source (Binance). This approach does not meet the precision required for a definitive resolution. Furthermore, the market sentiment strongly favors a 'Down' outcome, which directly contradicts the solver's recommendation of 'Up'.",
