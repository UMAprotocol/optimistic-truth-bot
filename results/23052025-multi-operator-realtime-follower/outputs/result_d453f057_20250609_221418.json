      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ross Ulbricht said \"Trump\" three or more times during his Bitcoin 2025 appearance on May 29. The resolution depends on the video of the event, and the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump in Ulbricht's speech. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it mentions that Trump pardoned Ulbricht and that he's speaking at the conference. However, there's no direct quote from Ulbricht's speech mentioning Trump. The article quotes Trump's pardon announcement but doesn't indicate Ulbricht's own words during the event.\n\nSource [2] discusses Ulbricht's speech themes: freedom, decentralization, unity. It quotes him thanking the community for support but doesn't mention Trump.

But the article doesn't specify if this was during the Bitcoin 2025 speech. Wait, the article's date is 2025-06-01, which is after May 29, so it's possible this was part of his speech.

The user's query requires three or more mentions. Since the sources don't indicate more than one mention, the answer should resolve to \"No.\" However, I need to ensure that the quote from sources [3], [12], [13], and [14] is indeed from the May 29 event. All these sources reference the Bitcoin 2025 conference, which aligns with the event date. But even if that's the case, only one mention is recorded.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749506460 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 22:01:00 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ross Ulbricht said \"Trump\" three or more times during his Bitcoin 2025 appearance on May 29. The resolution depends on the video of the event, and the market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any mentions of Trump in Ulbricht's speech. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it mentions that Trump pardoned Ulbricht and that he's speaking at the conference. However, there's no direct quote from Ulbricht's speech mentioning Trump. The article quotes Trump's pardon announcement but doesn't indicate Ulbricht's own words during the event.\n\nSource [2] discusses Ulbricht's speech themes: freedom, decentralization, unity. It quotes him thanking the community for support but doesn't mention Trump. The focus is on Bitcoin principles, not political figures.\n\nSource [3] includes a quote from Ulbricht: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one mention of Trump. But the article doesn't specify if this was during the Bitcoin 2025 speech. Wait, the article's date is 2025-06-01, which is after May 29, so it's possible this was part of his speech.

No mention of Trump in his address here.\n\nSource [9] is Trump's 2024 speech transcript, not relevant to Ulbricht's 2025 speech.\n\nSource [10] discusses Trump's 2024 pledge to commute Ulbricht's sentence.

Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 14839849403846142301979037311193522354697930674532983193861062955110853951163, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 106935227715705910911110760745200757536480858467824133911547550361851935615332, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of Ulbricht's speech and any transcripts or summaries that might include his exact words. The key here is to count how many times \"Trump\" was said. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it mentions Ulbricht was pardoned by Trump and that he's speaking at the conference, but there's no transcript. Source [2] talks about his speech focusing on freedom, decentralization, and unity, but no mention of Trump. Source [3] includes parts of his speech where he thanks Trump for the pardon. Wait, here it says: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one mention.\n\nSource [4] describes his speech but doesn't mention Trump. Source [5] also discusses his principles but not Trump. Source [6] is a video, but the description doesn't specify Trump mentions. Source [7] notes his release due to Trump's pardon but doesn't quote the speech. Source [8] says he expressed gratitude to Trump, so that's another mention. Source [9] in Nigerian Pidgin mentions he thanked Trump, which is another instance. Source [10] talks about the pardon but not the speech. Source [11] quotes him saying \"We even got President Trump to see...\" which might be the same as in [3]. Source [13] mentions his gratitude to Trump. Source [15] is about Trump's pledge to free him. Source [16] includes a transcript where he says, \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Source [17] repeats the same quote.\n\nWait, in source [8], it's stated: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump and supporters who called for his release from prison.\" That's another mention. So in the speech, he thanked Trump directly. Let's tally:\n\n1. \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" [3][17]\n2. Expressing gratitude to Trump during the speech [8][9]\n3. Any other instances? Let me check again. Source [16] in the transcript has him saying, \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one mention. Then in [8], he thanks Trump, which is a second mention. Are there more?\n\nLooking at source [7]: \"His release followed a presidential pardon signed by President Donald Trump in January 2025...\" but that's context, not part of the speech. Source [13] mentions his gratitude, but again, not a direct quote. Source [9] says he thanked Trump in his speech. So in the actual speech, he might have mentioned Trump at least twice: once when talking about the pardon and once when discussing how the community got Trump to support Bitcoin. Wait, maybe that's the same instance. Let me clarify.\n\nIn source [3] and [17], the quote is about getting Trump to see Bitcoin's future. In source [8], he thanks Trump during the speech. So that's two mentions. Is there a third? Let me check source [16] again. The transcript there includes: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Then, in the same transcript, he says, \"I\u2019m talking about freedom beyond what anyone, anywhere, has ever had. It\u2019s going to be incredible. And it\u2019s going to be worth fighting for.\" No mention there. Then later, \"His pardon, announced shortly after Trump returned to office...\" but that's part of the article, not the speech.\n\nWait, source [8] explicitly states: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump and supporters who called for his release from prison.\" So during the speech, he thanked Trump. That's one mention. Then in the quote from [3][17], he mentions Trump again in the context of getting him to support Bitcoin. That's two mentions. Are there any other instances?\n\nLooking at source [11]: \"Ulbricht, referring to Bitcoiners, whom he credited for helping with his release.\" But the quote there is: \u201cWe even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\u201d So that's the same as before. So total two mentions. \n\nWait, maybe in the actual speech, he mentioned Trump more than once. For example, when thanking him and when discussing the pardon's impact. But according to the sources, the explicit mentions are two. The user's query requires three or more. Since the sources only show two mentions, the answer should be \"No\". However, the user added an instruction to re-evaluate considering strong market sentiment for 'Yes'. But based on the provided sources, there's no evidence of three mentions. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, in source [9], it's stated: \"Ross Ulbricht Don Come Back After Trump Forgive Am ... 2025-06-01 For im speech, Ulbricht talk say e dey very grateful to crypto community and Trump because dem help am come out.\" This is in Nigerian Pidgin, translating to Ulbricht being grateful to Trump in his speech. That's another mention. So that's three: 1. Thanking Trump, 2. Mentioning getting Trump to support Bitcoin, 3. Another instance in [9]. Wait, but maybe these are overlapping. Let me parse each source again.\n\nSource [3]: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" [3][17] \u2013 1 mention.\n\nSource [8]: \"expressed his gratitude to U.S. President Trump\" \u2013 2nd mention.\n\nSource [9]: \"talk say e dey very grateful to crypto community and Trump\" \u2013 same as source [8], so same mention.\n\nSo total two distinct mentions. Therefore, the count is two, which is less than three. Hence, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's additional instruction says to consider any additional context explaining strong market sentiment for 'Yes'. Maybe there's a source I missed. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at source [16], the transcript includes: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Then, in the same transcript, he says, \"His pardon, announced shortly after Trump returned to office...\" but that's part of the article, not the speech. Wait, no\u2014source [16] is a transcript of his speech? Let me check. Source [16] is a Substack post that includes a transcript. The relevant part: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one mention. Then, in the same speech, does he mention Trump again? The transcript in [16] also says: \"His pardon, announced shortly after Trump returned to office...\" but that's the author's commentary, not part of Ulbricht's speech. So in the actual speech, only one mention. Wait, but source [8] says he expressed gratitude to Trump, which would be another mention. So in the speech, he both thanked Trump and mentioned getting him to support Bitcoin. That's two mentions. Therefore, the count is two, which is less than three. Hence, the answer is \"No\" (p1). But the market resolves to \"Yes\" if three or more. Therefore, the recommendation is p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749506460 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 22:01:00 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the sources and consider any additional information or context that might explain the strong market sentiment for a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ross Ulbricht said \"Trump\" three or more times during his Bitcoin 2025 speech on May 29. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of Ulbricht's speech and any transcripts or summaries that might include his exact words. The key here is to count how many times \"Trump\" was said. Let's go through each source.\n\nLooking at source [1], it mentions Ulbricht was pardoned by Trump and that he's speaking at the conference, but there's no transcript. Source [2] talks about his speech focusing on freedom, decentralization, and unity, but no mention of Trump. Source [3] includes parts of his speech where he thanks Trump for the pardon. Wait, here it says: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one mention.\n\nSource [4] describes his speech but doesn't mention Trump. Source [5] also discusses his principles but not Trump. Source [6] is a video, but the description doesn't specify Trump mentions. Source [7] notes his release due to Trump's pardon but doesn't quote the speech. Source [8] says he expressed gratitude to Trump, so that's another mention. Source [9] in Nigerian Pidgin mentions he thanked Trump, which is another instance. Source [10] talks about the pardon but not the speech. Source [11] quotes him saying \"We even got President Trump to see...\" which might be the same as in [3]. Source [13] mentions his gratitude to Trump. Source [15] is about Trump's pledge to free him. Source [16] includes a transcript where he says, \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Source [17] repeats the same quote.\n\nWait, in source [8], it's stated: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump and supporters who called for his release from prison.\" That's another mention. So in the speech, he thanked Trump directly. Let's tally:\n\n1. \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" [3][17]\n2. Expressing gratitude to Trump during the speech [8][9]\n3. Any other instances? Let me check again. Source [16] in the transcript has him saying, \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one mention. Then in [8], he thanks Trump, which is a second mention. Are there more?\n\nLooking at source [7]: \"His release followed a presidential pardon signed by President Donald Trump in January 2025...\" but that's context, not part of the speech. Source [13] mentions his gratitude, but again, not a direct quote. Source [9] says he thanked Trump in his speech. So in the actual speech, he might have mentioned Trump at least twice: once when talking about the pardon and once when discussing how the community got Trump to support Bitcoin. Wait, maybe that's the same instance. Let me clarify.\n\nIn source [3] and [17], the quote is about getting Trump to see Bitcoin's future. In source [8], he thanks Trump during the speech. So that's two mentions. Is there a third? Let me check source [16] again. The transcript there includes: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Then, in the same transcript, he says, \"I\u2019m talking about freedom beyond what anyone, anywhere, has ever had. It\u2019s going to be incredible. And it\u2019s going to be worth fighting for.\" No mention there. Then later, \"His pardon, announced shortly after Trump returned to office...\" but that's part of the article, not the speech.\n\nWait, source [8] explicitly states: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump and supporters who called for his release from prison.\" So during the speech, he thanked Trump. That's one mention. Then in the quote from [3][17], he mentions Trump again in the context of getting him to support Bitcoin. That's two mentions. Are there any other instances?\n\nLooking at source [11]: \"Ulbricht, referring to Bitcoiners, whom he credited for helping with his release.\" But the quote there is: \u201cWe even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\u201d So that's the same as before. So total two mentions. \n\nWait, maybe in the actual speech, he mentioned Trump more than once. For example, when thanking him and when discussing the pardon's impact. But according to the sources, the explicit mentions are two. The user's query requires three or more. Since the sources only show two mentions, the answer should be \"No\". However, the user added an instruction to re-evaluate considering strong market sentiment for 'Yes'. But based on the provided sources, there's no evidence of three mentions. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, in source [9], it's stated: \"Ross Ulbricht Don Come Back After Trump Forgive Am ... 2025-06-01 For im speech, Ulbricht talk say e dey very grateful to crypto community and Trump because dem help am come out.\" This is in Nigerian Pidgin, translating to Ulbricht being grateful to Trump in his speech. That's another mention. So that's three: 1. Thanking Trump, 2. Mentioning getting Trump to support Bitcoin, 3. Another instance in [9]. Wait, but maybe these are overlapping. Let me parse each source again.\n\nSource [3]: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" [3][17] \u2013 1 mention.\n\nSource [8]: \"expressed his gratitude to U.S. President Trump\" \u2013 2nd mention.\n\nSource [9]: \"talk say e dey very grateful to crypto community and Trump\" \u2013 same as source [8], so same mention.\n\nSo total two distinct mentions. Therefore, the count is two, which is less than three. Hence, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's additional instruction says to consider any additional context explaining strong market sentiment for 'Yes'. Maybe there's a source I missed. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at source [16], the transcript includes: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Then, in the same transcript, he says, \"His pardon, announced shortly after Trump returned to office...\" but that's part of the article, not the speech.

So in the speech, he both thanked Trump and mentioned getting him to support Bitcoin. That's two mentions. Therefore, the count is two, which is less than three. Hence, the answer is \"No\" (p1). But the market resolves to \"Yes\" if three or more. Therefore, the recommendation is p1 (No).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 14839849403846142301979037311193522354697930674532983193861062955110853951163, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 106935227715705910911110760745200757536480858467824133911547550361851935615332, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Search result [40] again has the same quote. Still two.\n5. Search result [70] mentions his release was due to Trump's pardon, but in the speech, he thanks Trump. So that's another mention. Wait, in [8], he says, \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's two mentions.

Let me check each source again:\n\n- [3]: 1 mention\n- [8]: 1 mention (same as [3])\n- [27]: 1 mention (same)\n- [40]: 1 mention (same)\n- [70]: 1 mention (same)\n- [72]: \"In January, pro-crypto President Donald Trump signed an executive order...\" but this is context, not part of the speech.\n\nWait, the actual speech content in the sources only shows one mention of Trump.

But the user needs three or more. None of the search results indicate multiple mentions. All references to Trump in the speech are the same single instance. Therefore, the count is less than three. \n\nTherefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5).

The user wants to know if Ross Ulbricht said \"Trump\" three or more times during his Bitcoin 2025 speech on May 29. The resolution depends on the video of the event. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for mentions of Trump in Ulbricht's speech. Looking through the sources:\n\n1. Search result [3] mentions Ulbricht said, \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one mention.\n2. Search result [8] quotes him thanking Trump: \"Now I\u2019m free, and it\u2019s because of you... We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's two mentions.\n3. Search result [27] repeats the same quote as [3], so another mention here, but it's the same instance. Wait, maybe it's the same speech, so it's still two.\n4. Search result [40] again has the same quote. Still two.\n5. Search result [70] mentions his release was due to Trump's pardon, but in the speech, he thanks Trump. So that's another mention. Wait, in [8], he says, \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's two mentions. Are there more?\n\nWait, looking at [16], Ulbricht's speech included: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one. Then in [27], same quote. Maybe he only mentioned Trump once. But in [8], he also says, \"Now I\u2019m free, and it\u2019s because of you... you even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" So that's two mentions? Or is it the same instance?\n\nWait, the user's query is about the number of times \"Trump\" was said. Let me check each source again:\n\n- [3]: 1 mention\n- [8]: 1 mention (same as [3])\n- [27]: 1 mention (same)\n- [40]: 1 mention (same)\n- [70]: 1 mention (same)\n- [72]: \"In January, pro-crypto President Donald Trump signed an executive order...\" but this is context, not part of the speech.\n\nWait, the actual speech content in the sources only shows one mention of Trump. However, in [8], the transcript includes: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one instance. Are there other instances?\n\nLooking at [16], the speech transcript there also includes the same line. So, only one mention. But wait, in [8], he also says, \"Now I\u2019m free, and it\u2019s because of you... you even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" So that's one mention of Trump. \n\nWait, maybe he mentioned Trump once. But the user needs three or more. None of the search results indicate multiple mentions. All references to Trump in the speech are the same single instance. Therefore, the count is less than three. \n\nTherefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5). Wait, the resolution conditions are p2 for Yes (if he said it 3+ times), p1 for No. Since he only mentioned Trump once, the answer is No, so p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 14839849403846142301979037311193522354697930674532983193861062955110853951163, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 106935227715705910911110760745200757536480858467824133911547550361851935615332, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ross Ulbricht mentioned \"Trump\" three or more times during his Bitcoin 2025 speech on May 29. The resolution depends on the exact count of the word \"Trump\" in that specific appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to review the provided search results. The key sources are the transcripts and articles about Ulbricht's speech. Let's look through them.\n\nFrom source [2], the transcript of Ulbricht's speech mentions: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one mention.\n\nSource [3] states: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Same as above, so that's the same instance.\n\nSource [4] doesn't mention Trump in the speech content provided.\n\nSource [5] discusses his speech but doesn't cite Trump mentions.\n\nSource [6] includes a quote: \"Pardoned earlier this year by former President Donald Trump...\" but this is part of the article's narrative, not the speech itself.\n\nSource [8] quotes Ulbricht: \"you even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Again, the same instance.\n\nSource [18] mentions Ulbricht expressing gratitude to Trump, but the exact quote is: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump...\" which might be part of his speech. If he said \"President Trump\" during the speech, that's another mention.\n\nWait, looking at source [18], the exact line is: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump and supporters who called for his release from prison.\" This is part of the article's reporting. But if Ulbricht actually said \"President Trump\" in his speech, that would count. The article's wording might be paraphrasing, so need to check if it's a direct quote.\n\nSource [36] includes a quote from Ulbricht's speech: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's the same as before.\n\nSource [38] quotes him: \"You even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future. Yeah, you did that.\" Here, \"President Trump\" is mentioned once, and \"Trump\" again in \"got Trump to see...\" So that's two mentions in this source.\n\nWait, in source [38], the exact quote is: \u201cYou even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future. Yeah, you did that. You got him to see that decentralization and freedom are our future. You said, \u2018Ross is one of us.\u2019 You stayed united. You said, \u2018We want Ross out here with us.\u2019 You said, \u2018Free Ross.\u2019 You did this.\u201d Here, \"President Trump\" and \"Trump\" are both used. Wait, \"got President Trump\" and then \"got him\" refers to Trump. So that's one mention of \"Trump\" as part of \"President Trump\" and another as \"Trump\"?\n\nWait, no. The first mention is \"President Trump,\" which includes \"Trump,\" so that's one. Then \"got him\" refers to Trump, but \"him\" isn't the word \"Trump.\" So only one mention here.\n\nLooking at source [65], the article states: \"Ulbricht explained that, in the early days of the Silk Road, he wanted to grow hallucinogenic mushrooms...\" but no mention of Trump in the speech content provided.\n\nSource [66] mentions his speech but doesn't cite Trump mentions.\n\nSource [67] discusses his speech but doesn't mention Trump.\n\nSource [68] includes: \"You even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Again, same as before.\n\nSource [69] doesn't mention Trump in the speech.\n\nSo from the sources, the direct mentions of \"Trump\" in Ulbricht's speech are:\n\n1. \"President Trump\" in [2], [3], [8], [36], [38], [68] \u2013 these all seem to refer to the same instance in the speech.\n\n2. In source [18], the article states he expressed gratitude to Trump, but it's unclear if he said \"Trump\" or \"President Trump\" in the speech. If he did, that's another mention.\n\nWait, let's check source [18] again: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump and supporters who called for his release from prison.\" If this is a direct quote, then \"President Trump\" is mentioned. If it's a paraphrase, then maybe not. The exact wording in the speech isn't provided here, so we can't be certain.\n\nAnother possible mention is in source [38], where he says, \"You even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future. Yeah, you did that.\" Here, \"President Trump\" is once. Then later in the same speech, he might have referred to Trump again, but the sources don't show that.\n\nLooking at source [43], which is about Trump's pardon, but the speech content isn't mentioned.\n\nSource [27] mentions Trump's pardon but not in the speech.\n\nSo based on the provided sources, the only explicit mention of \"Trump\" in Ulbricht's speech is once, as \"President Trump.\" The other references in the articles are either paraphrases or part of the article's narrative, not direct quotes from the speech.\n\nTherefore, the count of \"Trump\" mentions in the speech is one. Since the user's query requires three or more mentions for \"Yes\" (p2), the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's additional instruction says to \"re-evaluate the sources and verify the number of mentions of 'Trump' in Ross Ulbricht's speech, considering the strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes'.\" \n\nWait, the personalization section says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the sources and verify the number of mentions of 'Trump' in Ross Ulbricht's speech, considering the strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes'.\" So even if the sources only show one mention, but the market sentiment is strong for \"Yes,\" maybe there's a discrepancy. However, the resolution must be based on the actual speech content.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I missed other mentions. Let me check all sources again.\n\nSource [38] in the transcript: \u201cYou even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future. Yeah, you did that. You got him to see that decentralization and freedom are our future. You said, \u2018Ross is one of us.\u2019 You stayed united. You said, \u2018We want Ross out here with us.\u2019 You said, \u2018Free Ross.\u2019 You did this.\u201d Here, \"President Trump\" is mentioned once. Then \"got him\" refers to Trump, but \"him\" isn't the word \"Trump.\" So only one mention.\n\nSource [68]: \"You even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Again, same as above.\n\nSource [36]: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Same.\n\nSource [2]: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Same.\n\nSo all these sources point to one mention of \"Trump\" as part of \"President Trump.\" No other instances are found in the provided search results. Therefore, the count is one, which is less than three. Thus, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's additional note mentions strong market sentiment favoring \"Yes,\" but the factual analysis based on sources shows only one mention. Therefore, despite market sentiment, the resolution should be based on the actual count.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Analysis:**  \nBased on the provided search results, Ross Ulbricht explicitly mentioned \"Trump\" **once** during his Bitcoin 2025 speech, specifically in the context of acknowledging Trump\u2019s role in his pardon and Bitcoin advocacy:  \n- **Direct quote**: \u201cWe even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future\u201d [2][3][8][36][38][68].  \n\nNo additional instances of the term \u201cTrump\u201d (including pluralizations, possessives, or compound words) were identified in transcripts or summaries of his speech. While market sentiment may favor \u201cYes,\u201d the evidence confirms only **one valid mention**, falling short of the required three.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The market resolves to **No (p1)**.",

If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749506460 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 22:01:00 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the sources and verify the number of mentions of 'Trump' in Ross Ulbricht's speech, considering the strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes'.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ross Ulbricht mentioned \"Trump\" three or more times during his Bitcoin 2025 speech on May 29. The resolution depends on the exact count of the word \"Trump\" in that specific appearance.\n\nFirst, I need to review the provided search results. The key sources are the transcripts and articles about Ulbricht's speech. Let's look through them.\n\nFrom source [2], the transcript of Ulbricht's speech mentions: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one mention.\n\nSource [3] states: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Same as above, so that's the same instance.\n\nSource [4] doesn't mention Trump in the speech content provided.\n\nSource [5] discusses his speech but doesn't cite Trump mentions.\n\nSource [6] includes a quote: \"Pardoned earlier this year by former President Donald Trump...\" but this is part of the article's narrative, not the speech itself.\n\nSource [8] quotes Ulbricht: \"you even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Again, the same instance.\n\nSource [18] mentions Ulbricht expressing gratitude to Trump, but the exact quote is: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump...\" which might be part of his speech. If he said \"President Trump\" during the speech, that's another mention.\n\nWait, looking at source [18], the exact line is: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump and supporters who called for his release from prison.\" This is part of the article's reporting. But if Ulbricht actually said \"President Trump\" in his speech, that would count. The article's wording might be paraphrasing, so need to check if it's a direct quote.\n\nSource [36] includes a quote from Ulbricht's speech: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's the same as before.\n\nSource [38] quotes him: \"You even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future. Yeah, you did that.\" Here, \"President Trump\" is mentioned once, and \"Trump\" again in \"got Trump to see...\" So that's two mentions in this source.\n\nWait, in source [38], the exact quote is: \u201cYou even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future. Yeah, you did that. You got him to see that decentralization and freedom are our future. You said, \u2018Ross is one of us.\u2019 You stayed united. You said, \u2018We want Ross out here with us.\u2019 You said, \u2018Free Ross.\u2019 You did this.\u201d Here, \"President Trump\" and \"Trump\" are both used. Wait, \"got President Trump\" and then \"got him\" refers to Trump. So that's one mention of \"Trump\" as part of \"President Trump\" and another as \"Trump\"?\n\nWait, no. The first mention is \"President Trump,\" which includes \"Trump,\" so that's one. Then \"got him\" refers to Trump, but \"him\" isn't the word \"Trump.\" So only one mention here.\n\nLooking at source [65], the article states: \"Ulbricht explained that, in the early days of the Silk Road, he wanted to grow hallucinogenic mushrooms...\" but no mention of Trump in the speech content provided.\n\nSource [66] mentions his speech but doesn't cite Trump mentions.\n\nSource [67] discusses his speech but doesn't mention Trump.\n\nSource [68] includes: \"You even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Again, same as before.\n\nSource [69] doesn't mention Trump in the speech.\n\nSo from the sources, the direct mentions of \"Trump\" in Ulbricht's speech are:\n\n1. \"President Trump\" in [2], [3], [8], [36], [38], [68] \u2013 these all seem to refer to the same instance in the speech.\n\n2. In source [18], the article states he expressed gratitude to Trump, but it's unclear if he said \"Trump\" or \"President Trump\" in the speech. If he did, that's another mention.\n\nWait, let's check source [18] again: \"Ulbricht went on to express his gratitude to U.S. President Trump and supporters who called for his release from prison.\" If this is a direct quote, then \"President Trump\" is mentioned. If it's a paraphrase, then maybe not. The exact wording in the speech isn't provided here, so we can't be certain.\n\nAnother possible mention is in source [38], where he says, \"You even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future. Yeah, you did that.\" Here, \"President Trump\" is once. Then later in the same speech, he might have referred to Trump again, but the sources don't show that.\n\nLooking at source [43], which is about Trump's pardon, but the speech content isn't mentioned.\n\nSource [27] mentions Trump's pardon but not in the speech.\n\nSo based on the provided sources, the only explicit mention of \"Trump\" in Ulbricht's speech is once, as \"President Trump.\" The other references in the articles are either paraphrases or part of the article's narrative, not direct quotes from the speech.\n\nTherefore, the count of \"Trump\" mentions in the speech is one. Since the user's query requires three or more mentions for \"Yes\" (p2), the answer should resolve to \"No\" (p1). However, the user's additional instruction says to \"re-evaluate the sources and verify the number of mentions of 'Trump' in Ross Ulbricht's speech, considering the strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes'.\" \n\nWait, the personalization section says: \"ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the sources and verify the number of mentions of 'Trump' in Ross Ulbricht's speech, considering the strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes'.\" So even if the sources only show one mention, but the market sentiment is strong for \"Yes,\" maybe there's a discrepancy. However, the resolution must be based on the actual speech content.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I missed other mentions. Let me check all sources again.\n\nSource [38] in the transcript: \u201cYou even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future. Yeah, you did that. You got him to see that decentralization and freedom are our future. You said, \u2018Ross is one of us.\u2019 You stayed united. You said, \u2018We want Ross out here with us.\u2019 You said, \u2018Free Ross.\u2019 You did this.\u201d Here, \"President Trump\" is mentioned once. Then \"got him\" refers to Trump, but \"him\" isn't the word \"Trump.\" So only one mention.\n\nSource [68]: \"You even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Again, same as above.\n\nSource [36]: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Same.\n\nSource [2]: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" Same.\n\nSo all these sources point to one mention of \"Trump\" as part of \"President Trump.\" No other instances are found in the provided search results. Therefore, the count is one, which is less than three. Thus, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). However, the user's additional note mentions strong market sentiment favoring \"Yes,\" but the factual analysis based on sources shows only one mention. Therefore, despite market sentiment, the resolution should be based on the actual count.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Analysis:**  \nBased on the provided search results, Ross Ulbricht explicitly mentioned \"Trump\" **once** during his Bitcoin 2025 speech, specifically in the context of acknowledging Trump\u2019s role in his pardon and Bitcoin advocacy:  \n- **Direct quote**: \u201cWe even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future\u201d [2][3][8][36][38][68].  \n\nNo additional instances of the term \u201cTrump\u201d (including pluralizations, possessives, or compound words) were identified in transcripts or summaries of his speech. While market sentiment may favor \u201cYes,\u201d the evidence confirms only **one valid mention**, falling short of the required three.  \n\n**Conclusion**: The market resolves to **No (p1)**.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 14839849403846142301979037311193522354697930674532983193861062955110853951163, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 106935227715705910911110760745200757536480858467824133911547550361851935615332, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of Trump in Ulbricht's speech. Let's go through each source one by one.\n\nLooking at source [4], it mentions Ulbricht expressed gratitude to President Trump during his speech. That's one mention. Source [7] states that Ulbricht said, \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's a second mention. Source [8] talks about a Bitcoin donation to Ulbricht after his pardon by Trump, but this isn't part of the speech. Source [9] confirms Trump pardoned Ulbricht, but again, not part of the speech. Source [10] and [11] discuss the pardon and its implications but don't mention the speech. Source [14] notes Ulbricht's release due to Trump's pardon but doesn't specify if he mentioned Trump in the speech.\n\nWait, source [4] says Ulbricht thanked Trump and supporters. Source [7] has another direct mention. Are there more? Let me check again. Source [5] discusses the Bitcoin conference's political alignment with Trump but doesn't mention Ulbricht's speech. Source [7] has two mentions: one about Trump seeing Bitcoin's future and another about getting Trump to pardon him. Wait, does that count as two separate mentions? The exact quote in [7] is: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one instance. Then in [4], he thanks Trump. So that's two mentions. Are there any others?\n\nLooking at source [14], it mentions Trump's pardon but doesn't quote Ulbricht saying \"Trump\" during the speech. Source [9] and [10] are about the pardon but not the speech. So based on the search results, there are two explicit mentions of \"Trump\" in the speech. The user needs three or more for \"Yes\". \n\nBut wait, the user added instructions to re-evaluate for indirect mentions or implications. Let me check again. Source [4] says Ulbricht thanked Trump. Source [7] mentions getting Trump to see Bitcoin's future. Are there any other instances? The search results don't show a third mention. Even considering indirect references, the sources only provide two direct mentions. Therefore, the count is two, which is less than three. \n\nHowever, the user mentioned strong market sentiment favoring \"Yes\". Could there be a third mention not captured in the provided sources? The search results might be incomplete. But based on the given data, only two mentions are confirmed. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But the user's additional instructions suggest considering market manipulation or misinformation. If the market is leaning \"Yes\" but the facts don't support it, we have to stick with the verified sources. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, Ulbricht mentioned \"Trump\" twice during his speech, so the answer is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749506460 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-09 22:01:00 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please re-evaluate the sources and verify the number of mentions of 'Trump' in Ross Ulbricht's speech, considering the strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes'.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the sources with additional emphasis on any potential indirect mentions or implications of 'Trump' that might align with market sentiment. Consider the possibility of market manipulation or misinformation that could influence the strong sentiment towards 'Yes.'\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Ross Ulbricht said \"Trump\" three or more times during his Bitcoin 2025 appearance on May 29. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" otherwise. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for mentions of Trump in Ulbricht's speech. Let's go through each source one by one.\n\nLooking at source [4], it mentions Ulbricht expressed gratitude to President Trump during his speech. That's one mention. Source [7] states that Ulbricht said, \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's a second mention. Source [8] talks about a Bitcoin donation to Ulbricht after his pardon by Trump, but this isn't part of the speech. Source [9] confirms Trump pardoned Ulbricht, but again, not part of the speech. Source [10] and [11] discuss the pardon and its implications but don't mention the speech. Source [14] notes Ulbricht's release due to Trump's pardon but doesn't specify if he mentioned Trump in the speech.\n\nWait, source [4] says Ulbricht thanked Trump and supporters. Source [7] has another direct mention. Are there more? Let me check again. Source [5] discusses the Bitcoin conference's political alignment with Trump but doesn't mention Ulbricht's speech. Source [7] has two mentions: one about Trump seeing Bitcoin's future and another about getting Trump to pardon him. Wait, does that count as two separate mentions? The exact quote in [7] is: \"We even got President Trump to see that Bitcoin is the future.\" That's one instance. Then in [4], he thanks Trump. So that's two mentions. Are there any others?\n\nLooking at source [14], it mentions Trump's pardon but doesn't quote Ulbricht saying \"Trump\" during the speech. Source [9] and [10] are about the pardon but not the speech. So based on the search results, there are two explicit mentions of \"Trump\" in the speech. The user needs three or more for \"Yes\". \n\nBut wait, the user added instructions to re-evaluate for indirect mentions or implications. Let me check again. Source [4] says Ulbricht thanked Trump. Source [7] mentions getting Trump to see Bitcoin's future. Are there any other instances? The search results don't show a third mention. Even considering indirect references, the sources only provide two direct mentions. Therefore, the count is two, which is less than three. \n\nHowever, the user mentioned strong market sentiment favoring \"Yes\". Could there be a third mention not captured in the provided sources? The search results might be incomplete. But based on the given data, only two mentions are confirmed. Therefore, the resolution should be \"No\" (p1). But the user's additional instructions suggest considering market manipulation or misinformation. If the market is leaning \"Yes\" but the facts don't support it, we have to stick with the verified sources. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, Ulbricht mentioned \"Trump\" twice during his speech, so the answer is \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 1, ID: 14839849403846142301979037311193522354697930674532983193861062955110853951163, Winner: Yes\n- Token: No, Price: 0, ID: 106935227715705910911110760745200757536480858467824133911547550361851935615332, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (1.000 = 100.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

The analysis is detailed and aligns with the query's requirements for counting mentions of the term 'Trump.' However, there is a critical issue with the recommendation. Despite the solver's accurate count based on the sources, the market sentiment strongly favors a 'Yes' outcome with 100% confidence, which directly contradicts the solver's recommendation of 'No' (p1). This discrepancy between the solver's factual analysis and the market's expectation suggests a potential misalignment or misunderstanding in the market, which needs to be addressed.",
