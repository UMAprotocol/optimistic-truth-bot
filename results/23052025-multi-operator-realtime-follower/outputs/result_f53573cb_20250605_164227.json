Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements or social media posts don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally said \"Apple\" during that timeframe. The current date is June 5, 2025, so the period in question is from last week up to tomorrow. \n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Search Result [1]**: Talks about Trump's June 2025 schedule, including events like the G7 Summit and NATO meetings. No mention of \"Apple\" here.\n\n2. **Search Result [2]**: Details the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary parade. No mention of \"Apple.\"\n\n3. **Search Result [3]**: Lists various events related to Trump, but they're all scheduled for June 14, 24, 26, etc., which are after the query's end date. So, irrelevant.\n\n4. **Search Result [4]**: A law enforcement event on May 19, 2025. That's before the start date of May 31, so it's outside the window.\n\n5. **Search Result [5]**: A Trump rally on June 18, 2025, which is after the period. Not relevant.\n\n6. **Search Result [6]**: A press conference on May 12, 2025, again before the timeframe.\n\n7. **Search Result [7]**: Phone call with Xi Jinping on June 5, 2025. The transcript mentions trade talks and tariffs but no reference to \"Apple.\"\n\n8. **Search Result [8]**: Presidential actions, including proclamations and executive orders. None mention \"Apple.\"\n\n9. **Search Result [9]**: Live events, including a bilateral meeting with Germany's Chancellor. No mention of \"Apple.\"\n\n10. **Search Result [10]**: Gaggle on Air Force One on May 16, 2025, which is before the period.\n\n11. **Search Result [11]**: Press briefings in May, outside the timeframe.\n\n12. **Search Result [12]**: Transcript of Trump's Summer Soir\u00e9e speech on June 4, 2025. He talks about various topics but doesn't say \"Apple.\"\n\n13. **Search Result [13]**: Another account of the Summer Soir\u00e9e. No mention of \"Apple.\"\n\n14. **Search Result [14]**: Travel ban announcement on June 4, 2025. The speech transcript doesn't include \"Apple.\"\n\n15. **Search Result [15]**: Memorial Day speech on May 26, 2025. Before the period, so irrelevant.\n\n16. **Search Result [16]**: Memorial Day remarks on May 26, 2025. Again, before the timeframe.\n\n17. **Search Result [17]**: Memorial Day event summary. No mention of \"Apple.\"\n\n18. **Search Result [18]**: Gaggle on May 30, 2025. The date is within the period (May 31 to June 6). Let me check the details. The gaggle happened on May 30, which is before the start date of May 31. So, it's outside the window.\n\nAfter reviewing all sources, there's no instance where Trump verbally mentioned \"Apple\" during the specified timeframe. All events within the period (June 1-5) don't have any references to \"Apple.\" The next step is to check if there are any other events between now and June 6, but according to the schedule, the next events are the G7 Summit starting June 15 and others later in June. Since the user's deadline is June 6, and there are no recorded verbal mentions in the provided sources, the answer should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to know if Donald Trump will mention the word \"Apple\" between May 31, 11:20 AM ET and June 6, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements or social media posts don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally said \"Apple\" during that timeframe. The current date is June 5, 2025, so the period in question is from last week up to tomorrow. \n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n1. **Search Result [1]**: Talks about Trump's June 2025 schedule, including events like the G7 Summit and NATO meetings. No mention of \"Apple\" here.\n\n2. **Search Result [2]**: Details the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary parade. No mention of \"Apple.\"\n\n3. **Search Result [3]**: Lists various events related to Trump, but they're all scheduled for June 14, 24, 26, etc., which are after the query's end date. So, irrelevant.\n\n4. **Search Result [4]**: A law enforcement event on May 19, 2025. That's before the start date of May 31, so it's outside the window.\n\n5. **Search Result [5]**: A Trump rally on June 18, 2025, which is after the period. Not relevant.\n\n6. **Search Result [6]**: A press conference on May 12, 2025, again before the timeframe.\n\n7. **Search Result [7]**: Phone call with Xi Jinping on June 5, 2025. The transcript mentions trade talks and tariffs but no reference to \"Apple.\"\n\n8. **Search Result [8]**: Presidential actions, including proclamations and executive orders. None mention \"Apple.\"\n\n9. **Search Result [9]**: Live events, including a bilateral meeting with Germany's Chancellor. No mention of \"Apple.\"\n\n10. **Search Result [10]**: Gaggle on Air Force One on May 16, 2025, which is before the period.\n\n11. **Search Result [11]**: Press briefings in May, outside the timeframe.\n\n12. **Search Result [12]**: Transcript of Trump's Summer Soir\u00e9e speech on June 4, 2025. He talks about various topics but doesn't say \"Apple.\"\n\n13. **Search Result [13]**: Another account of the Summer Soir\u00e9e. No mention of \"Apple.\"\n\n14. **Search Result [14]**: Travel ban announcement on June 4, 2025. The speech transcript doesn't include \"Apple.\"\n\n15. **Search Result [15]**: Memorial Day speech on May 26, 2025. Before the period, so irrelevant.\n\n16. **Search Result [16]**: Memorial Day remarks on May 26, 2025. Again, before the timeframe.\n\n17. **Search Result [17]**: Memorial Day event summary. No mention of \"Apple.\"\n\n18. **Search Result [18]**: Gaggle on May 30, 2025. The date is within the period (May 31 to June 6). Let me check the details. The gaggle happened on May 30, which is before the start date of May 31. So, it's outside the window.\n\nAfter reviewing all sources, there's no instance where Trump verbally mentioned \"Apple\" during the specified timeframe. All events within the period (June 1-5) don't have any references to \"Apple.\" The next step is to check if there are any other events between now and June 6, but according to the schedule, the next events are the G7 Summit starting June 15 and others later in June. Since the user's deadline is June 6, and there are no recorded verbal mentions in the provided sources, the answer should resolve to \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 14536665459580432590621051358165496512191331665793520396556083028880145952253, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 58898037717225884008399835365656105727219272867990056027761583738352984928082, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements or social media posts don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally said \"Apple\" during that timeframe. The current date is June 5, 2025, so the period in question is from May 31 to June 6. However, since today is June 5, the data might not cover up to June 6 yet, but the user might have access to future information.\n\nLooking through the search results, most of the recent mentions of Apple are from May 23 and May 24, 2025, where Trump threatened tariffs on Apple if they don't manufacture iPhones in the US. For example, sources [8], [15], [22], [23], [31], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [52], [53], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64] all discuss Trump's comments about Apple and tariffs. However, these are all from May, which is before the May 31 start date of the query's timeframe.\n\nThe latest relevant source is [7], the Department of State Press Briefing on June 3, 2025. However, this briefing is by spokesperson Tammy Bruce, not Trump himself. There's no indication Trump spoke about Apple here.\n\nAnother source is [29], a White House proclamation from June 3, 2025, about adjusting imports of aluminum and steel. The proclamation doesn't mention Apple.\n\nSource [37] is a transcript from June 5, 2025, but it's a news segment discussing Trump's policies, not a direct statement from him.\n\nSource [55] is a YouTube video from May 23, 2025, where Trump discusses tariffs on Apple, but again, this is outside the timeframe.\n\nThere's also [38], a video from June 5, 2025, but it's an interview with John Dickerson from 2016, so irrelevant.\n\nSource [40] is a video from June 5, 2025, but it's about a swearing-in ceremony, not mentioning Apple.\n\nSource [54] is a speech from 2020, so not relevant.\n\nLooking for any mentions in June 2025 within the timeframe, there's no evidence in the provided search results that Trump verbally mentioned \"Apple\" between May 31 and June 5. Since the query's end date is June 6, but the current data only goes up to June 5, it's possible there might be a mention on June 6 that's not included here. However, based on the available information up to June 5, there's no record of Trump saying \"Apple\" in the specified window.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation would be \"No\" (p1) unless there's a mention on June 6 that's not covered here. But given the data, it's safe to resolve as No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749140834 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 16:27:14 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the available data and market sentiment to ensure the recommendation aligns with the most probable outcome based on all available information.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump mentioned the word \"Apple\" between May 31, 11:20 AM ET and June 6, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The resolution depends on any verbal mention in a recorded and publicly accessible audio or video. Written statements or social media posts don't count. \n\nFirst, I need to check all the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally said \"Apple\" during that timeframe. The current date is June 5, 2025, so the period in question is from May 31 to June 6. However, since today is June 5, the data might not cover up to June 6 yet, but the user might have access to future information.\n\nLooking through the search results, most of the recent mentions of Apple are from May 23 and May 24, 2025, where Trump threatened tariffs on Apple if they don't manufacture iPhones in the US. For example, sources [8], [15], [22], [23], [31], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [52], [53], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64] all discuss Trump's comments about Apple and tariffs. However, these are all from May, which is before the May 31 start date of the query's timeframe.\n\nThe latest relevant source is [7], the Department of State Press Briefing on June 3, 2025. However, this briefing is by spokesperson Tammy Bruce, not Trump himself. There's no indication Trump spoke about Apple here.\n\nAnother source is [29], a White House proclamation from June 3, 2025, about adjusting imports of aluminum and steel. The proclamation doesn't mention Apple.\n\nSource [37] is a transcript from June 5, 2025, but it's a news segment discussing Trump's policies, not a direct statement from him.\n\nSource [55] is a YouTube video from May 23, 2025, where Trump discusses tariffs on Apple, but again, this is outside the timeframe.\n\nThere's also [38], a video from June 5, 2025, but it's an interview with John Dickerson from 2016, so irrelevant.\n\nSource [40] is a video from June 5, 2025, but it's about a swearing-in ceremony, not mentioning Apple.\n\nSource [54] is a speech from 2020, so not relevant.\n\nLooking for any mentions in June 2025 within the timeframe, there's no evidence in the provided search results that Trump verbally mentioned \"Apple\" between May 31 and June 5. Since the query's end date is June 6, but the current data only goes up to June 5, it's possible there might be a mention on June 6 that's not included here. However, based on the available information up to June 5, there's no record of Trump saying \"Apple\" in the specified window.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation would be \"No\" (p1) unless there's a mention on June 6 that's not covered here. But given the data, it's safe to resolve as No.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 14536665459580432590621051358165496512191331665793520396556083028880145952253, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 58898037717225884008399835365656105727219272867990056027761583738352984928082, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Trump mentioned \"Apple\" between May 31, 11:20 AM ET and June 6, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The key here is to check all the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally mentioned \"Apple\" within that timeframe.\n\nFirst, I'll note the time frame: May 31 to June 6, 2025. The current date given is June 5, 2025, so the market hasn't closed yet, but we need to check up to now.\n\nLooking through the search results, several sources mention Trump's statements about Apple. For example, on May 23, 2025, Trump threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones if not made in the U.S. (sources [6], [7], [10], [12], [23], [31], [41], [57]). However, May 23 is before the market's start date of May 31, so those don't count.\n\nNext, source [25] from June 5, 2025, mentions Trump's tariffs affecting Apple's AI rollout in China. But this is a written article, not a verbal mention by Trump. The user specified that written statements don't count.\n\nSource [42] is a video transcript from May 23, 2025, where Trump discusses Apple and tariffs. Again, this is before the market's timeframe.\n\nSource [43] is a video from May 23, 2025, where Trump answers questions about Apple. Still outside the date range.\n\nSource [48] is a video from May 23, 2025, discussing Trump's threats. Again, too early.\n\nSource [54] is a video from June 4, 2025, where Trump hosts a Summer Soir\u00e9e. The transcript doesn't mention Apple.\n\nSource [55] is another transcript from June 4, 2025, but no mention of Apple.\n\nSource [58] is a video from June 4, 2025, but the description doesn't indicate Trump mentioning Apple.\n\nSource [59] is a video from May 23, 2025, again outside the timeframe.\n\nLooking for any verbal mentions within the timeframe, the latest relevant source is [25], but it's a written article. There's no evidence in the provided search results of Trump verbally mentioning \"Apple\" between May 31 and June 5. Since the market closes on June 6, but as of June 5, there's no recorded verbal mention. However, the user's additional instructions mention re-evaluating with strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes' and checking for new sources. The search results don't include any new verbal mentions within the timeframe. Therefore, based on the provided data, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nBased on the provided search results, there is no verifiable evidence that Donald Trump **verbally** mentioned the term \"Apple\" between May 31, 2025 (11:20 AM ET) and June 6, 2025 (11:59 PM ET). Key findings:\n\n1. **Timeframe Analysis**:  \n   - The market\u2019s resolution window (May 31\u2013June 6, 2025) postdates nearly all available transcripts and videos in the search results. For example:  \n     - Trump\u2019s May 23, 2025 remarks about Apple tariffs ([6][7][10][12][23][31][57]) fall outside the resolution window.  \n     - The June 4, 2025 White House Summer Soir\u00e9e transcript ([54][55][58]) contains no mention of \"Apple.\"  \n\n2. **Verbal vs. Written Mentions**:  \n   - The market explicitly requires **verbal mentions** (audio/video). Written statements (e.g., Truth Social posts, articles) do not qualify.  \n   - While Trump\u2019s May 23, 2025 tariff threats dominated headlines, these occurred before the resolution period.  \n\n3. **No New Evidence**:  \n   - No search results indicate Trump verbally referenced \"Apple\" during the specified timeframe. Recent articles (e.g., [25][41]) discuss Apple\u2019s manufacturing shifts but do not cite new verbal statements by Trump.  \n\n**Conclusion**:  \nSince no qualifying verbal mention of \"Apple\" occurred within the resolution window, the market should resolve to **No (p1)**.",

The user wants to know if the market should resolve to \"Yes\" because Trump mentioned \"Apple\" between May 31, 11:20 AM ET and June 6, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. The key here is to check all the provided search results for any instances where Trump verbally mentioned \"Apple\" within that timeframe.\n\nFirst, I'll note the time frame: May 31 to June 6, 2025. The current date given is June 5, 2025, so the market hasn't closed yet, but we need to check up to now.\n\nLooking through the search results, several sources mention Trump's statements about Apple. For example, on May 23, 2025, Trump threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones if not made in the U.S. (sources [6], [7], [10], [12], [23], [31], [41], [57]). However, May 23 is before the market's start date of May 31, so those don't count.\n\nNext, source [25] from June 5, 2025, mentions Trump's tariffs affecting Apple's AI rollout in China. But this is a written article, not a verbal mention by Trump. The user specified that written statements don't count.\n\nSource [42] is a video transcript from May 23, 2025, where Trump discusses Apple and tariffs. Again, this is before the market's timeframe.\n\nSource [43] is a video from May 23, 2025, where Trump answers questions about Apple. Still outside the date range.\n\nSource [48] is a video from May 23, 2025, discussing Trump's threats. Again, too early.\n\nSource [54] is a video from June 4, 2025, where Trump hosts a Summer Soir\u00e9e. The transcript doesn't mention Apple.\n\nSource [55] is another transcript from June 4, 2025, but no mention of Apple.\n\nSource [58] is a video from June 4, 2025, but the description doesn't indicate Trump mentioning Apple.\n\nSource [59] is a video from May 23, 2025, again outside the timeframe.\n\nLooking for any verbal mentions within the timeframe, the latest relevant source is [25], but it's a written article. There's no evidence in the provided search results of Trump verbally mentioning \"Apple\" between May 31 and June 5. Since the market closes on June 6, but as of June 5, there's no recorded verbal mention. However, the user's additional instructions mention re-evaluating with strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes' and checking for new sources. The search results don't include any new verbal mentions within the timeframe. Therefore, based on the provided data, the resolution should be \"No\".\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\n**Explanation:**  \nBased on the provided search results, there is no verifiable evidence that Donald Trump **verbally** mentioned the term \"Apple\" between May 31, 2025 (11:20 AM ET) and June 6, 2025 (11:59 PM ET). Key findings:\n\n1. **Timeframe Analysis**:  \n   - The market\u2019s resolution window (May 31\u2013June 6, 2025) postdates nearly all available transcripts and videos in the search results. For example:  \n     - Trump\u2019s May 23, 2025 remarks about Apple tariffs ([6][7][10][12][23][31][57]) fall outside the resolution window.  \n     - The June 4, 2025 White House Summer Soir\u00e9e transcript ([54][55][58]) contains no mention of \"Apple.\"  \n\n2. **Verbal vs. Written Mentions**:  \n   - The market explicitly requires **verbal mentions** (audio/video). Written statements (e.g., Truth Social posts, articles) do not qualify.  \n   - While Trump\u2019s May 23, 2025 tariff threats dominated headlines, these occurred before the resolution period.  \n\n3. **No New Evidence**:  \n   - No search results indicate Trump verbally referenced \"Apple\" during the specified timeframe. Recent articles (e.g., [25][41]) discuss Apple\u2019s manufacturing shifts but do not cite new verbal statements by Trump.  \n\n**Conclusion**:  \nSince no qualifying verbal mention of \"Apple\" occurred within the resolution window, the market should resolve to **No (p1)**.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 14536665459580432590621051358165496512191331665793520396556083028880145952253, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 58898037717225884008399835365656105727219272867990056027761583738352984928082, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Let's go through each source one by one.\n\nLooking at the search results, most of them are transcripts of speeches, interviews, and events. The key here is to find mentions of \"Apple\" in the time frame specified. \n\nStarting with result [5], which is from May 23, 2025. Trump talks about tariffs on Apple, but this is before May 31, so it's outside the window. Result [11] is from May 23 as well, discussing the same tariff threat. Again, too early.\n\nResult [14] is a video from May 23, 2025, where Trump signs executive orders and discusses Apple and tariffs. Still before the timeframe. Result [15] is a press conference on May 30, 2025. The transcript doesn't mention Apple. \n\nResult [12] is a speech on June 4, 2025. The transcript provided doesn't include the word \"Apple.\" Result [17] and [18] are about the travel ban and don't mention Apple. \n\nResult [7] is a speech to Congress on March 5, 2025, which is way before the period. Results [3], [6], [9], [10], [13], [16] are all outside the date range or don't mention Apple.\n\nThe critical point is that all mentions of Apple in the provided sources are from May 23, 2025, which is before the start date of May 31. There's no evidence in the search results of Trump mentioning \"Apple\" within the specified timeframe. \n\nTherefore, based on the available data, the answer should resolve to \"No,\" which corresponds to p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 14536665459580432590621051358165496512191331665793520396556083028880145952253, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 58898037717225884008399835365656105727219272867990056027761583738352984928082, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The next scheduled event is the G7 Summit starting June 15, which is outside the window.\n\nTherefore, the recommendation is \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.995, ID: 14536665459580432590621051358165496512191331665793520396556083028880145952253, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.005, ID: 58898037717225884008399835365656105727219272867990056027761583738352984928082, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors YES outcome (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Will Trump say \"Apple\" this week?, description: This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump mentions the listed term between May 31, 11:20 AM ET and June 6, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPluralization/possessive of the word will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nA \u00e2\u0080\u0098mention' will include any verbal mention which is recorded (audio or video) and publicly accessible.\n\nWritten usages of terms (e.g. Truth Social posts, written statements, etc.) will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nVideos posted on his social media which were filmed outside this market's time frame will not qualify for a \"Yes\" resolution. market_id: 548521\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe perplexity solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: perplexity\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749140834 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 16:27:14 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Re-evaluate the query with a focus on uncovering any potential upcoming events or insider information that might explain the strong market sentiment favoring 'Yes'. Consider any new sources or updates that might have emerged."
