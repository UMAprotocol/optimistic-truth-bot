Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Available Data Sources Information:\n   ALL AVAILABLE API CONFIGURATIONS:\n   - Binance (Category: crypto):\n     * API Key: BINANCE_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy endpoint: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n   - Sports Data IO - MLB (Category: sports, Subcategory: baseball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb\n   - Sports Data IO - NBA (Category: sports, Subcategory: basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NBA_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nba\n   - Sports Data IO - NFL (Category: sports, Subcategory: football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NFL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl\n   - Sports Data IO - NHL (Category: sports, Subcategory: hockey):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_NHL_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nhl\n   - Sports Data IO - CFB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college football):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CFB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cfb\n   - Sports Data IO - CBB (Category: sports, Subcategory: college basketball):\n     * API Key: SPORTS_DATA_IO_CBB_API_KEY\n     * primary endpoint: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/cbb\n\n5. Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 1 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551812\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749880849 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 06:00:49 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# API keys loaded from environment variables\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configure logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nconsole_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\nconsole_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nconsole_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\nlogger.addHandler(console_handler)\n\ndef get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches data from Binance API with a fallback to a proxy endpoint if the primary fails.\n    \"\"\"\n    proxy_url = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\"\n    primary_url = \"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines\"\n\n    try:\n        # First try the proxy endpoint\n        response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1h&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data[0]\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.warning(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n        # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n        response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1h&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        data = response.json()\n        if data:\n            return data[0]\n\ndef resolve_market():\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolves the market based on the change in BTC/USDT price from Binance.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbol = \"BTCUSDT\"\n    target_time = datetime(2025, 6, 14, 1, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\"))\n    target_time_utc = target_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n    start_time_ms = int(target_time_utc.timestamp() * 1000)\n    end_time_ms = start_time_ms + 3600000  # 1 hour later\n\n    try:\n        data = get_data(symbol, start_time_ms, end_time_ms)\n        if data:\n            open_price = float(data[1])\n            close_price = float(data[4])\n            change_percentage = ((close_price - open_price) / open_price) * 100\n\n            if change_percentage >= 0:\n                print(\"recommendation: p2\")  # Up\n            else:\n                print(\"recommendation: p1\")  # Down\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to fetch or process data: {e}\")\n        print(\"recommendation: p3\")  # Unknown/50-50 if error occurs\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    resolve_market()\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p2\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Query Type Specific Information:\n\n   Cryptocurrency Data Sources:\n   - Binance:\n     * primary: https://api.binance.com/api/v3\n     * proxy: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy\n     * RECOMMENDED: Use this proxy endpoint first for better reliability\n     * Example: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/binance-proxy?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime=TIMESTAMP&endTime=TIMESTAMP\n\n     * CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Since a proxy endpoint is provided, you MUST implement a fallback mechanism:\n       1. Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551812\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749880849 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 06:00:49 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

Recommendation found: p1.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p1\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.005, ID: 99152294815466357212642094545225856354849875918174929688149622303901419656319, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.995, ID: 79567047675905517813650481465746127436562718175642571091524863469423923318307, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Try the proxy endpoint first (better reliability)\n       2. If proxy fails (timeout, error response, etc.), automatically fall back to the primary endpoint\n       3. Your code MUST handle this gracefully with try/except blocks\n\n     Example fallback code structure:\n     ```python\n     def get_data(symbol, start_time, end_time):\n         try:\n             # First try the proxy endpoint\n             response = requests.get(f\"{proxy_url}?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n         except Exception as e:\n             print(f\"Proxy endpoint failed: {str(e)}, falling back to primary endpoint\")\n             # Fall back to primary endpoint if proxy fails\n             response = requests.get(f\"{primary_url}/klines?symbol={symbol}&interval=1m&limit=1&startTime={start_time}&endTime={end_time}\", timeout=10)\n             response.raise_for_status()\n             return response.json()\n     ```\n     \n6. NEVER include actual API key values in the code, always load them from environment variables.\n\n7. IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATA SOURCES: If a proxy endpoint is provided alongside a primary endpoint, you MUST implement the fallback mechanism described above. This is critical for reliability:\n   - Always try the proxy endpoint first\n   - If the proxy fails, fall back to the primary endpoint\n   - Use appropriate timeout values (10 seconds recommended)\n   - Include proper error handling with try/except blocks\n\nThe code should be completely self-contained and runnable with no arguments.\n\n\nHere's a complete code example that shows how to solve this type of problem:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\nimport pytz\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport os\n\n# Load environment variables from .env file\nload_dotenv()\n\n# Note: Binance public API doesn't require an API key for basic price queries\n# However, if we need rate limits increased or private endpoints, we would use these:\nBINANCE_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_KEY\")\nBINANCE_API_SECRET = os.getenv(\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\")\n\n# Sensitive data patterns to mask in logs\nSENSITIVE_PATTERNS = [\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_KEY\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"BINANCE_API_SECRET\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"api_secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"key\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    re.compile(r\"secret\\s*=\\s*['\\\"]?[\\w-]+['\\\"]?\", re.IGNORECASE),\n    #

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 14, 1 AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTC/USDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTC/USDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTC/USDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 551812\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749880849 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 06:00:49 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please verify the accuracy of the data fetched and the alignment of timestamps used in the code.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price (BTC/USDT) on Binance will be up or down for the 1-hour candle starting June 14, 1 AM ET. The resolution depends on the percentage change shown on Binance's 1H candle once it's finalized. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current time. The current timestamp is June 14, 2025, 6:00:49 AM UTC. The event in question is for June 14, 1 AM ET, which is 5 AM UTC. Since the current time is past that, the event has already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's data from CoinGecko (source [5]) showing the closing price on June 13 as $106,046 and June 14 as N/A. However, other sources like TradingView (source [12], [16]) and Coinalyze (source [9], [32]) mention recent price movements. For example, on June 13, Bitcoin's price dropped to around $102,700 but rebounded to $104,000. The 1-hour candle at 1 AM ET (5 AM UTC) would have closed by 6 AM UTC. \n\nThe key is to find the specific 1-hour window. The Binance API (sources [3], [7], [17]) provides candlestick data. The 1H candle starting at 5 AM UTC would close at 6 AM UTC. The current time is 6:00:49 AM UTC, so the data should be available. \n\nSearch result [5] from CoinGecko shows the price on June 14 as N/A, but other sources like [28] (Coingape) list the price on June 13 as $105,314 and June 14 as $114,296.98, which seems inconsistent. However, considering the volatility and recent news (source [6], [9], [32]) about market drops due to geopolitical tensions, the price might have fluctuated. \n\nThe critical point is the percentage change in the 1H candle. If the closing price is higher than the opening, it's up (p2). If lower, down (p1). Given the timestamp and available data, the 1H candle from 5 AM to 6 AM UTC likely closed with a positive change, considering the rebound mentioned in sources. However, some sources indicate a drop, so I need to cross-verify. \n\nSource [13] mentions a 4H analysis with support at $57,800, but that's outdated. Source [15] predicts a rise to $114,296.98 on June 14, suggesting an upward trend. However, real-time data from Binance (source [33]) shows the current price around $105,409.6, indicating possible volatility. \n\nSince the event time has passed, and assuming Binance's data is accurate, the resolution should be based on the actual 1H candle change. If the closing price is higher than the opening, resolve to p2 (Up). If not, p1 (Down). Given the mixed signals but considering the rebound after a drop, it's possible the change was positive. However, without explicit data from Binance's 1H candle at that exact time, I need to rely on the latest available info. \n\nWait, the user provided a URL for Binance's BTC/USDT pair. Checking source [33], the Binance Futures page shows the current price, but historical 1H candles aren't directly listed. However, source [5] from June 14 shows a closing price, but it's N/A. Other sources like [28] have conflicting data. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering the market's tendency to rebound after drops, and the fact that the event time has passed, the most probable outcome is that the 1H candle had a positive change, resolving to p2 (Up). However, if the data shows a negative change, it's p1. Since the exact data isn't explicitly found in the provided sources, but the ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no info is available, I'll go with the probable outcome based on recent trends. \n\nWait, the current time is 6 AM UTC, and the candle closed at 6 AM. The user's query is about the 1 AM ET (5 AM UTC) candle, which would have closed at 6 AM UTC. The data should be available. However, in the provided sources, the latest data is from June 14, 6:00 AM UTC, but the closing price isn't explicitly stated. \n\nLooking at source [5], the June 14 entry has a closing price of N/A, but June 13 is $106,046. If the price on June 14 opened higher than the previous close, and the 1H candle from 5-6 AM UTC shows an increase, then it's up. However, without the exact open and close prices for that specific hour, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instruction to resolve based on Binance's data and assuming the event has occurred, but the provided sources don't have the exact 1H candle data, I might have to default to p3 (unknown). However, the ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nConsidering the market's movement around that time (source [9], [32] mention a drop to $102k and rebound to $104k), the 1H candle might have a positive change if the rebound happened within that hour. Alternatively, if the drop continued, it's negative. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present, but the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily, and the Binance URL (source [33]) doesn't show historical candles, but the ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome, I'll have to make an educated guess. If the price after the event time is higher than before, it's up. \n\nGiven the current price on June 14 is around $105k (source [5], [28]), and the previous close was $106k, if the 1H candle opened at $106k and closed at $105k, it's down. But if it opened lower and closed higher, it's up. Without exact data, but considering the market's volatility and possible recovery, I'll assume the change was positive, resolving to p2 (Up).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

The user wants to know if Bitcoin's price (BTC/USDT) on Binance will be up or down for the 1-hour candle starting June 14, 1 AM ET. The resolution depends on the percentage change shown on Binance's 1H candle once it's finalized. \n\nFirst, I need to check the current time. The current timestamp is June 14, 2025, 6:00:49 AM UTC. The event in question is for June 14, 1 AM ET, which is 5 AM UTC. Since the current time is past that, the event has already occurred. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's data from CoinGecko (source [5]) showing the closing price on June 13 as $106,046 and June 14 as N/A. However, other sources like TradingView (source [12], [16]) and Coinalyze (source [9], [32]) mention recent price movements. For example, on June 13, Bitcoin's price dropped to around $102,700 but rebounded to $104,000. The 1-hour candle at 1 AM ET (5 AM UTC) would have closed by 6 AM UTC. \n\nThe key is to find the specific 1-hour window. The Binance API (sources [3], [7], [17]) provides candlestick data. The 1H candle starting at 5 AM UTC would close at 6 AM UTC. The current time is 6:00:49 AM UTC, so the data should be available. \n\nSearch result [5] from CoinGecko shows the price on June 14 as N/A, but other sources like [28] (Coingape) list the price on June 13 as $105,314 and June 14 as $114,296.98, which seems inconsistent. However, considering the volatility and recent news (source [6], [9], [32]) about market drops due to geopolitical tensions, the price might have fluctuated. \n\nThe critical point is the percentage change in the 1H candle. If the closing price is higher than the opening, it's up (p2). If lower, down (p1). Given the timestamp and available data, the 1H candle from 5 AM to 6 AM UTC likely closed with a positive change, considering the rebound mentioned in sources. However, some sources indicate a drop, so I need to cross-verify. \n\nSource [13] mentions a 4H analysis with support at $57,800, but that's outdated. Source [15] predicts a rise to $114,296.98 on June 14, suggesting an upward trend. However, real-time data from Binance (source [33]) shows the current price around $105,409.6, indicating possible volatility. \n\nSince the event time has passed, and assuming Binance's data is accurate, the resolution should be based on the actual 1H candle change. If the closing price is higher than the opening, resolve to p2 (Up). If not, p1 (Down). Given the mixed signals but considering the rebound after a drop, it's possible the change was positive. However, without explicit data from Binance's 1H candle at that exact time, I need to rely on the latest available info. \n\nWait, the user provided a URL for Binance's BTC/USDT pair. Checking source [33], the Binance Futures page shows the current price, but historical 1H candles aren't directly listed. However, source [5] from June 14 shows a closing price, but it's N/A. Other sources like [28] have conflicting data. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering the market's tendency to rebound after drops, and the fact that the event time has passed, the most probable outcome is that the 1H candle had a positive change, resolving to p2 (Up). However, if the data shows a negative change, it's p1. Since the exact data isn't explicitly found in the provided sources, but the ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome if the event date is past and no info is available, I'll go with the probable outcome based on recent trends. \n\nWait, the current time is 6 AM UTC, and the candle closed at 6 AM. The user's query is about the 1 AM ET (5 AM UTC) candle, which would have closed at 6 AM UTC. The data should be available. However, in the provided sources, the latest data is from June 14, 6:00 AM UTC, but the closing price isn't explicitly stated. \n\nLooking at source [5], the June 14 entry has a closing price of N/A, but June 13 is $106,046. If the price on June 14 opened higher than the previous close, and the 1H candle from 5-6 AM UTC shows an increase, then it's up. However, without the exact open and close prices for that specific hour, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the user's instruction to resolve based on Binance's data and assuming the event has occurred, but the provided sources don't have the exact 1H candle data, I might have to default to p3 (unknown). However, the ancillary data says if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nConsidering the market's movement around that time (source [9], [32] mention a drop to $102k and rebound to $104k), the 1H candle might have a positive change if the rebound happened within that hour. Alternatively, if the drop continued, it's negative. \n\nSince the exact data isn't present, but the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs heavily, and the Binance URL (source [33]) doesn't show historical candles, but the ancillary data says to assume the most probable outcome, I'll have to make an educated guess. If the price after the event time is higher than before, it's up. \n\nGiven the current price on June 14 is around $105k (source [5], [28]), and the previous close was $106k, if the 1H candle opened at $106k and closed at $105k, it's down. But if it opened lower and closed higher, it's up. Without exact data, but considering the market's volatility and possible recovery, I'll assume the change was positive, resolving to p2 (Up).\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.005, ID: 99152294815466357212642094545225856354849875918174929688149622303901419656319, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.995, ID: 79567047675905517813650481465746127436562718175642571091524863469423923318307, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT price on Binance had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0 for the 1-hour candle starting June 14 at 1 AM ET. The current timestamp is June 14, 2025, 6:00:49 AM UTC, which is 2:00 AM ET. So the candle in question would have started at 1 AM ET (5 AM UTC) and ended at 2 AM ET (6 AM UTC). Since the current time is 6 AM UTC, the candle has closed, and the data should be available.\n\nFirst, I need to check the Binance data for that specific 1-hour candle. The user provided several search results, including real-time data from sources like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and Binance itself. Looking at result [6], CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate as 105,333.63 USDT as of 05:09:59 AM UTC. However, this is just a snapshot, not the specific 1-hour window.\n\nResult [4] from Binance's converter shows the current BTC/USDT rate at 105,321.3 USDT as of June 14, 2025, 05:07 AM. But again, this is a real-time rate, not the specific candle.\n\nResult [17] from TradingView mentions the previous close and day's range, but the exact 1-hour candle data isn't specified. Similarly, result [3] discusses futures contracts but doesn't provide the exact percentage change for the 1-hour window.\n\nThe key here is to find the opening and closing prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 1 AM ET (5 AM UTC). The change percentage is calculated as ((Close - Open)/Open)*100. If this value is >=0, the market resolves to Up (p2); otherwise, Down (p1).\n\nLooking at the historical data in result [16], the dataset includes 4-hour intervals up to January 2025, but the specific 1-hour data for June 14 isn't covered. Result [13] provides minute-level data up to the present, but without access to the actual CSV, I can't extract the exact numbers.\n\nResult [6] from CoinMarketCap has a table showing the BTC/USDT rates for each day, including June 14 at 105,331.56 USDT. However, this is daily data, not hourly. The 24-hour change is mentioned as 0.87%, but that's over a full day, not the specific 1-hour window.\n\nResult [2] from CentralCharts provides a technical analysis on a 1-hour timeframe as of May 14, 2025, which is outdated. Result [15] from Binance Futures shows the 24-hour high and low but not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nSince the exact open and close prices for the 1-hour candle aren't directly available in the provided search results, I need to infer based on the available data. The current price around 6 AM UTC is approximately 105,321 USDT. If the price at the start of the candle (5 AM UTC) was lower than this, the change would be positive. However, without the exact open price, it's challenging to determine definitively.\n\nGiven the user's previous response was p2 (Up) and they're asking to check again, perhaps the initial assumption was based on the overall positive trend. However, without concrete data for that specific hour, the resolution should default to p4 if information is insufficient. But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Up if the change is >=0. \n\nConsidering the market's reliance on Binance's data and the lack of conflicting information, if the price at 6 AM UTC is around the same or higher than at 5 AM, the change would be non-negative. Since the current price is stable around 105k, and assuming no major drop occurred in that hour, the most probable outcome is Up (p2). However, without explicit data, there's uncertainty. But the user's guidelines state to resolve based on probable outcome if the event has passed. Hence, p2 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749880849 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 06:00:49 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT price on Binance had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0 for the 1-hour candle starting June 14 at 1 AM ET. The current timestamp is June 14, 2025, 6:00:49 AM UTC, which is 2:00 AM ET. So the candle in question would have started at 1 AM ET (5 AM UTC) and ended at 2 AM ET (6 AM UTC). Since the current time is 6 AM UTC, the candle has closed, and the data should be available.\n\nFirst, I need to check the Binance data for that specific 1-hour candle. The user provided several search results, including real-time data from sources like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and Binance itself. Looking at result [6], CoinMarketCap shows the BTC/USDT rate as 105,333.63 USDT as of 05:09:59 AM UTC. However, this is just a snapshot, not the specific 1-hour window.\n\nResult [4] from Binance's converter shows the current BTC/USDT rate at 105,321.3 USDT as of June 14, 2025, 05:07 AM. But again, this is a real-time rate, not the specific candle.\n\nResult [17] from TradingView mentions the previous close and day's range, but the exact 1-hour candle data isn't specified. Similarly, result [3] discusses futures contracts but doesn't provide the exact percentage change for the 1-hour window.\n\nThe key here is to find the opening and closing prices for the 1-hour candle starting at 1 AM ET (5 AM UTC). The change percentage is calculated as ((Close - Open)/Open)*100. If this value is >=0, the market resolves to Up (p2); otherwise, Down (p1).\n\nLooking at the historical data in result [16], the dataset includes 4-hour intervals up to January 2025, but the specific 1-hour data for June 14 isn't covered. Result [13] provides minute-level data up to the present, but without access to the actual CSV, I can't extract the exact numbers.\n\nResult [6] from CoinMarketCap has a table showing the BTC/USDT rates for each day, including June 14 at 105,331.56 USDT. However, this is daily data, not hourly. The 24-hour change is mentioned as 0.87%, but that's over a full day, not the specific 1-hour window.\n\nResult [2] from CentralCharts provides a technical analysis on a 1-hour timeframe as of May 14, 2025, which is outdated. Result [15] from Binance Futures shows the 24-hour high and low but not the specific 1-hour candle.\n\nSince the exact open and close prices for the 1-hour candle aren't directly available in the provided search results, I need to infer based on the available data. The current price around 6 AM UTC is approximately 105,321 USDT. If the price at the start of the candle (5 AM UTC) was lower than this, the change would be positive. However, without the exact open price, it's challenging to determine definitively.\n\nGiven the user's previous response was p2 (Up) and they're asking to check again, perhaps the initial assumption was based on the overall positive trend. However, without concrete data for that specific hour, the resolution should default to p4 if information is insufficient. But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Up if the change is >=0. \n\nConsidering the market's reliance on Binance's data and the lack of conflicting information, if the price at 6 AM UTC is around the same or higher than at 5 AM, the change would be non-negative. Since the current price is stable around 105k, and assuming no major drop occurred in that hour, the most probable outcome is Up (p2). However, without explicit data, there's uncertainty. But the user's guidelines state to resolve based on probable outcome if the event has passed. Hence, p2 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.005, ID: 99152294815466357212642094545225856354849875918174929688149622303901419656319, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.995, ID: 79567047675905517813650481465746127436562718175642571091524863469423923318307, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on whether the BTC/USDT 1-hour candle starting June 14, 1 AM ET (which would be 5 AM UTC) had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution source is Binance's data for that specific candle.\n\nFirst, I need to check the current date and time. The given timestamp is June 14, 2025, 6:00:49 UTC. The event in question is the 1-hour candle starting at 5 AM UTC on the same day. Since the current time is 6 AM UTC, the candle would have closed at 6 AM UTC. So the data should be available now.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are several sources that discuss fetching historical klines from Binance. Results [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [15] provide methods to retrieve candle data. The Binance API endpoints (as per [1] and [19]) allow fetching klines with specific intervals and times. \n\nSearch result [10] mentions a sharp price increase for BTC around 10 AM UTC on June 14, but that's later than our candle's time. Result [13] discusses a price surge on June 10, which is before our event. Result [7] shows the futures price, but the resolution is based on the spot market. \n\nThe key is to find the exact 1-hour candle from 5 AM to 6 AM UTC on June 14, 2025. However, none of the provided search results include real-time data for that specific time. The Kaggle datasets ([11], [14], [15]) have historical data up to 2024 or earlier. The Cryptowatch SDK ([16], [17], [18]) could fetch real-time data, but the user's personalization instructs to use only provided URLs unless specified, and the user hasn't provided a URL here.\n\nGiven the lack of direct data in the search results, I need to infer. The user's previous response was p2 (Up), but they want a different approach. Since the event time has passed, and assuming no data indicates a negative change, the default would be to resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, without explicit data, the correct resolution might be p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no data is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Up (change >=0). If we can't find the exact data, but the market conditions suggest that without evidence of a drop, it's safer to assume the status quo, which might be a positive or neutral change. However, without concrete data, this is uncertain.\n\nWait, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. The condition here is change >=0. If there's no data, but the default is to assume the condition is met (since the user's previous answer was p2), maybe the correct approach is to stick with p2. But the user wants a different approach. Maybe check alternative sources. \n\nLooking again, result [10] mentions a price increase starting at 10 AM UTC, but our candle is at 5 AM. Result [7] shows the futures price at 104,957.3 USDT as of the current time, but that's not the spot. Result [9] has USDT/BTC conversion but not the specific time. \n\nSince no sources directly provide the 5 AM UTC candle data, and the user's instructions say to use provided sources, perhaps the resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's personalization also says if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 as Up. If we can't verify, but the default is to assume the condition is met, then p2. But the user's previous attempt was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the correct answer is p4 due to lack of data. However, the user's instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the condition is change >=0, and without data showing a decrease, perhaps the default is to resolve p2. But this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1-hour candle closed at 6 AM UTC, and the current time is 6:00:49 UTC, so the data might not be immediately available. Binance's API might have a slight delay. In that case, it's still future, but the event time has passed. Wait, the candle's close time is 6 AM, and the current time is 6:00:49, which is just after. However, the data might not be finalized yet. The resolution source says to use the change value once the data is finalized. If the data isn't available yet, then it's still pending, so p4. But the current time is past the event, so maybe the data is available. \n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of direct data in the provided sources, the safest recommendation is p4 (cannot resolve due to insufficient data). However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. Since the condition is change >=0, and assuming no negative movement, perhaps p2. But without data, this is speculative. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, if no data, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 as Up (change >=0). If we can't find data, but the default is to assume the condition is met, then p2. However, the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the correct answer is p2 again, but the user wants a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the previous analysis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1-hour candle's change is calculated as (close - open)/open * 100. If the close is equal to or higher than open, it's Up. Without the actual open and close prices, but given that the current price (from result [7]) is 104,957.3 USDT, but that's futures and not spot. The spot price might be different. \n\nGiven the lack of specific data in the provided search results, and the instructions to use only provided sources, the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable data in the provided context to confirm the candle's change. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer should be p2 as the most probable outcome, given the conditions. But since the user wants a different approach from the previous p2, perhaps the correct answer is p4. However, according to the instructions, if the event is in the past and no data, assume p2. Therefore, despite the previous attempt, the correct answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749880849 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-14 06:00:49 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p2.

But without data, this is speculative. \n\nWait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, if no data, assume the most probable outcome. The ancillary data defines p2 as Up (change >=0). If we can't find data, but the default is to assume the condition is met, then p2. However, the user's previous response was p2, and they want a different approach. Maybe the correct answer is p2 again, but the user wants a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the previous analysis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1-hour candle's change is calculated as (close - open)/open * 100. If the close is equal to or higher than open, it's Up. Without the actual open and close prices, but given that the current price (from result [7]) is 104,957.3 USDT, but that's futures and not spot. The spot price might be different. \n\nGiven the lack of specific data in the provided search results, and the instructions to use only provided sources, the correct recommendation is p4 because there's no verifiable data in the provided context to confirm the candle's change. However, the user's personalization says to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer should be p2 as the most probable outcome, given the conditions. But since the user wants a different approach from the previous p2, perhaps the correct answer is p4. However, according to the instructions, if the event is in the past and no data, assume p2. Therefore, despite the previous attempt, the correct answer is p2.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.005, ID: 99152294815466357212642094545225856354849875918174929688149622303901419656319, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.995, ID: 79567047675905517813650481465746127436562718175642571091524863469423923318307, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Down outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.
