Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749161824 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 22:17:04 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nMLB_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not MLB_API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# API configuration\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": MLB_API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/mlb-proxy\"\n\n# Resolution map\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Padres\": \"p2\",\n    \"Giants\": \"p1\",\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\"\n}\n\n# Function to make API requests\ndef make_api_request(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.RequestException:\n        try:\n            # Fallback to proxy endpoint\n            proxy_url = PROXY_ENDPOINT + url[len(PRIMARY_ENDPOINT):]\n            response = requests.get(proxy_url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            return response.json()\n        except requests.RequestException as e:\n            print(f\"Failed to retrieve data from both primary and proxy endpoints: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n# Function to determine the outcome of the game\ndef determine_outcome(game_date, home_team, away_team):\n    date_str = game_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    games_today = make_api_request(f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{date_str}\")\n\n    if games_today is None:\n        return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n    for game in games_today:\n        if game[\"HomeTeam\"] == home_team and game[\"AwayTeam\"] == away_team:\n            if game[\"Status\"] == \"Final\":\n                if game[\"HomeTeamRuns\"] > game[\"AwayTeamRuns\"]:\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[home_team]\n                elif game[\"HomeTeamRuns\"] < game[\"AwayTeamRuns\"]:\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[away_team]\n            elif game[\"Status\"] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n            else:\n                return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    game_date = datetime.strptime(\"2025-06-05 15:45\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n    home_team = \"Giants\"\n    away_team = \"Padres\"\n    result = determine_outcome(game_date, home_team, away_team)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {result}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nFailed to retrieve data from both primary and proxy endpoints: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/mlb-proxy/GamesByDate/2025-06-05\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nFailed to retrieve data from both primary and proxy endpoints: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/mlb-proxy/GamesByDate/2025-06-05\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Padres, Price: 0.17, ID: 90743062460136069747406855648470245709788735761295139483631164765360688179577, Winner: No\n- Token: Giants, Price: 0.83, ID: 51592677164539915640981533335716536500041708326088841431260758667987345305359, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Giants, p2 = Padres\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Giants outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.830 = 83.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749161824 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 22:17:04 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Configuration for headers and API endpoints\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/sportsdata-io-proxy/mlb\"\n\n# Resolution map based on the game outcome\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Padres\": \"p2\",\n    \"Giants\": \"p1\",\n    \"Postponed\": \"p4\",\n    \"Canceled\": \"p3\",\n    \"Unknown\": \"p4\"\n}\n\n# Function to make API requests\ndef make_api_request(url):\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        return response.json()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Function to find the game and determine the outcome\ndef resolve_game(date, team1, team2):\n    formatted_date = datetime.strptime(date, \"%Y-%m-%d\").strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{formatted_date}\"\n    games = make_api_request(url)\n    if games is None:\n        print(\"Using proxy endpoint due to primary endpoint failure.\")\n        url = f\"{PROXY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{formatted_date}\"\n        games = make_api_request(url)\n        if games is None:\n            return \"p4\"  # Unable to resolve due to API failure\n\n    for game in games:\n        if {game[\"HomeTeam\"], game[\"AwayTeam\"]} == {team1, team2}:\n            if game[\"Status\"] == \"Final\":\n                if game[\"HomeTeamRuns\"] > game[\"AwayTeamRuns\"]:\n                    winner = game[\"HomeTeam\"]\n                else:\n                    winner = game[\"AwayTeam\"]\n                return RESOLUTION_MAP.get(winner, \"p4\")\n            elif game[\"Status\"] in [\"Postponed\", \"Canceled\"]:\n                return RESOLUTION_MAP[game[\"Status\"]]\n            else:\n                return \"p4\"  # Game not completed yet\n\n    return \"p4\"  # No game found or other unknown status\n\n# Main execution function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    date_of_game = \"2025-06-05\"\n    home_team = \"Giants\"\n    away_team = \"Padres\"\n    result = resolve_game(date_of_game, home_team, away_team)\n    print(f\"recommendation: {result}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-05\nUsing proxy endpoint due to primary endpoint failure.\nError: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/sportsdata-io-proxy/mlb/GamesByDate/2025-06-05\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful.

Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Giants, p2 = Padres\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Giants outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.830 = 83.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.

For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749161824 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 22:17:04 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure API keys are valid and operational. Consider using a different data source or method to verify the game outcome. Additionally, adjust the code to handle scenarios where the game might still be in progress at the time of the query.\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# API configuration\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nPRIMARY_ENDPOINT = \"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json\"\nPROXY_ENDPOINT = \"https://minimal-ubuntu-production.up.railway.app/sportsdata-io-proxy/mlb\"\n\n# Game details\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-06-05\"\nHOME_TEAM = \"San Francisco Giants\"\nAWAY_TEAM = \"San Diego Padres\"\n\n# Resolution map\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    HOME_TEAM: \"p1\",\n    AWAY_TEAM: \"p2\",\n    \"Postponed\": \"p4\",\n    \"Canceled\": \"p3\",\n    \"Unknown\": \"p4\"\n}\n\ndef get_games_by_date(date):\n    url = f\"{PRIMARY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{date}\"\n    proxy_url = f\"{PROXY_ENDPOINT}/GamesByDate/{date}\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(proxy_url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n        if not response.ok:\n            raise Exception(\"Proxy failed\")\n    except:\n        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS, timeout=10)\n    if response.ok:\n        return response.json()\n    return None\n\ndef resolve_market(games):\n    for game in games:\n        if game['HomeTeam'] == HOME_TEAM and game['AwayTeam'] == AWAY_TEAM:\n            if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                home_score = game['HomeTeamRuns']\n                away_score = game['AwayTeamRuns']\n                if home_score > away_score:\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[HOME_TEAM]\n                elif away_score > home_score:\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[AWAY_TEAM]\n            elif game['Status'] in [\"Postponed\", \"Canceled\"]:\n                return RESOLUTION_MAP[game['Status']]\n    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Unknown\"]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    games = get_games_by_date(GAME_DATE)\n    if games:\n        recommendation = resolve_market(games)\n    else:\n        recommendation = RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Unknown\"]\n    print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nrecommendation: p4\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful. Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Padres, Price: 0.17, ID: 90743062460136069747406855648470245709788735761295139483631164765360688179577, Winner: No\n- Token: Giants, Price: 0.83, ID: 51592677164539915640981533335716536500041708326088841431260758667987345305359, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Giants, p2 = Padres\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Giants outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.830 = 83.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749161824 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 22:17:04 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4. Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please ensure API keys are valid and operational.

Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Giants, p2 = Padres\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Giants outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.830 = 83.0% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Padres vs. Giants game on June 5, 2025, at 3:45 PM ET. The resolution depends on which team wins. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current timestamp given is June 5, 2025, 22:17:04 UTC, which is 10:17 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 3:45 PM ET, which is 7:45 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the scheduled game time, the game should have concluded.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the outcome of the game. Results [1], [2], [6], [9], and [14] all mention that the Giants won the game on June 4 with a score of 6-5. However, the user's query is about the game on June 5. Wait, there's a bit of confusion here. The search results from [4] and [11] mention the game on June 5 with starting pitchers Dylan Cease and Robbie Ray. But the other results like [1], [2], etc., are from June 4. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game scheduled for June 5 at 3:45 PM ET. The search results include a game on June 4 where the Giants won 6-5, but the June 5 game is between Cease and Ray. However, in the search results, [4] is a prediction for the June 5 game, and [11] provides the box score for June 5. Looking at [11], the box score shows the Giants as the home team, but the detailed stats might not be filled yet. However, result [16] mentions Manny Machado hitting a home run on June 5, which suggests the game occurred. But the detailed results from [1], [2], etc., are from June 4. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user's query is about the June 5 game, but the search results provided include games from June 3, 4, and 5. Let me check again. Result [4] is from June 5 and talks about the upcoming game with Cease and Ray. Result [11] is the box score for June 5, but the content might not be fully updated. Result [16] is a video from June 5 showing Machado's home run, which would be part of the June 5 game. However, the detailed game recap in [1], [2], [6], [9], and [14] are from June 4. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date? The ancillary data mentions the game on June 5, but the search results for June 5's game might not have a conclusive result yet. However, the current timestamp is June 5, 2025, 10:17 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. Therefore, the game should have been played. \n\nLooking at result [11], the box score for June 5 shows the starting pitchers as Cease and Ray, but the outcome isn't clear. However, result [16] shows Machado hitting a home run in the top of the 3rd inning, which would be part of the June 5 game. But without a final score in the search results, I need to check other sources. \n\nWait, result [4] is a prediction article from June 5, which doesn't provide the result. The other results from June 5 ([11], [16]) don't give the final score. The most recent game detailed in the search results is June 4, where the Giants won. The June 5 game might not have been covered in the provided search results, or perhaps the user provided incomplete data. \n\nBut according to the personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the user provided search results up to [17], which includes a video from June 5 showing Machado's home run, but that's just a highlight. Without a clear result in the search results for June 5, but considering the timestamp is after the game, I need to check if any of the search results mention the June 5 outcome. \n\nWait, result [14] is a YouTube video titled \"San Diego Padres vs San Francisco Giants - FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | June 4, 2025 MLB Season.\" Result [15] is June 3, and [16] is June 5 but only a home run clip. Result [17] is June 3. The other results ([1], [2], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13]) are from June 4 or earlier. \n\nTherefore, the provided search results do not include the outcome of the June 5 game. However, the current date is June 5, 2025, and the game was scheduled for 3:45 PM ET, which has already occurred. Since the search results don't provide the outcome, but the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nBut wait, the ancillary data says if the game is postponed or canceled, resolve accordingly. Since the search results don't mention postponement or cancellation, and the game was scheduled, we have to assume it was played. Without verifiable information, but the user's instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say if no information is available, default to p4. But p4 isn't defined in the resolution_conditions. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Giants, p2: Padres, p3: 50-50. The user might have a typo, but based on the given data, if the game happened but no info is in the search results, perhaps it's unresolved. However, the personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions in the user prompt. \n\nThe user prompt's ancillary data defines p1 as Giants, p2 as Padres. If the game was played but no info, perhaps we have to default to p4, but the resolution_conditions don't include p4. Wait, looking back, the resolution_conditions are p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. The description says p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50. So if the game's outcome isn't found in the search results, but the event date is in the past, and assuming it wasn't postponed or canceled, we have to resolve as p3 (50-50) only if canceled. Since it's not canceled, but no info, perhaps the resolution is p3. However, the personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nBut without any data, how to determine the probable outcome? The starting pitchers were Cease (1-4, 4.66 ERA) vs. Ray (7-1, 2.43 ERA). Based on that, the Giants might have an edge, but that's speculative. However, the instructions say to base the resolution strictly on verified facts. Since there's no verified result in the provided search results, and the event date is in the past, the correct resolution would be p3 (unknown/50-50) only if the game was canceled. Since there's no info on cancellation, but the game was scheduled, it's possible that the game was played, but the result isn't in the provided sources. \n\nHowever, the user might have provided incomplete search results. Given that, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct resolution would be p4, but the resolution_conditions don't include p4. Wait, the user's resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. The personalization instructions say to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. The ancillary data says p3 is 50-50 for canceled. Since the game wasn't canceled, and assuming it was played but no result found, perhaps the resolution is p3 isn't appropriate. \n\nThis is confusing. The user's instructions are a bit conflicting. But given that the search results do not include the June 5 game's outcome, and the current date is after the game's scheduled time, but no info is present, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the safe answer is p4. However, the resolution_conditions don't have p4. Wait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\nBut the personalization instructions say to recommend p1, p2, p3, or p4. The ancillary data's p3 is for canceled games. If the game was played but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Since the conditions don't provide a default for played but unreported games, perhaps the resolution is p3 (50-50) only if canceled. Since it's not canceled, and the game was played, but no result is found, perhaps the resolution is p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the June 5 game is the one covered in the search results. Wait, result [1] and [2] are from June 4, but [4] is a prediction for June 5. Result [11] is the box score for June 5, but the content shows the lineups and probable pitchers but doesn't show the final score. Result [16] is a highlight from June 5, showing Machado's HR, which suggests the game was played. If Machado hit a HR, but the Giants won, but there's no final score in the search results. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and the game in question is the June 4 game, but the query is about June 5. This is conflicting. Given the confusion, and following the instructions strictly, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, resolve as p3. But since the game was played (as per [16]), but the result isn't clear, perhaps the resolution is p1 or p2 based on the available info. \n\nWait, result [16] shows Machado hitting a HR in the top of the 3rd, giving the Padres a 2-0 lead. But that's just one play. The final outcome isn't mentioned. Without the final score, I can't determine the winner. Therefore, based on the provided search results, there's no information on the June 5 game's outcome. Hence, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, resolve as p3 (50-50) only if canceled. Since it's not canceled, but the result isn't available, the correct resolution is p4. However, the resolution_conditions don't have p4. The user might have a typo, but given the options, the safest recommendation is p4, even though it's not listed. Alternatively, since the game was played but the result isn't in the search results, perhaps it's considered unknown, leading to p3. But p3 is for canceled games. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. The user's instructions are a bit conflicting. However, based on strict adherence, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, and the game wasn't canceled, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to resolve a market based on the outcome of the Padres vs. Giants game on June 5, 2025, at 3:45 PM ET. The resolution depends on which team wins. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current timestamp given is June 5, 2025, 22:17:04 UTC, which is 10:17 PM UTC. The game was scheduled for 3:45 PM ET, which is 7:45 PM UTC. Since the current time is after the scheduled game time, the game should have concluded.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple sources indicating the outcome of the game. Results [1], [2], [6], [9], and [14] all mention that the Giants won the game on June 4 with a score of 6-5. However, the user's query is about the game on June 5. Wait, there's a bit of confusion here. The search results from [4] and [11] mention the game on June 5 with starting pitchers Dylan Cease and Robbie Ray. But the other results like [1], [2], etc., are from June 4. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the game scheduled for June 5 at 3:45 PM ET. The search results include a game on June 4 where the Giants won 6-5, but the June 5 game is between Cease and Ray. However, in the search results, [4] is a prediction for the June 5 game, and [11] provides the box score for June 5. Looking at [11], the box score shows the Giants as the home team, but the detailed stats might not be filled yet. However, result [16] mentions Manny Machado hitting a home run on June 5, which suggests the game occurred. But the detailed results from [1], [2], etc., are from June 4. \n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. The user's query is about the June 5 game, but the search results provided include games from June 3, 4, and 5. Let me check again. Result [4] is from June 5 and talks about the upcoming game with Cease and Ray. Result [11] is the box score for June 5, but the content might not be fully updated. Result [16] is a video from June 5 showing Machado's home run, which would be part of the June 5 game. However, the detailed game recap in [1], [2], [6], [9], and [14] are from June 4. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the date? The ancillary data mentions the game on June 5, but the search results for June 5's game might not have a conclusive result yet. However, the current timestamp is June 5, 2025, 10:17 PM UTC, which is after the game's scheduled time. Therefore, the game should have been played. \n\nLooking at result [11], the box score for June 5 shows the starting pitchers as Cease and Ray, but the outcome isn't clear. However, result [16] shows Machado hitting a home run in the top of the 3rd inning, which would be part of the June 5 game. But without a final score in the search results, I need to check other sources. \n\nWait, result [4] is a prediction article from June 5, which doesn't provide the result. The other results from June 5 ([11], [16]) don't give the final score. The most recent game detailed in the search results is June 4, where the Giants won. The June 5 game might not have been covered in the provided search results, or perhaps the user provided incomplete data. \n\nBut according to the personalization instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. However, the user provided search results up to [17], which includes a video from June 5 showing Machado's home run, but that's just a highlight. Without a clear result in the search results for June 5, but considering the timestamp is after the game, I need to check if any of the search results mention the June 5 outcome. \n\nWait, result [14] is a YouTube video titled \"San Diego Padres vs San Francisco Giants - FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | June 4, 2025 MLB Season.\" Result [15] is June 3, and [16] is June 5 but only a home run clip. Result [17] is June 3. The other results ([1], [2], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13]) are from June 4 or earlier. \n\nTherefore, the provided search results do not include the outcome of the June 5 game. However, the current date is June 5, 2025, and the game was scheduled for 3:45 PM ET, which has already occurred. Since the search results don't provide the outcome, but the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no information is available, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nBut wait, the ancillary data says if the game is postponed or canceled, resolve accordingly. Since the search results don't mention postponement or cancellation, and the game was scheduled, we have to assume it was played. Without verifiable information, but the user's instruction says to resolve based on the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say if no information is available, default to p4. But p4 isn't defined in the resolution_conditions. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: Giants, p2: Padres, p3: 50-50. The user might have a typo, but based on the given data, if the game happened but no info is in the search results, perhaps it's unresolved. However, the personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions in the user prompt. \n\nThe user prompt's ancillary data defines p1 as Giants, p2 as Padres. If the game was played but no info, perhaps we have to default to p4, but the resolution_conditions don't include p4. Wait, looking back, the resolution_conditions are p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. The description says p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50. So if the game's outcome isn't found in the search results, but the event date is in the past, and assuming it wasn't postponed or canceled, we have to resolve as p3 (50-50) only if canceled. Since it's not canceled, but no info, perhaps the resolution is p3. However, the personalization instructions say if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. \n\nBut without any data, how to determine the probable outcome? The starting pitchers were Cease (1-4, 4.66 ERA) vs. Ray (7-1, 2.43 ERA). Based on that, the Giants might have an edge, but that's speculative. However, the instructions say to base the resolution strictly on verified facts. Since there's no verified result in the provided search results, and the event date is in the past, the correct resolution would be p3 (unknown/50-50) only if the game was canceled. Since there's no info on cancellation, but the game was scheduled, it's possible that the game was played, but the result isn't in the provided sources. \n\nHowever, the user might have provided incomplete search results. Given that, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct resolution would be p4, but the resolution_conditions don't include p4. Wait, the user's resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. The personalization instructions say to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. The ancillary data says p3 is 50-50 for canceled. Since the game wasn't canceled, and assuming it was played but no result found, perhaps the resolution is p3 isn't appropriate. \n\nThis is confusing. The user's instructions are a bit conflicting. But given that the search results do not include the June 5 game's outcome, and the current date is after the game's scheduled time, but no info is present, the correct resolution would be p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). However, the personalization instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the safe answer is p4. However, the resolution_conditions don't have p4. Wait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\nBut the personalization instructions say to recommend p1, p2, p3, or p4. The ancillary data's p3 is for canceled games. If the game was played but no result is found, it's unclear. However, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions. Since the conditions don't provide a default for played but unreported games, perhaps the resolution is p3 (50-50) only if canceled. Since it's not canceled, and the game was played, but no result is found, perhaps the resolution is p4. But the user's resolution_conditions don't include p4. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the June 5 game is the one covered in the search results. Wait, result [1] and [2] are from June 4, but [4] is a prediction for June 5. Result [11] is the box score for June 5, but the content shows the lineups and probable pitchers but doesn't show the final score. Result [16] is a highlight from June 5, showing Machado's HR, which suggests the game was played. If Machado hit a HR, but the Giants won, but there's no final score in the search results. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and the game in question is the June 4 game, but the query is about June 5. This is conflicting. Given the confusion, and following the instructions strictly, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is available, resolve as p3. But since the game was played (as per [16]), but the result isn't clear, perhaps the resolution is p1 or p2 based on the available info. \n\nWait, result [16] shows Machado hitting a HR in the top of the 3rd, giving the Padres a 2-0 lead. But that's just one play. The final outcome isn't mentioned. Without the final score, I can't determine the winner. Therefore, based on the provided search results, there's no information on the June 5 game's outcome. Hence, according to the instructions, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, resolve as p3 (50-50) only if canceled. Since it's not canceled, but the result isn't available, the correct resolution is p4. However, the resolution_conditions don't have p4. The user might have a typo, but given the options, the safest recommendation is p4, even though it's not listed. Alternatively, since the game was played but the result isn't in the search results, perhaps it's considered unknown, leading to p3. But p3 is for canceled games. \n\nThis is a tricky situation. The user's instructions are a bit conflicting. However, based on strict adherence, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info, and the game wasn't canceled, the resolution should be based on the most probable outcome. But without any data, it's impossible. Therefore, the correct recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Padres, Price: 0.17, ID: 90743062460136069747406855648470245709788735761295139483631164765360688179577, Winner: No\n- Token: Giants, Price: 0.83, ID: 51592677164539915640981533335716536500041708326088841431260758667987345305359, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5.

Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Since the game was played and the Giants won, the correct resolution should be p1. \n\nI should also check if there's any conflicting information. All the sources I found consistently report the Giants' victory. There's no mention of the game being incomplete or disputed. Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Padres, Price: 0.17, ID: 90743062460136069747406855648470245709788735761295139483631164765360688179577, Winner: No\n- Token: Giants, Price: 0.83, ID: 51592677164539915640981533335716536500041708326088841431260758667987345305359, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Giants, p2 to Padres, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Giants, p2 = Padres\n\nInterpretation: Market moderately favors Giants outcome (maps to p1 in resolution conditions) (0.830 = 83.0% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749161824 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-05 22:17:04 UTC",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources.
