      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Biden\" five or more times during his May 16, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News. The resolution depends on the actual occurrence in the interview, and the sources provided include various transcripts and articles related to Trump's interviews and statements.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of the May 16 interview. Looking at the provided sources, there's a mention in [63] that Bret Baier will interview Trump on May 16, 2025, from the UAE. The interview is part of Fox News' special coverage of Trump's Middle East trip. \n\nNext, I need to determine if there's any existing transcript or report from that specific interview. The search results include several transcripts of Trump's past interviews with Bret Baier, such as [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [9], [12], [15], [41], [42], [43], [44], [47], [52], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [62], [63], and [64]. However, most of these are from earlier dates, like March 2025, February 2025, or even 2016-2020. \n\nThe key source here is [24], which is an archive of the May 16, 2025, Special Report episode. The transcript excerpt shows Trump discussing the assassination attempt, his stamina, and interactions with the Secret Service. In the provided snippet, Trump mentions \"Biden\" at least once when talking about the investigation into the assassination attempt: \"Biden\u2019s response to the shooting showed he has the temperament of a leader.\" However, the full transcript isn't available here, so I can't confirm the exact count.\n\nAnother relevant source is [27], which discusses Biden's cognitive issues and the 2024 debate. While this isn't the May 16 interview, it shows that Trump often references Biden in his speeches. Similarly, [28] and [32] mention Biden in the context of the Hur report and executive privilege, but these are from different dates.\n\nGiven that Trump frequently mentions Biden in his interviews, especially when discussing current events or contrasting his policies, it's plausible he would say \"Biden\" multiple times. However, without the full transcript of the May 16 interview, I can't definitively count the instances. The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is the audio/video of the interview, which isn't fully provided here. \n\nBased on the available information from [24] where Biden is mentioned at least once, and considering Trump's typical rhetoric, it's likely he mentioned Biden multiple times. However, without the full transcript, there's uncertainty. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the term is said five or more times. Since the provided snippet only shows one instance, but Trump's pattern suggests more, I might lean towards \"Yes,\" but the evidence isn't conclusive. However, the user's instructions state to resolve based on the provided search results. Since the only direct mention in the May 16 transcript is once, and no other instances are shown, it's possible the count is under five. But this is speculative. \n\nWait, in [24], the transcript excerpt includes Trump saying, \"Biden\u2019s response to the shooting showed he has the temperament of a leader.\" That's one mention. If the full interview includes more references, but the provided data doesn't show them, I can't assume. The user's instructions say to use the provided search results. Since the only mention is once, and the requirement is five or more, the answer would be \"No.\" However, considering Trump's tendency to mention Biden frequently, there might be more instances not captured in the provided snippets. But per the strict evidence here, it's only once. \n\nBut wait, the user's query is about the May 16 interview, and the search result [24] is from May 16, 2025. The transcript snippet there shows Trump discussing the assassination attempt and mentioning Biden once. Without more context, I can't confirm five mentions. Therefore, based on the provided data, the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). However, if the actual interview had more mentions, but the provided sources don't show them, the assistant must rely on the given information. \n\nAlternatively, if the assistant infers that Trump likely mentioned Biden multiple times in a political interview, especially discussing current events where Biden is a key figure, it might lean towards \"Yes.\" But given the strict evidence here, only one mention is visible. Therefore, the resolution would be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\n**recommendation: p1** \n\nThe provided search results include a transcript excerpt from the May 16, 2025, interview ([24]), which shows Trump mentioning \"Biden\" once in the context of discussing the Secret Service investigation into assassination attempts. No additional instances of \"Biden\" are documented in the available excerpts.

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749061293 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-04 18:21:33 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Donald Trump will say \"Biden\" five or more times during his May 16, 2025 interview with Bret Baier on Fox News. The resolution depends on the actual occurrence in the interview, and the sources provided include various transcripts and articles related to Trump's interviews and statements.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results for any mention of the May 16 interview. Looking at the provided sources, there's a mention in [63] that Bret Baier will interview Trump on May 16, 2025, from the UAE. The interview is part of Fox News' special coverage of Trump's Middle East trip. \n\nNext, I need to determine if there's any existing transcript or report from that specific interview. The search results include several transcripts of Trump's past interviews with Bret Baier, such as [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [9], [12], [15], [41], [42], [43], [44], [47], [52], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [62], [63], and [64]. However, most of these are from earlier dates, like March 2025, February 2025, or even 2016-2020. \n\nThe key source here is [24], which is an archive of the May 16, 2025, Special Report episode. The transcript excerpt shows Trump discussing the assassination attempt, his stamina, and interactions with the Secret Service. In the provided snippet, Trump mentions \"Biden\" at least once when talking about the investigation into the assassination attempt: \"Biden\u2019s response to the shooting showed he has the temperament of a leader.\" However, the full transcript isn't available here, so I can't confirm the exact count.\n\nAnother relevant source is [27], which discusses Biden's cognitive issues and the 2024 debate. While this isn't the May 16 interview, it shows that Trump often references Biden in his speeches. Similarly, [28] and [32] mention Biden in the context of the Hur report and executive privilege, but these are from different dates.\n\nGiven that Trump frequently mentions Biden in his interviews, especially when discussing current events or contrasting his policies, it's plausible he would say \"Biden\" multiple times. However, without the full transcript of the May 16 interview, I can't definitively count the instances. The user's ancillary data specifies that the resolution source is the audio/video of the interview, which isn't fully provided here. \n\nBased on the available information from [24] where Biden is mentioned at least once, and considering Trump's typical rhetoric, it's likely he mentioned Biden multiple times. However, without the full transcript, there's uncertainty. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if the term is said five or more times. Since the provided snippet only shows one instance, but Trump's pattern suggests more, I might lean towards \"Yes,\" but the evidence isn't conclusive. However, the user's instructions state to resolve based on the provided search results. Since the only direct mention in the May 16 transcript is once, and no other instances are shown, it's possible the count is under five. But this is speculative. \n\nWait, in [24], the transcript excerpt includes Trump saying, \"Biden\u2019s response to the shooting showed he has the temperament of a leader.\" That's one mention. If the full interview includes more references, but the provided data doesn't show them, I can't assume. The user's instructions say to use the provided search results. Since the only mention is once, and the requirement is five or more, the answer would be \"No.\" However, considering Trump's tendency to mention Biden frequently, there might be more instances not captured in the provided snippets. But per the strict evidence here, it's only once. \n\nBut wait, the user's query is about the May 16 interview, and the search result [24] is from May 16, 2025. The transcript snippet there shows Trump discussing the assassination attempt and mentioning Biden once. Without more context, I can't confirm five mentions. Therefore, based on the provided data, the resolution would be \"No\" (p1). However, if the actual interview had more mentions, but the provided sources don't show them, the assistant must rely on the given information. \n\nAlternatively, if the assistant infers that Trump likely mentioned Biden multiple times in a political interview, especially discussing current events where Biden is a key figure, it might lean towards \"Yes.\" But given the strict evidence here, only one mention is visible. Therefore, the resolution would be \"No.\"\n</think>\n\n**recommendation: p1** \n\nThe provided search results include a transcript excerpt from the May 16, 2025, interview ([24]), which shows Trump mentioning \"Biden\" once in the context of discussing the Secret Service investigation into assassination attempts. No additional instances of \"Biden\" are documented in the available excerpts. While Trump frequently references Biden in other contexts (e.g., policy comparisons, cognitive critiques), the explicit evidence from the May 16 interview does not meet the threshold of 5+ mentions. Per the resolution rules, the market resolves to **No** based on the verifiable data provided.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.5, ID: 60909528322018840608242985341689800198852964976916008246068581598912377996378, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.5, ID: 62529293462184498480222142025808900396531258327200722300924344328673527770667, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.500, NO: 0.500)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
