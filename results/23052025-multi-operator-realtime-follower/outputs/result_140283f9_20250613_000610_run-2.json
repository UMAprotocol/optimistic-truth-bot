The ancillary data specifies that if G2 wins, it's p2; if paiN wins, p1; and if it's a tie or canceled, p3. The resolution source is HLTV, so I need to check the provided search results for any information about this match.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results to find mentions of this specific match. The user mentioned the match is on June 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. Let's check the dates in the search results. Result [3] mentions a match on 2025-06-12 between G2 and paiN in CS2, which aligns with the query. The result states that the match is part of the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 and is a BO1 format. The bookmakers predicted paiN to win with odds of 1.78, but the actual result isn't directly stated here.\n\nLooking at result [17], there's a match entry from Strafe.com indicating that G2 won 1-0 against paiN on June 12, 2025, in the Swiss Round 2 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major. This seems to be the exact match in question. The result is confirmed here, so G2 won the match.\n\nAdditionally, result [18] provides detailed stats from the match, showing G2 won 13-6 on de_dust2. This further confirms the outcome. The HLTV link provided in the ancillary data (result [1]) is the official source, and since the match has already occurred (as per the current date in the system prompt being June 13, 2025), the result is definitive.\n\nThere's no mention of a tie, cancellation, or delay in the search results. All sources point to G2 winning the match. Therefore, the resolution should be p2.\n</think>\n\n# BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025: G2 Esports vs. paiN Gaming Round 2 Resolution  \n\nThe match between **G2 Esports** and **paiN Gaming** in **Round 2** of the **BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025** concluded with **G2 Esports** securing a decisive victory. This resolution aligns with the ancillary data provided, where a G2 win corresponds to **p2**. Below is a detailed analysis of the match, its context, and the broader implications for both teams.  \n\n---\n\n## Match Overview and Outcome  \n\nThe **G2 Esports vs. paiN Gaming** encounter took place on **June 12, 2025**, as part of the Swiss Stage Round 2 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The match was a **Best-of-1 (BO1)** series on the map **de_dust2**, with G2 emerging victorious by a score of **13-6**[17][18].  \n\n### Key Statistics and Performance  \n- **G2 Esports** dominated the map, securing a **9-3** lead in the first half and maintaining control in the second half (**4-3**)[18].  \n- **Snax** (G2) led the server with **20 kills** (16 headshots), while **huNter-** and **hades** contributed **16 kills each**[18].  \n- **paiN Gaming** struggled to contain G2\u2019s offensive pressure, with **biguzera** and **nqz** managing **10 and 14 kills**, respectively, but failing to stem the tide[18].  \n\nThis result marked G2\u2019s first win in the Swiss Stage, advancing them to the **1-1 bracket**, while paiN dropped to the **0-2 bracket**[17].  \n\n---\n\n## Contextual Analysis  \n\n### G2 Esports\u2019 Performance  \nG2 entered the match with a **2-0 head-to-head record** against paiN in CS2, having previously defeated them in **August 2024** and **March 2025**[3][5]. Despite recent struggles\u2014including a **2-loss streak** in their last five matches\u2014G2\u2019s tactical execution and individual skill proved decisive[3][17]. The team\u2019s ability to capitalize on early-round advantages and maintain map control underscored their resilience.  \n\n### paiN Gaming\u2019s Struggles  \npaiN, ranked **#23** in CS2 compared to G2\u2019s **#4**, faced an uphill battle[3][5]. Their **3-loss streak** in recent matches and a **13% win rate** over the past 30 days highlighted systemic issues in strategy and consistency[5]. The team\u2019s inability to adapt to G2\u2019s aggressive CT-side setups on Dust2 proved costly, as they conceded critical rounds early in the half[18].  \n\n---\n\n## Broader Implications  \n\n### For G2 Esports  \n- **Advancement in the Swiss Stage**: The win keeps G2 in contention for a **Playoffs spot**, though they must navigate subsequent rounds against stronger opponents like **Team Vitality** or **MOUZ**[9][15].  \n- **Lineup Changes**: Reports suggest G2 may undergo roster adjustments post-Major, making this match a potential \u201clast dance\u201d for their current lineup[7].  \n\n### For paiN Gaming  \n- **Elimination Risk**: A **0-2 record** in the Swiss Stage leaves paiN on the brink of elimination. They must win their next match to avoid an early exit[15].  \n- **Strategic Overhaul**: The team\u2019s reliance on **biguzera** and **nqz** for fragging highlights a lack of depth, necessitating adjustments to their map pool and in-game leadership[11][18].  \n\n---\n\n## Historical and Statistical Context  \n\n### Head-to-Head Dominance  \nG2 has historically dominated paiN in CS2, winning **100% of their encounters** (2-0 in matches, 4-0 in maps)[5]. This trend continued in Austin, with G2\u2019s superior rating (**5.49 vs. 6.61**) and tactical discipline proving decisive[3][5].  \n\n### Tournament Dynamics  \nThe **BLAST.tv Austin Major** features a **$1.25 million prize pool** and a **32-team Swiss Stage**, with top teams like **FaZe**, **Vitality**, and **NAVI** competing for the championship[2][12]. G2\u2019s victory aligns with expectations for top-tier teams to assert dominance early in the bracket[9][15].  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \n\nThe **G2 Esports vs. paiN Gaming** match resolved conclusively in favor of **G2**, with the French team demonstrating superior map control and individual skill. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data\u2019s resolution conditions, where a G2 victory corresponds to **p2**.  \n\n**Recommendation**: p2",

Where p1 corresponds to paiN, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749773051 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-13 00:04:11 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know the outcome of the G2 vs. paiN match in round 2 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025. The ancillary data specifies that if G2 wins, it's p2; if paiN wins, p1; and if it's a tie or canceled, p3. The resolution source is HLTV, so I need to check the provided search results for any information about this match.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results to find mentions of this specific match. The user mentioned the match is on June 12, 2025, at 7:30 PM ET. Let's check the dates in the search results. Result [3] mentions a match on 2025-06-12 between G2 and paiN in CS2, which aligns with the query. The result states that the match is part of the BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 and is a BO1 format. The bookmakers predicted paiN to win with odds of 1.78, but the actual result isn't directly stated here.\n\nLooking at result [17], there's a match entry from Strafe.com indicating that G2 won 1-0 against paiN on June 12, 2025, in the Swiss Round 2 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major. This seems to be the exact match in question. The result is confirmed here, so G2 won the match.\n\nAdditionally, result [18] provides detailed stats from the match, showing G2 won 13-6 on de_dust2. This further confirms the outcome. The HLTV link provided in the ancillary data (result [1]) is the official source, and since the match has already occurred (as per the current date in the system prompt being June 13, 2025), the result is definitive.\n\nThere's no mention of a tie, cancellation, or delay in the search results. All sources point to G2 winning the match. Therefore, the resolution should be p2.\n</think>\n\n# BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025: G2 Esports vs. paiN Gaming Round 2 Resolution  \n\nThe match between **G2 Esports** and **paiN Gaming** in **Round 2** of the **BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025** concluded with **G2 Esports** securing a decisive victory. This resolution aligns with the ancillary data provided, where a G2 win corresponds to **p2**. Below is a detailed analysis of the match, its context, and the broader implications for both teams.  \n\n---\n\n## Match Overview and Outcome  \n\nThe **G2 Esports vs. paiN Gaming** encounter took place on **June 12, 2025**, as part of the Swiss Stage Round 2 of the BLAST.tv Austin Major. The match was a **Best-of-1 (BO1)** series on the map **de_dust2**, with G2 emerging victorious by a score of **13-6**[17][18].  \n\n### Key Statistics and Performance  \n- **G2 Esports** dominated the map, securing a **9-3** lead in the first half and maintaining control in the second half (**4-3**)[18].  \n- **Snax** (G2) led the server with **20 kills** (16 headshots), while **huNter-** and **hades** contributed **16 kills each**[18].  \n- **paiN Gaming** struggled to contain G2\u2019s offensive pressure, with **biguzera** and **nqz** managing **10 and 14 kills**, respectively, but failing to stem the tide[18].  \n\nThis result marked G2\u2019s first win in the Swiss Stage, advancing them to the **1-1 bracket**, while paiN dropped to the **0-2 bracket**[17].  \n\n---\n\n## Contextual Analysis  \n\n### G2 Esports\u2019 Performance  \nG2 entered the match with a **2-0 head-to-head record** against paiN in CS2, having previously defeated them in **August 2024** and **March 2025**[3][5]. Despite recent struggles\u2014including a **2-loss streak** in their last five matches\u2014G2\u2019s tactical execution and individual skill proved decisive[3][17]. The team\u2019s ability to capitalize on early-round advantages and maintain map control underscored their resilience.  \n\n### paiN Gaming\u2019s Struggles  \npaiN, ranked **#23** in CS2 compared to G2\u2019s **#4**, faced an uphill battle[3][5]. Their **3-loss streak** in recent matches and a **13% win rate** over the past 30 days highlighted systemic issues in strategy and consistency[5]. The team\u2019s inability to adapt to G2\u2019s aggressive CT-side setups on Dust2 proved costly, as they conceded critical rounds early in the half[18].  \n\n---\n\n## Broader Implications  \n\n### For G2 Esports  \n- **Advancement in the Swiss Stage**: The win keeps G2 in contention for a **Playoffs spot**, though they must navigate subsequent rounds against stronger opponents like **Team Vitality** or **MOUZ**[9][15].  \n- **Lineup Changes**: Reports suggest G2 may undergo roster adjustments post-Major, making this match a potential \u201clast dance\u201d for their current lineup[7].  \n\n### For paiN Gaming  \n- **Elimination Risk**: A **0-2 record** in the Swiss Stage leaves paiN on the brink of elimination. They must win their next match to avoid an early exit[15].  \n- **Strategic Overhaul**: The team\u2019s reliance on **biguzera** and **nqz** for fragging highlights a lack of depth, necessitating adjustments to their map pool and in-game leadership[11][18].  \n\n---\n\n## Historical and Statistical Context  \n\n### Head-to-Head Dominance  \nG2 has historically dominated paiN in CS2, winning **100% of their encounters** (2-0 in matches, 4-0 in maps)[5]. This trend continued in Austin, with G2\u2019s superior rating (**5.49 vs. 6.61**) and tactical discipline proving decisive[3][5].  \n\n### Tournament Dynamics  \nThe **BLAST.tv Austin Major** features a **$1.25 million prize pool** and a **32-team Swiss Stage**, with top teams like **FaZe**, **Vitality**, and **NAVI** competing for the championship[2][12]. G2\u2019s victory aligns with expectations for top-tier teams to assert dominance early in the bracket[9][15].  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \n\nThe **G2 Esports vs. paiN Gaming** match resolved conclusively in favor of **G2**, with the French team demonstrating superior map control and individual skill. This outcome aligns with the ancillary data\u2019s resolution conditions, where a G2 victory corresponds to **p2**.  \n\n**Recommendation**: p2\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p2\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: G2, Price: 0.949, ID: 43305701996782651850123465476177323078816766802424272586786150842430438459848, Winner: No\n- Token: paiN, Price: 0.051, ID: 68908967326212818534094967719010355799893815918905845417509455143178387684885, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to paiN, p2 to G2, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = paiN, p2 = G2\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors G2 outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.949 = 94.9% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",
