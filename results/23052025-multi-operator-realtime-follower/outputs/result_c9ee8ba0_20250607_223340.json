Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Nationals, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749335221 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-07 22:27:01 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM CODE_RUNNER SOLVER:\nCODE RUNNER SOLUTION:\n\nGENERATED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAPI_KEY = os.getenv(\"SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\nif not API_KEY:\n    raise ValueError(\"Missing SPORTS_DATA_IO_MLB_API_KEY\")\n\n# Constants\nHEADERS = {\"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key\": API_KEY}\nRESOLUTION_MAP = {\n    \"Rangers\": \"p1\",\n    \"Nationals\": \"p2\",\n    \"50-50\": \"p3\",\n    \"Too early to resolve\": \"p4\"\n}\nGAME_DATE = \"2025-06-07\"\nGAME_TIME = \"16:05:00\"\n\n# Helper functions\ndef get_game_data(date):\n    url = f\"https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/{date}\"\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        return response.json()\n    else:\n        raise Exception(\"Failed to retrieve game data\")\n\ndef resolve_market(games, home_team, away_team):\n    for game in games:\n        if game['HomeTeam'] == home_team and game['AwayTeam'] == away_team:\n            if game['DateTime'] > datetime.now().isoformat():\n                return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n            if game['Status'] == \"Final\":\n                if game['HomeTeamRuns'] > game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[home_team]\n                elif game['HomeTeamRuns'] < game['AwayTeamRuns']:\n                    return RESOLUTION_MAP[away_team]\n            elif game['Status'] in [\"Canceled\", \"Postponed\"]:\n                return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"50-50\"]\n    return RESOLUTION_MAP[\"Too early to resolve\"]\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        games = get_game_data(GAME_DATE)\n        recommendation = resolve_market(games, \"TEX\", \"WAS\")\n        print(f\"recommendation: {recommendation}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {str(e)}\")\n```\n\nCODE EXECUTION OUTPUT:\n```\nError: Failed to retrieve game data\n\n```\n\nSUMMARY:\nCode execution successful, but no direct recommendation found.

Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749335221 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-07 22:27:01 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Recommendation found: p4.\n\nOutput:\nError fetching data: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mlb/scores/json/GamesByDate/2025-06-07\nrecommendation: p4\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Rangers, Price: 0.995, ID: 12307608416862682406788772174342372072870797055394555621813963668630756259724, Winner: No\n- Token: Nationals, Price: 0.005, ID: 29763651555220115779824192782677598957250098223372793669173488372911644350745, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Nationals, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Nationals, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Where p1 corresponds to Nationals, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality.

Where p1 corresponds to Nationals, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Nationals, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Texas Rangers and Washington Nationals on June 7, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Nationals win, p2 for Rangers win, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is June 7, 2025, 10:27 PM UTC, which is 6:27 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, so it should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no direct mention of the June 7 game's outcome. However, there are details about the previous game on June 6 where the Nationals won 2-0. The June 7 game is mentioned in sources [6], [8], [10], and [14]. Source [6] predicts a Rangers win, [8] lists the starting pitchers as deGrom for Rangers and Parker for Nationals, and [10] provides betting picks favoring the Rangers. Source [14] seems to be a box score placeholder but doesn't show actual results yet.\n\nSince the game time has passed, but there's no reported outcome in the provided sources, I need to check if there's any postponement or cancellation info. Sources [4] mention past postponements in May 2025, but nothing about June 7. The user's resolution conditions state that if the game is postponed, the market remains open, and if canceled, resolves to p3. However, there's no indication of postponement or cancellation in the search results.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, I should infer based on the most probable outcome. The user instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Rangers win. However, the betting predictions in [6] and [10] suggest Rangers were favored, but without confirmation, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome per the user's prompt conditions. Since the user's ancillary data doesn't specify defaulting to p3 unless canceled, and there's no evidence of cancellation, perhaps the correct resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the user's resolution_conditions are p1:0 (Nationals), p2:1 (Rangers), p3:0.5 (canceled). But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, and the user prompt doesn't mention postponement, resolve based on most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming the result, maybe it's safer to return p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Nationals, p2: Rangers, p3: canceled. Since the game was scheduled for today, and it's past the time, but no sources report the outcome, perhaps the correct answer is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But the problem is that the sources provided don't include the result of the June 7 game. All the search results about games are from June 6 or earlier. Therefore, there's no verifiable information about the June 7 game's outcome. In that case, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's prompt conditions. The user's prompt conditions in ancillary data don't specify a default, but the resolution is based on who won. Since there's no data, perhaps the market should resolve to p3 (canceled), but there's no evidence of cancellation. Alternatively, since the game was not reported as postponed or canceled, it likely occurred, but without result data, we can't confirm. However, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide a default, but the market resolves based on the actual outcome. Since there's no info, but the game was scheduled and not reported as postponed, perhaps the most probable outcome is that the game was played, but we don't know the result. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify a default, so perhaps the correct resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved). Wait, the user's personalization says: \"recommendation: p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But p4 isn't part of the resolution_conditions provided. Wait, looking back, the user's resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. But in the personalization, the instructions say to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p1, p2, p3, but the personalization allows p4. So, if the event occurred but there's no verifiable info, and it's past the date, but the outcome isn't known, perhaps the recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, in this case, the ancillary data's conditions are p1 for Nationals, p2 for Rangers, p3 for canceled. Since the game wasn't canceled, and assuming it was played, but no result is available, we have to infer the most probable outcome. The betting picks in [6] and [10] suggest Rangers were favored, but without confirmation. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided sources. Since none of the sources report the June 7 game's result, and the current timestamp is after the game, but no info is available, perhaps the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the conditions don't provide a default, but the ancillary data defines the resolution based on the actual outcome, and there's no data, perhaps the answer is p4. But the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data's conditions don't specify a default, but the market resolves based on the actual result. Since there's no data, but the game was likely played, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, which might be the Rangers as per the betting picks, but without confirmation, it's uncertain. However, the strict instruction is to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since there's no verifiable info in the provided sources about the June 7 game's outcome, the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). But wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide a default, but the resolution is based on the actual game result. Since there's no data, but the game was scheduled and not reported as postponed, perhaps it was played, and the outcome is unknown. In that case, the market should remain open, but according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. This is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the result is not in the provided sources, but the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs. Since none of the provided URLs report the result, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user's personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user didn't provide specific URLs, but the search results are the context. Since the search results don't include the June 7 game's outcome, the resolution can't be determined from the provided sources, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the MLB game between the Texas Rangers and Washington Nationals on June 7, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Nationals win, p2 for Rangers win, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game occurred as scheduled. The current date is June 7, 2025, 10:27 PM UTC, which is 6:27 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, so it should have already taken place. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's no direct mention of the June 7 game's outcome. However, there are details about the previous game on June 6 where the Nationals won 2-0. The June 7 game is mentioned in sources [6], [8], [10], and [14]. Source [6] predicts a Rangers win, [8] lists the starting pitchers as deGrom for Rangers and Parker for Nationals, and [10] provides betting picks favoring the Rangers. Source [14] seems to be a box score placeholder but doesn't show actual results yet.\n\nSince the game time has passed, but there's no reported outcome in the provided sources, I need to check if there's any postponement or cancellation info. Sources [4] mention past postponements in May 2025, but nothing about June 7. The user's resolution conditions state that if the game is postponed, the market remains open, and if canceled, resolves to p3. However, there's no indication of postponement or cancellation in the search results.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit results, I should infer based on the most probable outcome. The user instructions say if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info exists, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p2 as Rangers win. However, the betting predictions in [6] and [10] suggest Rangers were favored, but without confirmation, it's risky. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome per the user's prompt conditions. Since the user's ancillary data doesn't specify defaulting to p3 unless canceled, and there's no evidence of cancellation, perhaps the correct resolution is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the resolution conditions are p1, p2, p3. Wait, the user's resolution_conditions are p1:0 (Nationals), p2:1 (Rangers), p3:0.5 (canceled). But the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on most probable outcome. However, the user's personalization also says if the event is in the past and no verifiable info, and the user prompt doesn't mention postponement, resolve based on most probable outcome. But without any sources confirming the result, maybe it's safer to return p4. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But the ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Nationals, p2: Rangers, p3: canceled. Since the game was scheduled for today, and it's past the time, but no sources report the outcome, perhaps the correct answer is p4 (cannot resolve). Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" But the problem is that the sources provided don't include the result of the June 7 game. All the search results about games are from June 6 or earlier. Therefore, there's no verifiable information about the June 7 game's outcome. In that case, according to the user's instructions, if no verifiable info, and the event date is past, assume the most probable outcome based on the user's prompt conditions. The user's prompt conditions in ancillary data don't specify a default, but the resolution is based on who won. Since there's no data, perhaps the market should resolve to p3 (canceled), but there's no evidence of cancellation. Alternatively, since the game was not reported as postponed or canceled, it likely occurred, but without result data, we can't confirm. However, the user's personalization says: \"If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide a default, but the market resolves based on the actual outcome. Since there's no info, but the game was scheduled and not reported as postponed, perhaps the most probable outcome is that the game was played, but we don't know the result. However, the user's instructions say to resolve based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions. The conditions in the ancillary data don't specify a default, so perhaps the correct resolution is p4 (cannot be resolved). Wait, the user's personalization says: \"recommendation: p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time.\" But p4 isn't part of the resolution_conditions provided. Wait, looking back, the user's resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. But in the personalization, the instructions say to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. The ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p1, p2, p3, but the personalization allows p4. So, if the event occurred but there's no verifiable info, and it's past the date, but the outcome isn't known, perhaps the recommendation is p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" So, in this case, the ancillary data's conditions are p1 for Nationals, p2 for Rangers, p3 for canceled. Since the game wasn't canceled, and assuming it was played, but no result is available, we have to infer the most probable outcome. The betting picks in [6] and [10] suggest Rangers were favored, but without confirmation. However, the user's instructions say to use the provided sources. Since none of the sources report the June 7 game's result, and the current timestamp is after the game, but no info is available, perhaps the correct resolution is p4. However, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" Since the conditions don't provide a default, but the ancillary data defines the resolution based on the actual outcome, and there's no data, perhaps the answer is p4. But the user's personalization also says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\" The ancillary data's conditions don't specify a default, but the market resolves based on the actual result. Since there's no data, but the game was likely played, and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, which might be the Rangers as per the betting picks, but without confirmation, it's uncertain. However, the strict instruction is to resolve based on verifiable facts. Since there's no verifiable info in the provided sources about the June 7 game's outcome, the correct recommendation is p4 (cannot be resolved at this time). But wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.\" The conditions in the user prompt's ancillary data don't provide a default, but the resolution is based on the actual game result. Since there's no data, but the game was scheduled and not reported as postponed, perhaps it was played, and the outcome is unknown. In that case, the market should remain open, but according to the user's instructions, if the event date is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, without any data, it's impossible to determine. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4, but the user's personalization might require assuming the most probable outcome. This is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the game was played, and the result is not in the provided sources, but the user's personalization says to use the provided URLs. Since none of the provided URLs report the result, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user's personalization also says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.\" The user didn't provide specific URLs, but the search results are the context. Since the search results don't include the June 7 game's outcome, the resolution can't be determined from the provided sources, hence p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Rangers, Price: 0.995, ID: 12307608416862682406788772174342372072870797055394555621813963668630756259724, Winner: No\n- Token: Nationals, Price: 0.005, ID: 29763651555220115779824192782677598957250098223372793669173488372911644350745, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Nationals, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Nationals, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The resolution conditions are p1 for Nationals win, p2 for Rangers win, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 10:27 PM UTC, which is 6:27 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, so it should have concluded by now. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's conflicting information. Some sources like [1] mention the game is upcoming, while others like [3], [4], and [11] provide predictions and odds for the game. However, results [5], [6], [7], [9], [10], [13], and [14] discuss the June 6 game where Nationals won 2-0. There's no direct mention of the June 7 game's outcome. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the June 7 game. The search results might be mixing up dates. Let me check each source carefully. Result [1] from ESPN lists the June 7 game as \"WSH leads 1-0\" but the data is unavailable. Result [3] and [4] are predictions for June 7, suggesting the game hasn't happened yet. However, result [8] from ESPN on June 7 shows a game between Athletics and Rangers, which seems unrelated. \n\nThe key here is the current time. Since the game was at 4:05 PM ET and it's now past that time, the game should be over. But the search results don't provide a conclusive outcome. The absence of post-game reports for June 7 might indicate the game was postponed or data isn't available yet. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data mentions if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled, resolve to 50-50. Since the game date is in the past, and there's no info on postponement or cancellation, I need to check if there's any indication of the game being played. The predictions in [3] and [4] suggest the game was expected to proceed. Without evidence of postponement, the most probable outcome based on starting pitchers (deGrom vs. Parker) and team performance might lean towards Rangers, but without verified results, it's uncertain. \n\nHowever, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info exists, assume the most probable outcome. But since the game's actual result isn't found in the sources, and the user's previous response was p4, maybe the correct approach is p4 again due to lack of data. Wait, the user says to try again, considering market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Nationals, p2: Rangers. If the game wasn't played, it's p3. But without info, maybe default to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the probable outcome? The predictions in [3] and [4] suggest Rangers might win, but those are just predictions. Since there's no actual result reported, and the game time has passed, it's possible the game was played but data isn't available. Alternatively, maybe it was postponed. But without explicit sources stating that, I can't confirm. \n\nGiven the strict rules, if there's no verifiable info on the outcome, and the event date is past, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a p4, but the user's system says to return p4 if unresolved. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to end with recommendation p1-p4. p4 is for unable to resolve. \n\nSince there's no conclusive evidence the game was played or its result, and the current time is after the scheduled time, but no sources report the outcome, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to try again, check alternative sources. But all provided sources don't have the June 7 result. Therefore, despite the game date being past, without verified results, p4 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Please try again with a different approach or by checking alternative data sources. If the issue is with data availability or API access, consider whether the market conditions provided in the prompt could help inform the recommendation.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a UMA optimistic oracle request for the Rangers vs. Nationals game on June 7, 2025, at 4:05 PM ET. The resolution conditions are p1 for Nationals win, p2 for Rangers win, and p3 if the game is canceled. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the game has already happened. The current timestamp is June 7, 2025, 10:27 PM UTC, which is 6:27 PM ET. The game was scheduled for 4:05 PM ET, so it should have concluded by now. \n\nLooking at the search results, there's conflicting information. Some sources like [1] mention the game is upcoming, while others like [3], [4], and [11] provide predictions and odds for the game. However, results [5], [6], [7], [9], [10], [13], and [14] discuss the June 6 game where Nationals won 2-0. There's no direct mention of the June 7 game's outcome. \n\nWait, the user's query is about the June 7 game. The search results might be mixing up dates. Let me check each source carefully. Result [1] from ESPN lists the June 7 game as \"WSH leads 1-0\" but the data is unavailable. Result [3] and [4] are predictions for June 7, suggesting the game hasn't happened yet. However, result [8] from ESPN on June 7 shows a game between Athletics and Rangers, which seems unrelated. \n\nThe key here is the current time. Since the game was at 4:05 PM ET and it's now past that time, the game should be over. But the search results don't provide a conclusive outcome. The absence of post-game reports for June 7 might indicate the game was postponed or data isn't available yet. However, the user's personalization instructions state that if the event date is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. \n\nThe ancillary data mentions if the game is postponed, the market remains open. If canceled, resolve to 50-50. Since the game date is in the past, and there's no info on postponement or cancellation, I need to check if there's any indication of the game being played. The predictions in [3] and [4] suggest the game was expected to proceed. Without evidence of postponement, the most probable outcome based on starting pitchers (deGrom vs. Parker) and team performance might lean towards Rangers, but without verified results, it's uncertain. \n\nHowever, the user's instruction says if no verifiable info exists, assume the most probable outcome. But since the game's actual result isn't found in the sources, and the user's previous response was p4, maybe the correct approach is p4 again due to lack of data. Wait, the user says to try again, considering market conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions are p1: Nationals, p2: Rangers. If the game wasn't played, it's p3. But without info, maybe default to p4. However, the user's personalization says if the event date is past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nBut how to determine the probable outcome? The predictions in [3] and [4] suggest Rangers might win, but those are just predictions. Since there's no actual result reported, and the game time has passed, it's possible the game was played but data isn't available. Alternatively, maybe it was postponed. But without explicit sources stating that, I can't confirm. \n\nGiven the strict rules, if there's no verifiable info on the outcome, and the event date is past, but the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data's resolution conditions don't have a p4, but the user's system says to return p4 if unresolved. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1, p2, p3. The user's personalization says to end with recommendation p1-p4. p4 is for unable to resolve. \n\nSince there's no conclusive evidence the game was played or its result, and the current time is after the scheduled time, but no sources report the outcome, the correct recommendation is p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to try again, check alternative sources. But all provided sources don't have the June 7 result. Therefore, despite the game date being past, without verified results, p4 is appropriate.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p4\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Rangers, Price: 0.995, ID: 12307608416862682406788772174342372072870797055394555621813963668630756259724, Winner: No\n- Token: Nationals, Price: 0.005, ID: 29763651555220115779824192782677598957250098223372793669173488372911644350745, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Nationals, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Nationals, p2 = Rangers\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Rangers outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.995 = 99.5% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749335221 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-07 22:27:01 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Your previous response returned p4.

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Available Crypto Data Sources:\n    - Binance: Provides cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies\n  * Available Sports Data Sources:\n    - Sports Data IO - MLB (baseball): MLB baseball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NBA (basketball): NBA basketball scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NFL (football): NFL football scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - NHL (hockey): NHL hockey scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CFB (college football): College Football (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n    - Sports Data IO - CBB (college basketball): College Basketball (NCAA) scores, statistics, and game data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Rangers vs. Nationals, description: In the upcoming MLB game, scheduled for June 7 at 4:05PM ET:\nIf the Texas Rangers win, the market will resolve to \"Rangers\".\nIf the Washington Nationals win, the market will resolve to \"Nationals\".\nIf the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.\nIf the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.\nTo know when a postponed game will be played, please check the home team's schedule on MLB.com for the listed team and look for the game described as a makeup game.\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Nationals, p2 to Rangers, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Including: \"What was the price of BTC on April 9th at noon ET?\", \"Was Ethereum higher or lower at the end of yesterday than at the start?\"\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: baseball (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\"), basketball (e.g., \"Who won the Lakers vs Warriors game?\"), football (e.g., \"Did the Eagles cover the spread against the Cowboys?\"), hockey (e.g., \"Did the Maple Leafs win yesterday?\"), college football (e.g., \"What was the score of the Alabama game last Saturday?\"), college basketball (e.g., \"What was Duke's score in their last game?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
