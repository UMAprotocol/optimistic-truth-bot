Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope.

You will also provide a critique of the response and suggest improvements if necessary.\n\nORIGINAL QUERY:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 11, 8AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTCUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTCUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550889\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9955, ID: 20889713848861141042331931648948793054534042762772373639184946970074037022792, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0045, ID: 24694004326740459191910296995351281286302880575599021624989112884246676310953, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTCUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550889\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt.

Recommendation found: p3.\n\nOutput:\nrecommendation: p3\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p3\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9955, ID: 20889713848861141042331931648948793054534042762772373639184946970074037022792, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0045, ID: 24694004326740459191910296995351281286302880575599021624989112884246676310953, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTCUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550889\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT:\nYou are an artificial intelligence oracle tasked with resolving UMA optimistic oracle requests based strictly on verified facts. Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nADDITIONAL CODE EVALUATION CRITERIA:\nFor code runner solutions, please evaluate:\n1. Whether the code correctly extracts and interprets the data needed from APIs\n2. Whether the logic for determining the recommendation is correct\n3. If the code handles edge cases and errors appropriately\n4. If the API calls and data processing approach are sensible\n5. Whether the code correctly maps outcomes to recommendation codes (p1, p2, p3, p4)\n6. CRITICAL: Whether dates and times in the code match those specified in the market description exactly (pay close attention to date formats, timezones, and potential month/day swaps)\n7. CRITICAL: Whether the code outputs align with the expected results based on the market description (check for any discrepancies between output values and what should be expected)\n\nIMPORTANT: Be particularly vigilant about date-related errors. Check if the dates in the code output match exactly those mentioned in the market description. If there's any date mismatch (e.g., using March instead of April, or 2024 instead of 2025), this is an immediate FAILURE that requires a retry.\n\nVALIDATION REQUIREMENT: You MUST closely check any dates in the code output against those mentioned in the market description. If you detect ANY discrepancy (wrong month, wrong year, wrong day), you MUST return verdict \"RETRY\" and explicitly mention the date error in your critique.\n\nYour critique should focus both on the code correctness AND whether the final recommendation is justified by the data.\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve whether Bitcoin (BTCUSDT) went up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting at June 11, 8 AM ET. The outcome depends on the percentage change of that specific candle as reported by Binance.\n\nFirst, I need to convert 8 AM ET to UTC. From the search results, ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time. So 8 AM ET would be 12 PM UTC. That's confirmed by sources [1], [5], and [8], which show that ET to UTC is a 4-hour difference. So the candle in question starts at 12:00 UTC on June 11, 2025.\n\nNext, I need to check the BTCUSDT price data around that time. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the BTC price on June 11. Source [3] and [40] show the BTC/USDT rate on June 11 as 109,558.90 USDT with a -0.63% change. However, this might be the daily closing price. \n\nSource [25] and [47] provide real-time data, mentioning that on June 11, 2025, at 06:08 UTC, Bitcoin was at $109,505, up 1.7% in 24 hours. But this is before the 12:00 UTC candle. \n\nSource [42] mentions a whale opening a $400M position with a liquidation price, but the relevant info here is the 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC. \n\nThe key is the 1-hour candle starting at 12:00 UTC. The percentage change for that candle needs to be \u22650% for \"Up\" (p2) or <0% for \"Down\" (p1). \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 11, 13:08 UTC, the candle from 12:00 to 13:00 UTC hasn't closed yet. The user's current time is 13:08 UTC, so the event is in the future. Wait, no\u2014the current timestamp given is 2025-06-11 13:08:49 UTC. The candle in question starts at 12:00 UTC and ends at 13:00 UTC. Since the current time is 13:08, the candle has just closed. \n\nLooking for data on that specific 1-hour candle. Source [3] and [40] show historical data up to June 10, but not the specific hour. Source [25] and [47] mention real-time prices around 109,505 but don't specify the exact 1-hour change. \n\nHowever, source [66] (Binance's own BTC/USDT trading page) shows the 24h high as 110,400.00 and low as 108,331.03. The current price is 109,487.60. The 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC would have opened at the prior hour's close. If the price at 12:00 UTC was, say, 109,500 and at 13:00 UTC it's 109,487.60, that's a slight decrease. But without exact data, I need to infer.\n\nWait, the user provided search results up to [73], but none explicitly state the 1-hour change at 12:00 UTC. However, the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT pair. Since the event time has passed (current time is 13:08 UTC), the data should be available. But the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour change. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is found, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's current time is June 11, 13:08 UTC, so the candle closed at 13:00 UTC. The change would be based on Binance's data. \n\nSince the user's personalization says to use the specified URL (Binance's BTCUSDT), but the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour change, I have to rely on the available data. \n\nLooking at source [3], the BTC/USDT rate on June 11 is 109,558.90, but that's the daily close. The 1-hour candle's change isn't listed. However, source [25] mentions at 06:08 UTC, the price was 109,505, and later at 12:00 UTC, if the price decreased slightly, the change might be negative. \n\nAlternatively, if the price increased during that hour, it would be positive. Without explicit data, but considering the current price is 109,487.60 (from source [66]) and the 24h change is -0.63% (source [3]), it's possible the 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC had a negative change. \n\nBut this is speculative. According to the user's instructions, if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, the event time is exactly at the current time's hour. Wait, the current time is 13:08 UTC, and the candle closed at 13:00 UTC. The data should be available, but the provided search results don't include it. \n\nIn such a case, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data defines p1 as Down (change <0), p2 as Up (change \u22650). \n\nGiven the market's recent movement (source [3] shows a -0.63% daily change), but that's over 24h. The specific 1-hour candle might have a different trend. Without explicit data, but considering the instructions, if the event has occurred and no data is found, default to p4. However, the user's note says if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nSince the current time is after the event time (13:08 vs. 13:00), and assuming Binance's data shows the 1-hour change, but it's not in the provided sources, I have to make a judgment. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1-hour candle's change is derived from the price movement. If the price at 12:00 UTC was higher than at 13:00, it's down. If the price increased, it's up. \n\nLooking at source [66], the current price is 109,487.60. If the open at 12:00 was, say, 109,500, then the change is -0.01%, which is Down (p1). But without exact data, this is an assumption. \n\nHowever, the user's instructions say to resolve based on the specified URL. Since the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour change at 12:00 UTC, but the event time has passed, I have to conclude that the data isn't available in the provided context. Therefore, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the overall market data showing a slight decrease (source [3] shows a daily -0.63%), it's possible the 1-hour candle also decreased. Therefore, the resolution would be p1 (Down). But this is an assumption. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the event is considered to have occurred but data isn't available, the resolution would be p4. But the user's note says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the instructions to the best of the provided data, I'll recommend p1 (Down) as the probable outcome, assuming the 1-hour change was negative. However, this is uncertain without explicit data. But according to the user's guidelines, proceed with the most probable outcome.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

The user wants to resolve whether Bitcoin (BTCUSDT) went up or down based on the 1-hour candle starting at June 11, 8 AM ET. The outcome depends on the percentage change of that specific candle as reported by Binance.\n\nFirst, I need to convert 8 AM ET to UTC. From the search results, ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time. So 8 AM ET would be 12 PM UTC. That's confirmed by sources [1], [5], and [8], which show that ET to UTC is a 4-hour difference. So the candle in question starts at 12:00 UTC on June 11, 2025.\n\nNext, I need to check the BTCUSDT price data around that time. Looking at the search results, several sources mention the BTC price on June 11. Source [3] and [40] show the BTC/USDT rate on June 11 as 109,558.90 USDT with a -0.63% change. However, this might be the daily closing price. \n\nSource [25] and [47] provide real-time data, mentioning that on June 11, 2025, at 06:08 UTC, Bitcoin was at $109,505, up 1.7% in 24 hours. But this is before the 12:00 UTC candle. \n\nSource [42] mentions a whale opening a $400M position with a liquidation price, but the relevant info here is the 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC. \n\nThe key is the 1-hour candle starting at 12:00 UTC. The percentage change for that candle needs to be \u22650% for \"Up\" (p2) or <0% for \"Down\" (p1). \n\nSince the current timestamp is June 11, 13:08 UTC, the candle from 12:00 to 13:00 UTC hasn't closed yet. The user's current time is 13:08 UTC, so the event is in the future. Wait, no\u2014the current timestamp given is 2025-06-11 13:08:49 UTC. The candle in question starts at 12:00 UTC and ends at 13:00 UTC. Since the current time is 13:08, the candle has just closed. \n\nLooking for data on that specific 1-hour candle. Source [3] and [40] show historical data up to June 10, but not the specific hour. Source [25] and [47] mention real-time prices around 109,505 but don't specify the exact 1-hour change. \n\nHowever, source [66] (Binance's own BTC/USDT trading page) shows the 24h high as 110,400.00 and low as 108,331.03. The current price is 109,487.60. The 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC would have opened at the prior hour's close. If the price at 12:00 UTC was, say, 109,500 and at 13:00 UTC it's 109,487.60, that's a slight decrease. But without exact data, I need to infer.\n\nWait, the user provided search results up to [73], but none explicitly state the 1-hour change at 12:00 UTC. However, the resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT pair. Since the event time has passed (current time is 13:08 UTC), the data should be available. But the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour change. \n\nGiven the instructions, if the event date is in the past and no verifiable info is found, assume the most probable outcome. However, the user's current time is June 11, 13:08 UTC, so the candle closed at 13:00 UTC. The change would be based on Binance's data. \n\nSince the user's personalization says to use the specified URL (Binance's BTCUSDT), but the provided search results don't have the exact 1-hour change, I have to rely on the available data. \n\nLooking at source [3], the BTC/USDT rate on June 11 is 109,558.90, but that's the daily close. The 1-hour candle's change isn't listed. However, source [25] mentions at 06:08 UTC, the price was 109,505, and later at 12:00 UTC, if the price decreased slightly, the change might be negative. \n\nAlternatively, if the price increased during that hour, it would be positive. Without explicit data, but considering the current price is 109,487.60 (from source [66]) and the 24h change is -0.63% (source [3]), it's possible the 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC had a negative change. \n\nBut this is speculative. According to the user's instructions, if the event is in the past and no info is available, assume the most probable outcome. However, the event time is exactly at the current time's hour. Wait, the current time is 13:08 UTC, and the candle closed at 13:00 UTC. The data should be available, but the provided search results don't include it. \n\nIn such a case, the resolution would be p4 (cannot resolve). But the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The query's ancillary data defines p1 as Down (change <0), p2 as Up (change \u22650). \n\nGiven the market's recent movement (source [3] shows a -0.63% daily change), but that's over 24h. The specific 1-hour candle might have a different trend. Without explicit data, but considering the instructions, if the event has occurred and no data is found, default to p4. However, the user's note says if the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nSince the current time is after the event time (13:08 vs. 13:00), and assuming Binance's data shows the 1-hour change, but it's not in the provided sources, I have to make a judgment. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1-hour candle's change is derived from the price movement. If the price at 12:00 UTC was higher than at 13:00, it's down. If the price increased, it's up. \n\nLooking at source [66], the current price is 109,487.60. If the open at 12:00 was, say, 109,500, then the change is -0.01%, which is Down (p1). But without exact data, this is an assumption. \n\nHowever, the user's instructions say to resolve based on the specified URL. Since the provided search results don't include the exact 1-hour change at 12:00 UTC, but the event time has passed, I have to conclude that the data isn't available in the provided context. Therefore, per the user's instructions, if no verifiable information is available, and the event date is in the past, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the overall market data showing a slight decrease (source [3] shows a daily -0.63%), it's possible the 1-hour candle also decreased. Therefore, the resolution would be p1 (Down). But this is an assumption. However, the user's personalization says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nAlternatively, if the event is considered to have occurred but data isn't available, the resolution would be p4. But the user's note says if the event is in the past and no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the instructions to the best of the provided data, I'll recommend p1 (Down) as the probable outcome, assuming the 1-hour change was negative. However, this is uncertain without explicit data. But according to the user's guidelines, proceed with the most probable outcome.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Up, Price: 0.9955, ID: 20889713848861141042331931648948793054534042762772373639184946970074037022792, Winner: No\n- Token: Down, Price: 0.0045, ID: 24694004326740459191910296995351281286302880575599021624989112884246676310953, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available. In that case, state explicitly that your assessment does not include market data considerations.\n\nRemember, your goal is to ensure that UMA token holders receive accurate and well-reasoned recommendations for their queries.\n",

The user wants to resolve a market that depends on whether the BTCUSDT 1-hour candle starting at June 11, 8 AM ET (which is 12:00 UTC) had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle once finalized.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle.

However, these tables are daily closing prices at 00:00 UTC, not the specific 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC.\n\nSource [5] also mentions that on June 11, 2025, BTC/USDT trading volume peaked at 1.2 million BTC between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM UTC, indicating high activity, but doesn't specify the exact percentage change for the 12:00 UTC candle.\n\nSource [60] from latestly.com states that on June 11, 2025, Bitcoin's price recovered to $109,815.33 after a minor dip, but the time specified is 8:49 AM IST, which is 3:19 UTC, not the 12:00 UTC candle.\n\nSource [58] provides a forecast for June 11, 2025, mentioning BTC/USD quotes at 108,766, but this is a forecast and not actual data.\n\nThe key here is to find the exact percentage change for the 1-hour candle starting at 12:00 UTC. The search results don't explicitly state this, but source [5] mentions a 40% increase in trading volume between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM UTC, which might correlate with price movement. However, without the exact percentage change for that specific hour, I need to infer from available data.\n\nGiven that the daily closing price on June 11, 2025, as per sources [2] and [21], shows a -0.63% change, but this is the daily close at 00:00 UTC. The 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC would be part of the same day's trading. If the overall daily trend was negative, but the specific hour in question might have had a positive change.\n\nHowever, without explicit data for the 12:00 UTC 1-hour candle, the answer must rely on the most probable outcome based on available information. If the event date is in the past and no verifiable information is found, the instructions say to assume the most probable outcome. Since the current timestamp is 2025-06-11 13:08:49 UTC, the 12:00 UTC candle has already closed. If the change was negative, the resolution would be \"Down\" (p1). If positive, \"Up\" (p2). \n\nBut the search results don't provide the exact figure. However, source [5] mentions a breakout above $69,000 at 10:00 AM UTC, reaching $71,500, which might indicate a positive trend during that period. If the price continued to rise past 12:00 UTC, the change could be positive. Alternatively, if it corrected after the peak, it might be negative.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, but considering the market's requirement to resolve based on Binance's data, and if no contradictory information is found, the safest assumption might be to check the 1-hour candle's close. If the close is higher than the open, it's Up. If not, Down. However, without the exact numbers, I might have to default to p4 (cannot resolve), but the instructions say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome based on conditions. The ancillary data defines p1 as Down, p2 as Up. \n\nSince the daily change was -0.63%, but that's for the entire day, not the specific hour. The 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC could have a different change. Given the ambiguity, but considering the market's parameters, if the 1-hour candle's change is >=0, it's Up. If not, Down. Without explicit data, but given the overall negative daily trend, perhaps the 1-hour candle was also negative. However, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, if the user provided a URL in the query, I should check that. The resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT pair page. Since I can't access live data, but the current timestamp is after the event, I should look for the 1H candle's change at 12:00 UTC. \n\nIn the absence of explicit data in the provided sources, but considering the instructions to use the specified source (Binance) and the ancillary data, if the change is not verifiable, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to use the specified source (Binance) and ensure alignment with market sentiment. \n\nGiven that, and if the search results don't provide the exact percentage, but the daily close was negative, but the specific hour might have been positive, but without confirmation, the safest recommendation is p4. However, the instructions also say if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. \n\nWait, the current timestamp is 2025-06-11 13:08:49 UTC, so the 12:00 UTC candle (1-hour) would have closed at 13:00 UTC. The current time is 13:08, so the data should be available. However, the provided search results don't include the exact change for that candle. \n\nGiven that, and following the instructions, if the data isn't available in the provided sources, answer as best as possible. Since the user insists on using Binance data, but the search results don't have the exact figure, perhaps the answer is p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to \"reevaluate the query using the specified source (Binance) to obtain the exact data for the 1-hour candle change at 12:00 UTC on June 11, 2025\".\n\nSince the provided search results don't include this exact data point, but the current time is after the candle closed, and assuming the data is available on Binance but not in the provided context, the assistant can't access live data. Therefore, based on the provided sources, if no exact data is found, the recommendation would be p4. However, the user might expect the assistant to infer from nearby data. \n\nLooking at source [5], which mentions a peak at 10:00 AM UTC and high volume between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM UTC, but the 12:00 UTC candle's change isn't specified. If the price was rising during that period, the 12:00 candle might be positive. Alternatively, if it peaked earlier and started to drop, it might be negative. \n\nWithout explicit data, but considering the instructions to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past, and given the daily change was negative, perhaps the 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC was also negative. Therefore, the recommendation would be p1 (Down). However, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, if the 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC had a positive change, it would be p2. But without data, the correct answer is p4. However, the user's instruction says if the event is in the past and no info, assume the most probable outcome. The query's ancillary data defines p1 as Down (change <0), p2 as Up (change >=0). \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but to comply with the instructions, if no data is found, the recommendation is p4. However, the user's additional instruction says to use Binance data. Since the provided sources don't have the exact figure, but the current time is after the event, the correct answer is p4. But the user might expect the assistant to find the data in the provided sources. \n\nRechecking the sources, source [5] mentions that on June 11, 2025, at 10:00 AM UTC, BTC surpassed its previous ATH, reaching $71,500. The 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC would be two hours later. If the price continued to rise, the change would be positive. However, if it corrected, it might be negative. \n\nAnother source, [60], mentions Bitcoin's price at 8:49 AM IST (3:19 UTC) as $109,815.33, but this is before the 12:00 UTC candle. \n\nGiven the lack of explicit data, but the instruction to assume the most probable outcome, and considering the daily change was -0.63%, perhaps the 1-hour candle was also negative. Therefore, the recommendation is p1 (Down). However, this is an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, if the 12:00 UTC candle was part of the upward movement mentioned in source [5], it might be positive. But without exact data, it's uncertain. \n\nIn conclusion, without explicit data in the provided sources for the specific 1-hour candle at 12:00 UTC on June 11, 2025, but following the instruction to assume the most probable outcome if the event is in the past, and considering the daily trend was slightly negative, the recommendation would be p1 (Down). However, this is not certain. If the assistant cannot verify the exact change, the correct answer is p4. But the user's instruction says to use Binance data, which isn't explicitly provided here. Therefore, the safest recommendation is p4.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p4",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1749647329 Current Date and Time: 2025-06-11 13:08:49 UTC\n\nADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS: Please reevaluate the query using the specified source (Binance) to obtain the exact data for the 1-hour candle change at 12:00 UTC on June 11, 2025, and ensure alignment with market sentiment.\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to resolve a market that depends on whether the BTCUSDT 1-hour candle starting at June 11, 8 AM ET (which is 12:00 UTC) had a percentage change greater than or equal to 0. The resolution source is Binance's BTCUSDT pair, specifically the change value displayed for that 1H candle once finalized.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the exact time of the candle. The title mentions June 11, 8 AM ET. ET is UTC-4 during daylight saving time, so 8 AM ET would be 12:00 UTC. The candle in question is the 1-hour candle starting at 12:00 UTC on June 11, 2025.\n\nNext, I need to check the provided search results for data around that time. Looking through the sources, several mention June 11, 2025. For example, source [5] states that on June 11, 2025, at approximately 10:00 AM UTC, BTC surpassed its previous ATH, reaching a peak of $71,500. However, this is earlier than the 12:00 UTC candle. \n\nSource [2] and [21] provide a rate history table showing that on June 11, 2025, the BTC to USDT rate was 109,558.90 USDT with a -0.63% change.

Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = Down, p2 = Up\n\nInterpretation: Market STRONGLY favors Up outcome (maps to p2 in resolution conditions) (0.996 = 99.6% confidence)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nMARKET ALIGNMENT EVALUATION PROCESS:\n1. First, identify what outcome the solver's recommendation actually means using the resolution conditions mapping\n2. Then, check if the market sentiment favors that same outcome\n3. If they ALIGN (both favor the same outcome), this is GOOD - set verdict to SATISFIED\n4. If they CONTRADICT (market strongly favors one outcome but solver recommends the opposite), this is BAD\n\nONLY apply the contradiction rule if there is an ACTUAL contradiction:\n- If the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) AND the solver recommendation maps to the OPPOSITE outcome, then you MUST:\n  1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n  2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n  3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT apply the contradiction rule if the market and solver AGREE on the same outcome!\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.

Your task is to analyze the provided query and decide which AI solver is best suited to handle it.\n\nAvailable solvers: perplexity\n\nSolver descriptions:\n- perplexity: Uses the Perplexity AI search engine to find information online to answer general questions. Best for:\n  * Historical data and events\n  * General knowledge questions requiring context\n  * Questions needing interpretation of complex information\n  * Has knowledge cutoff and may not have very recent information\n\n- code_runner: Executes code to fetch real-time data from specific APIs. Currently supports:\n  * Binance API: Can fetch cryptocurrency prices at specific times/dates with timezone conversion\n  * Sports Data IO: Can retrieve sports data from various leagues\n  * Currently available data sources based on API keys:\n    - MLB (Major League Baseball) data\n  * Best for questions requiring precise, current data from these specific sources\n  * Limited to only these data sources - cannot access other APIs or general information\n\nUSER PROMPT:\nuser:\n\nancillary_data:\nq: title: Bitcoin Up or Down - June 11, 8AM ET, description: This market will resolve to \"Up\" if the change for BTCUSDT, measured in percentage, is greater than or equal to 0 for the 1 Hour candle that begins on the time and date specified in the title. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"Down\".\n\nThe resolution source for this market is information from Binance, specifically the BTCUSDT pair (https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT). The change value displayed at the top of the graph for the relevant \"1H\" candle will be used once the data for that candle is finalized.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Binance BTCUSDT, not according to other sources or spot markets market_id: 550889\n\nresolution_conditions:\nres_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to Down, p2 to Up, p3 to unknown/50-50.\n\n\n\nPlease analyze the prompt carefully, considering:\n1. The complexity of the query\n2. The type of information needed\n3. Whether the question requires specialized knowledge or data access\n4. Whether the question specifically involves cryptocurrency prices or sports data\n5. Whether multiple approaches might be complementary\n\nIMPORTANT: You SHOULD select MULTIPLE solvers when appropriate. For complementary approaches, multiple solvers can provide different perspectives on the same question.\n\nOVERSEER GUIDANCE:\nBased on previous attempts to solve this question, the overseer has provided the following guidance:\nThe code_runner solver has repeatedly produced results that contradict strong market signals. Try other solvers or a combination approach. Consider including the perplexity solver which may have more current information about this event.\n\nPlease take this guidance into account when making your decision.\n\nNOTE: The following solvers have been EXCLUDED due to previous failures or overseer feedback: code_runner\n\nReturn your answer in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"solvers\": [\"solver_name1\", \"solver_name2\"],\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why these solvers are best suited\",\n  \"multi_solver_strategy\": \"Optional explanation of how these solvers complement each other\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- solvers: Array of solver names selected from the available solvers\n- reason: A brief explanation of why you selected these solvers\n- multi_solver_strategy: If multiple solvers are selected, explain how they complement each other\n\nGuidelines for solver selection:\n- Use code_runner when the question specifically asks for:\n  * Current or historical cryptocurrency prices from Binance (e.g., \"What was the price of BTC on March 30th at 12pm ET?\")\n  * Sports data results, scores or team performance from available sources (e.g., \"Did the Blue Jays win against the Orioles on April 1st?\")\n  * Specifically for: MLB baseball games (e.g., \"Did the Yankees win yesterday?\")\n  \n- Use perplexity when the question requires:\n  * General knowledge or context not limited to specific data points\n  * Explanation or interpretation of events, rules, or concepts\n  * Information beyond just crypto prices or MLB sports data\n  \n- Use both solvers when:\n  * The question needs both factual data AND context/interpretation\n  * Example: \"Did BTC price increase after the news about XYZ on March 30th?\" (code_runner for price data, perplexity for news context)\n  * Example: \"How did the Blue Jays perform compared to expectations in their April 1st game?\" (code_runner for game data, perplexity for context about expectations)\n\nRemember: code_runner is highly accurate for the supported data types but limited in scope. Perplexity has broader knowledge but may not have the most current information.\n",
