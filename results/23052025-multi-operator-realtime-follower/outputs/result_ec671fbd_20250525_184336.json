The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any transcripts or mentions of Powell's speech. The search results include several sources. Let's go through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple mentions of Powell's speech at Princeton. For example, result [4] is a YouTube video titled \"LIVE: Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Remarks at Princeton Baccalaureate\" from May 25, 2025. Similarly, result [6] is another YouTube link from CNBC-TV18 covering the same event. These videos might have the actual speech, but since I can't watch them, I need to look for transcripts or summaries.\n\nResult [2] and [18] mention that Powell was selected as the Baccalaureate speaker, but they don't provide speech content. Result [9] from the Federal Reserve's calendar notes that Powell's speech was scheduled for 2:40 PM on May 25, 2025, at Princeton. \n\nResult [35] from Princeton's news site states that the Baccalaureate service was held on May 25, 2025, with Powell as the speaker. It also mentions that the event was livestreamed, but again, no transcript.\n\nResult [57] is a transcript of a 2013 Baccalaureate speech by Ben Bernanke, which isn't relevant here. Result [63] is a 2020 speech by Powell, which is also not related to the 2025 event.\n\nResult [64] from the Daily Princetonian provides more context. It mentions that Powell's speech was part of the Baccalaureate ceremony and includes a quote from a student who attended a seminar with Powell, but no direct quotes from the speech itself. \n\nResult [67] is a 2024 press conference transcript, not relevant. Result [70] is another 2020 speech. \n\nThe key point is that none of the provided search results include a transcript of Powell's actual speech on May 25, 2025. There are videos (results [4], [6], [20], [33]) but no text to confirm if \"America\" was mentioned. \n\nSince the resolution source is video of the event and there's no transcript available in the provided data, I can't definitively confirm whether Powell said \"America.\" However, considering the nature of commencement speeches and Powell's role as Fed Chair, it's common to reference the country. But without explicit evidence, the answer must rely on available data.\n\nThe user's personalization instructions state that if no verifiable information is available and the event date is in the past (which it is, May 25, 2025, and current date is May 25, 2025), we should assume the most probable outcome. However, the instructions also say that if the event is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But since the event happened, and there's no evidence in the provided sources, the safe answer is to recommend p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's ancillary data says if no info, resolve to p2 (Yes) if probable. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data says the market resolves to \"No\" if the event is canceled or not aired. Since the event did occur (as per sources [2], [35], etc.), but there's no transcript, we have to infer. However, the user's instructions say to answer based on the provided search results. Since none of the search results confirm the use of \"America,\" but the event happened, and the user's instructions say if no info, assume the most probable outcome. Given that commencement speeches often mention the country, but without evidence, the correct resolution would be p4 (unknown). However, the resolution conditions only have p1, p2, p3. Wait, the resolution_conditions are p1: No, p2: Yes, p3: 0.5. But the user's personalization says to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. Wait, the initial instructions say to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. So the market resolves to p2 (Yes) if the term was said, p1 (No) if not, p3 if uncertain. However, the user's personalization says if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. Since the event occurred, but no transcript is available in the provided sources, and the user requires using the provided search results, which don't confirm the term, the answer should be p1 (No) because there's no evidence in the provided data. However, this is tricky. Alternatively, if the event happened and the user's instructions say to assume the most probable outcome, but the provided sources don't have the transcript, maybe it's p3. But the user's personalization says if no info, resolve based on the most probable outcome. Since Powell is a U.S. official, it's likely he mentioned \"America,\" but without evidence, per the rules, if no sources confirm it, it should resolve to No. But the user's instructions say to use the provided search results. Since none of the search results include the transcript, and the resolution source is the video, which isn't available here, the answer is p4? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis...\" The user provided a URL in the query (princeton.edu/news/2024/11/26...), which is result [2] and [18], but those don't have the speech content. The other sources don't have the transcript. Therefore, based on the provided search results, there's no evidence that Powell said \"America,\" so the resolution should be p1 (No). But wait, the user's personalization says if the event occurred but no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the market rules state that if the event is not aired by May 26, resolve to No. Since the event was aired (as per sources [4], [6], [8], [35]), but no transcript is available in the provided data, and the user's instructions require using only the provided sources, which don't confirm the term, the resolution should be p1 (No). Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1",

Your primary function is to analyze factual information about events that have already occurred, not to predict future outcomes. Report only on what has definitively happened and can be verified through reliable sources. Your responses must be based solely on concrete evidence and established facts.If an event has occurred, verify the occurrence and context of the event as specified in the user prompt, ensuring accuracy in understanding the specific event in question and the exact terms required for resolution. If no verifiable information about the event's outcome, postponement, or cancellation is provided, and the event date is in the past relative to the current timestamp, assume the most probable outcome based on the conditions provided in the user prompt unless explicitly contradicted by reliable sources.IMPORTANT: Always check if the event in question is scheduled for a future date or time relative to this timestamp. If the event is scheduled for a future date or time or has not occurred yet, ALWAYS return p4 to indicate the request cannot be resolved at this time. If an event is scheduled for the same day but at a later time (e.g., current time is 11 AM and event is at 3 PM today), it is still a future event.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis and heavily bias your reasoning towards the content at these URLs.IMPORTANT: Always ensure that the event you are resolving is the same event mentioned in the user prompt. Do not resolve for an event that might be similar but not exactly specified in the user prompt. If the details or the context of the event mentioned in the user prompt differ from the sources found, do not use these sources for resolution.IMPORTANT: Align your response with the ancillary data provided in the user prompt, which defines how the market should resolve under different outcomes (e.g., p1 for Team A win, p2 for Team B win, etc.). Ensure that your resolution recommendation directly corresponds with the definitions provided in ancillary data.IMPORTANT: If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data. If the event outcome can be reasonably inferred from the available information, proceed with the corresponding resolution; otherwise, default to p4.IMPORTANT: Ensure strict adherence to the specific conditions outlined in the user prompt, such as the precise setting of the event and any stipulations about which parts of the event are relevant for resolution. For example, if the event includes both a private meeting and a public press conference, and only the public press conference is relevant for resolution, disregard information from the private meeting.IMPORTANT: When analyzing events for which specific terms or phrases are relevant to the resolution, ensure your evaluation is strictly limited to verifiable instances within the context explicitly outlined in the user prompt. Do not consider implied or indirect references unless specified by the user prompt. This precision is crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the resolution.IMPORTANT: Verify the exact occurrence of the event as stated in the user prompt. Do not rely on similar events or general activity around the event date. Make sure that the resolution is based on the specific event and its verifiable outcomes as per the user prompt and the provided resolution conditions.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt contains updates, use them to update your analysis and resolution and bias your reasoning towards the updates in totality. If the updates contradict the user prompt, use the updates to update your analysis and resolution.IMPORTANT: If the user prompt is related to a video of any kind be absolutely certain that the video is related to the event in question.IMPORTANT: If you need to write python code to analyze the data, do so and return the output of the python code in your response.Always end your response with your recommendation formatted as `recommendation: p1`, `recommendation: p2`, `recommendation: p3`, or `recommendation: p4`.Current Unix Timestamp: 1748198490 Current Date and Time: 2025-05-25 18:41:30 UTC\n\nRESPONSE FROM PERPLEXITY SOLVER:\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if Jerome Powell said the word \"America\" during his Princeton Baccalaureate speech on May 25, 2025. The market resolves to \"Yes\" if he did, \"No\" if not. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided search results for any transcripts or mentions of Powell's speech. The search results include several sources. Let's go through them.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are multiple mentions of Powell's speech at Princeton. For example, result [4] is a YouTube video titled \"LIVE: Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Remarks at Princeton Baccalaureate\" from May 25, 2025. Similarly, result [6] is another YouTube link from CNBC-TV18 covering the same event. These videos might have the actual speech, but since I can't watch them, I need to look for transcripts or summaries.\n\nResult [2] and [18] mention that Powell was selected as the Baccalaureate speaker, but they don't provide speech content. Result [9] from the Federal Reserve's calendar notes that Powell's speech was scheduled for 2:40 PM on May 25, 2025, at Princeton. \n\nResult [35] from Princeton's news site states that the Baccalaureate service was held on May 25, 2025, with Powell as the speaker.

Result [70] is another 2020 speech. \n\nThe key point is that none of the provided search results include a transcript of Powell's actual speech on May 25, 2025. There are videos (results [4], [6], [20], [33]) but no text to confirm if \"America\" was mentioned. \n\nSince the resolution source is video of the event and there's no transcript available in the provided data, I can't definitively confirm whether Powell said \"America.\" However, considering the nature of commencement speeches and Powell's role as Fed Chair, it's common to reference the country.

However, the instructions also say that if the event is in the past and no info is available, resolve based on the most probable outcome. But since the event happened, and there's no evidence in the provided sources, the safe answer is to recommend p4 (cannot resolve). However, the user's ancillary data says if no info, resolve to p2 (Yes) if probable. Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the event date is in the past, but no verifiable information on the outcome is available, and the user prompt does not specify that the event was postponed or canceled, resolve the query based on the most probable outcome as per the conditions provided in the user prompt and ancillary data.\"\n\nThe ancillary data says the market resolves to \"No\" if the event is canceled or not aired.

Wait, the initial instructions say to end with recommendation: p1, p2, p3, or p4. But the ancillary data's resolution_conditions have p1:0, p2:1, p3:0.5. So the market resolves to p2 (Yes) if the term was said, p1 (No) if not, p3 if uncertain. However, the user's personalization says if no verifiable info, resolve based on most probable outcome. Since the event occurred, but no transcript is available in the provided sources, and the user requires using the provided search results, which don't confirm the term, the answer should be p1 (No) because there's no evidence in the provided data.

Since none of the search results include the transcript, and the resolution source is the video, which isn't available here, the answer is p4? Wait, the user's personalization says: \"If the user prompt contains a URL(s), and specifies it as the source of reasoning and resolution, ONLY use these URLs for your analysis...\" The user provided a URL in the query (princeton.edu/news/2024/11/26...), which is result [2] and [18], but those don't have the speech content. The other sources don't have the transcript. Therefore, based on the provided search results, there's no evidence that Powell said \"America,\" so the resolution should be p1 (No). But wait, the user's personalization says if the event occurred but no info, assume the most probable outcome. However, the market rules state that if the event is not aired by May 26, resolve to No. Since the event was aired (as per sources [4], [6], [8], [35]), but no transcript is available in the provided data, and the user's instructions require using only the provided sources, which don't confirm the term, the resolution should be p1 (No). Therefore, the recommendation is p1.\n</think>\n\nrecommendation: p1\n\nRECOMMENDATION FROM SOLVER: p1\n\n\nMARKET PRICE INFORMATION:\nToken Prices from Polymarket:\n- Token: Yes, Price: 0.355, ID: 74737407713301907126943927533232761562948314540926945007413519630707630405686, Winner: No\n- Token: No, Price: 0.645, ID: 27193702953449044642433949341002310548461325488684078889784064079595734064947, Winner: No\n\nResolution Conditions: res_data:p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0.5. Where p1 corresponds to No, p2 to Yes, p3 to unknown/50-50.\nResolution mapping: p1 = No, p2 = Yes\n\nInterpretation: Market is relatively uncertain (YES: 0.355, NO: 0.645)\n\n\nPlease evaluate this response and recommendation according to the following criteria:\n1. Is the information provided accurate and relevant to the query?\n2. Is there sufficient information to make a definitive recommendation?\n3. Is the recommendation (p1, p2, p3, p4) consistent with the information provided?\n4. Does the response answer all aspects of the query?\n5. Are there any notable omissions or errors in the response?\n6. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Does the recommendation align with market sentiment? If there is a STRONG market sentiment (>85% confidence) that contradicts the solver's recommendation, this is a serious issue requiring immediate action.\n\nBased on your evaluation, determine one of the following verdicts:\n- SATISFIED: The response is accurate and complete, and the recommendation is justified.\n- RETRY: The response needs improvement or contains inaccuracies that should be addressed.\n- DEFAULT_TO_P4: The response quality is unsatisfactory, and the system should default to a p4 recommendation.\n\nSpecial Market Alignment Rule:\nVERY IMPORTANT: When checking market alignment, you MUST carefully consider the resolution conditions mapping first. For example, if \"p1 corresponds to Texas Rangers\", then a recommendation of \"p1\" means Texas Rangers wins, and you should check if this aligns with market sentiment for Texas Rangers, NOT by the p1 label itself.\n\nIf you are provided with resolution conditions that map p1, p2, p3 to specific outcomes, you must use those mappings when determining if the recommendation aligns with market sentiment.\n\nOnly after correctly interpreting the recommendation through resolution conditions mapping, if the market STRONGLY favors a specific outcome (>85% confidence) but the solver recommendation contradicts this without compelling evidence, you MUST:\n1. Set verdict to DEFAULT_TO_P4\n2. Explicitly note this market/solver disagreement in your critique\n3. In prompt_update, suggest trying a different solver because the current one is producing results that conflict with strong market signals\n\nIMPORTANT: Return your evaluation in a specific format:\n```decision\n{\n  \"verdict\": \"SATISFIED/RETRY/DEFAULT_TO_P4\",\n  \"require_rerun\": true/false,\n  \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of your verdict\",\n  \"critique\": \"Detailed critique of the response\",\n  \"market_alignment\": \"Statement about whether the recommendation aligns with market data or a note about the absence of market data\",\n  \"prompt_update\": \"Optional additional instructions for a rerun\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- verdict: Your verdict (SATISFIED, RETRY, or DEFAULT_TO_P4)\n- require_rerun: Boolean indicating whether another attempt should be made\n- reason: Brief explanation of your verdict (1-2 sentences)\n- critique: Detailed critique of the response, including strengths and weaknesses\n- market_alignment: REQUIRED field explaining alignment with market data or noting its absence\n- prompt_update: Additional instructions to include in the prompt for a rerun (leave empty if not needed)\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST include the market_alignment field in your decision, even if market data is not available.
